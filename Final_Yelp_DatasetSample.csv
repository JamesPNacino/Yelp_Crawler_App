https://www.yelp.com//biz/a-little-taste-new-york,a-little-taste-new-york,New York,10001,NY,Cafes,Desserts,Modern European,"By far the best coffee shop in the area. ALT offers the best cold brew (with coffee ice cubes) and Americanos I've had. Their coffee leans towards the strong side but does not ever taste bitter. The baristas have found a way to brew coffee such that it does its job (wake you up) without leaving you with the usual aftertaste one gets from mediocre brews. The cozy patina may at first seem cramped or small, but how much better it is than a dozen desks full of people working or in meetings. The atmosphere you get at ALT is that people come here to relax, take a break from work, talk, and enjoy the city.Most customers do not stay so the three stools they have for sitting are surprisingly available if you do need somewhere to sit down for a bit.The current employees (Jake, Cooper, to name a few) are very good at remembering regulars and providing great conversation and good communication. And of course, they make awesome coffee.--Overall, ALT is an genuine coffee shop. It does not concern itself with being a coworking space that serves coffee or a faux-vintage caffeine dispenser. They just want to make good coffee. I finally made it (accidentally as the MTA is messed up on weekends and I had missed my gym class) Every time I've tried to drop by, they've been closed due to limited hours.There's a bar seating for three if you want to sip on your espresso beverage but most people seem to grab and go. I ordered a flat white, not on the menu. Not what I expected but still tasted very good. I was actually asked if I liked it strong and how much foam which probably added to the enjoyment of my coffee.I also tried the almond croissant and it was really good. Definitely taste the almond without an insane amount of sugary cream of sorts. The barista (until I know a better name for the people making my coffee) is super friendly with all the customers. Definitely a plus.I love the chill feel of this place. This is one of those places that makes New York great. It's a tiny little coffee cafe that basically takes up the small front part of a design studio (textiles maybe?). The cappuccinos and lattes are great and the service is really friendly. Haven't had any baked goods but plan to next time I'm in town and can stop by! What a gem - so glad we found this place! My coffee was amazing and really smooth and perfectly textured milk. It is VERY hard to find a decent latte here in NYC - trust me. As an Australian tourist I can say we are very very picky with our coffee and only espresso style coffee is the standard - no drip coffee for us anymore. I really enjoyed the coffee and the pumpkin loaf ( which I love and we don't have in Australia - we don't do anything pumpkin sadly) the loaf tasted very fresh and tasty. The shop is so cute and although small feels open and light. The staff are amazing and very friendly - was a delight to meet someone who knew were in Oz we were  from as his g/f is Ozzie too!!Definitely recommend coming here and supporting a great business with greater coffee. Nothing could beat a small cup of latte on a lazy Saturday morning. Little taste is conveniently located in the middle of Chelsea, and has carried a handful of baked goods, including my favorite almond croissants. Cookies were also made hearty and carried an light yet attractive scent. Surprisingly, my latte had a subtle buttery flavor on top of its original creamy taste. Loved every single sip out of it. Great little place to pick up a latte, expresso or specialty coffee.  Delicious selection of baked goods. A very little place. Interesting pastry selection. Good latte, but price is kinda high. There is no seating area, so I just made a quick visit. I was psyched to find this cafe down the street from where we were staying. I had the latte.... and almost went back for another. Easy to miss this little cafe in the floral district. Not the cheapest, but was the best coffee I had all weekend. No seating, you get your drink to go! Five starts to the barista and his piece of artwork Cappuccino.A Little Taste (ALT) is a gem, hiding itself in NYC's flower market on 28th street. Stopping by on a Saturday morning and all the three bar seats had been taken, I decided to wait. The barista checked in with me from time to time and told me I might have to wait for a while. I ordered a cappuccino and an almond croissant once I got the seat. The cappuccino is super fresh because the grinder was just got cleaned up by the barista while I was waiting. The almond croissant, from Colson Bakery in Park Slope, is not the best I ever had, but still good. By the time I finished everything and was about to pay, the barista just gave me an ""everything is on me"" smile.By the way, there is a show room behind ALT, which seems very interesting too. May worth a visit if you stop by on weekdays. Had a great coffee there before an interview-hit the spot!  Seating is limited but service great! Awesome little coffee shop that I stumbled when walking through work in the flower district. Great coffee and great choice of pastries and great service. My husband drug me here from the Waldorf, and all I could think during the trek through throngs if mid-town tourists to get to the 1 train was ""I'm going to kill him, no coffee is worth this!"" Well this coffee is worth it!! By far the best mocha I have ever had!! I plan tongue back again today for a second cup before they close!! Cute tiny coffee place near FIT. Coffee is really good, pastries are decent, and service is quick, but there's not enough space inside to sit and linger. Good for take away quick breakfast. This place is a gem! Sort of hidden but has great coffee and pastries for decent prices. The atmosphere is great and there is a showroom in the back, only problem is only about 3 seats inside so if busy (which it seems to be) then you have to take it on-the-go. Popped in this morning because I ran out of joe at home. Ordered a large drip and a soy latte for my girlfriend. I usually stay away from soy lattes to avoid the blandness (one of my least favorite espresso drink iterations) but I tried a sip of hers and mmmmmaaaan, if you walk by and the super tall guy is working, get espresso. Dude knows how to EXTRACT. Killer milk froth, killer extraction, killer latte art. Their drip is also good, you can tell they put more attention to detail on the batch brew than the average cafe. Cute little cafe hidden in the so called Flower Street. The place is tiny but tastefully decorated. Reminds me of a recent trip to Paris :) especially the baguette  though I have not got a chance to try them. Soy latte is not bad. Will stop by next time I need a coffee break. Overall: best latte I had in NYC so far. I recently became a coffee drinker and I tried some places and they were too sweet for me. This cafe's latte was amazing!Things I liked other than the coffee:- Interior design: petite, rustic, and homey feelThings I thought were meh:- A line outside the store with a wait of about 5-6 min to order, which isn't bad when you have time and considering the coffee taste- Location where if only I'm around 28th St and want coffee I would go (so if you're mostly on 28th St, this aspect wouldn't be a meh for you)- Not a place to hang out. A place to order coffee (and see pillows in the back).- Service where you just order, give money, and get your drink Cute little cafe with many handsome baristas but limited and average-tasting coffee and pastries. Plus, seating is also limited (meaning there are 2 tiny stools). Whoopie pies are okay and chocolate truffle cookie is more of a brownie. Flat white was pretty bitter. I love this tiny and cozy coffee shop. It has its own personality. I had macchiato which was rich and dense. I would definitely come back again even just for a regular coffee. This little shop is adorable and reminds Italy in many ways: coffee is superb and the interior design is warm and fancy. Sweets are excellent, I don't know where they get them from, but they picked the right guy! I had a kind of old-fashioned chocolate fudge and it was amazing.I have to give 3 stars instead of 4 since they served me espresso in plastic/paper cups instead of ceramic (it simply can't happen), plus it's not doable to have a chat inside - place is so small - , so it's not what I'm looking for when I get a coffee with a friend. I'm aware they can improve the first issue while there's not much they can do with the latter.",https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BGpOWdRAuSotK-MNJ5ts-g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZJzfkyww2y_40I83KKJjRA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Jketv1a-mnbFUK6vSCGokg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/o3Qpm0jI-px-rKwiC12Ibw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/m34c9Yri9UfAbx1BIz3WHA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/h6lgVhiKlkfgA2qEY5FolA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oOQubwgm4fkMggyAi9WbDA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UTXwFoe-KOo0SqnBqtbyhQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/f9VVt_9c0t_Brix_IjnKZA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1naD7c2pwrx3_ED4hMYkDA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/195BeUAdNYa1iZHt9etFDg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3zgq4CB_vgHTp0qWxRaNzA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nkzx7KORVa2_kzGHfAeoyw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CoXpyca4tlEtCd6_zxbNew/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zFQitEQCwA0fjN3jscuGhw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/sPnlSiOm6FPErAHI2dRaKA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nzT9gJ6y-kgL9katnBQmxg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bKNxntkvxVIO67jQODyFaQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zWqWWgDiTCydZCyREdmZ0w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ry3KgGrb_pZjHfsDa5441Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/J2ucXA-zUpWNb2pcuFq10A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/p9zjFFPxBg15EWIxzwrQLQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WNlwmdNK9ZQwaRwnA1tjxw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OiQsBQ9uzeMwwGjXauNNLQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/i9sblG28bRaGZSxeY3_jTg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2qdrTT7lgBiI8E0x64mijQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9zgy-fw1q1FzLxpQTl8j6w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MlPFPaA_-sx7T53IM1DKVA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-i99-gk3cwEUNC0dOzW9zg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xn8_c-xonIpAM8JuE5QR6w/258s.jpg
https://www.yelp.com//biz/brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-2,brooklyn-bagel-and-coffee-company-new-york-2,New York,10001,NY,Bagels,Breakfast & Brunch,Cafes,"While the #1, freshest bagel in New York is David's Bagels on 1st Ave. and 15th St., the #2 victory goes to Brooklyn Bagel. Brooklyn sells such delicious, doughy, and tasty sesame bagels. All their bagels are great, but I'm a huge fan of their sesame. They're huge and chewy, and when combined with their fresh lox and onions, it's a feast. Get their delicious hazelnut coffee and - mmmm, divine.5 stars!!!!! Yummmm! I got a plain bagel with cream cheese, and boy was it tasty. The dough was chewy and easy to bite into. The cheese was light - not overly heavy, served as a great balance to the bagel, and complemented the bagel perfectly. I wish I had more time during my stay in NY to come back for a second round and to try the other spreads! I'll be back ;)Only downside: Limited seating to cater to lots of people, so best to only come here for a grab-and-go bagel. Works for me! 5 stars cuz the bagels are good, coffee is good, line goes fast and there are seats and wifi inside. dunno what ppl are complaining bout it's a solid bagel place with a million cream cheese choices in a pretty neighborhood. TWO WORDS: EGG BAGEL.It's devastatingly hard to find egg bagels in the Midwest. In SoCal, it was a little bit easier but still difficult. So, I was super stoked about Brooklyn Bagel's egg bagel offering. Their kettle-boiled bagels are amazing in texture - fluffy and chewy without being rubbery. They come in two sizes - Big &amp; Mini. I wish I just ordered all minis because mini is like the size of a regular bagel. Big is real big - but I'm not complaining about the extra carbs. They also have an incredible variety of cream cheese. I went with a classic - scallion &amp; cream cheese, but the rest looked great as well. I loved it so much that I ordered 13 more to take on the plane with me. I'm also impressed by how quickly they move here. The line wasn't too long, but you can get in and out of there if you're in a pinch!13/365 Come here if you're ready for a good hour or two.  This is not the typical grab and go bagel place.  The line is consistently out the door. We thought ordering online might help with the wait time so we did.  We ordered around 10am and our confirmation indicated a pickup time at 10.48am.  We were there on time, asked for the status with no one really giving us a good answer aside from just yelling the name on the order.  People with pick up time after us got their food.  We finally got our food around 11.15am.  And they were cold.  I really wonder if someone forgot about our bag.I saw people eating their fresh bagel there and they look mighty awesome.  Ours walker cold and not as great anymore.  They do scooped out bagel and dark toast which is the way I like my bagel but to bad it was almost rock solid when I finally ate it. I absolutely love this place! This is our go-to spot at work when it comes to catering breakfast. Brooklyn bagels never disappoints. Their bagels are always fresh, hot, yummy and with all the different and delicious cream cheese, the options are endless.My go to bagel is the egg bagel. Super soft and fresh. Delicious with some freshly made veggie cream cheese! Always in bliss when I chow down on this bagel.Very fast delivery and very amazing and friendly service. Came here around 11am on a Saturday and the line was out the door. Honestly, this was my first time waiting about 30 minutes for a bagel. Luckily, I wasn't disappointed at all. They had so many different bagel choices and spreads. I'm from NJ, so taylor ham and cheese (no, it's not a pork roll) is always my go to. However, I was feeling something sweeter so I decided to go with their coconut bagel with half matcha cream cheese and half cannoli spread. I asked for it half and half, but instead they decided to put the two together. It's a weird combination... but it actually turned out to taste like a green tea frappuccino from starbs, with java chips mixed in. It was actually really good. The matcha was subtle, but noticeable. The cannoli spread wasn't too sweet and it had a good balance of chocolate chips in it. The bagel itself was wonderful, had the perfect chew and a nice outer layer. Probably my new go to bagel place. I adored my onion bagel with scallion cream cheese. The bagel was perfect: lightly toasted, flavorful, chewy, and huge. The cream cheese was creamy and there was plenty of it. I took a bite of my boyfriend's breakfast sandwich, which was also great -- egg was cooked perfectly, and his garlic bagel was addicting. The price is a little high, but in-line with what I've come to expect from New York City. And it's totally worth it. The place obviously gets quite crowded, with a line out the door. I would advise doing your best to know what you want before reaching the counter. The staff is mostly nice enough but not very patient if you stumble through your order. They are great at remembering your order, though! I rattled off a somewhat complex order and the guy memorized it perfectly and my food was entirely correct. The line was nearly to the door with an approximate 15 minute wait which was expected for a mid Saturday morning. We got an everything bagel with garlic and herb cheese. There was a bit too much garlic unless you like a bite every bite. I will say, I would go again but this time try another cream cheese flavor since there was a multitude of other interesting flavors to try.I did snag a photo of what appeared to be chicken directly below the cream cheese that I don't know how to describe except for not something I want to eat. Would go back just that weird chicken business is the reason for the lower rating. Waited on line for like 20 minutes and then had to leave!Brooklyn Bagel I'll be back!! Not embarrassed to admit that I was in NYC for a conference and I came here every single day! It was THAT good.The line was long on Saturday, but they had plenty of people working and organized well enough that it went by super fast! During the week around 8am there was hardly a line to my surprise! Sausage egg and cheese on a plain bagel - 5 starsPlain bagel with bacon and scalion cream cheese - 5 starsEverything bagel with plain cream cheese - 5 stars!Everything was great, the service is great and they keep everything clean and well stocked. I even stopped on my way to Penn Station to get a dozen bagels to bring home! Solid bagel place in NY! I don't think you can go wrong with bagels and cream cheese anywhere but NY does it best of course. My friends and I got here around 9am and the line was pretty substantial but moved pretty fast. I don't know if it was just me but the menu wasn't very clear if you wanted a regular bagel with toppings, but it did show that they offered a wide array of sandwiches and other breakfast items. Someone correct me if I'm wrong cause I might've missed it but I didn't see a list of cream cheese or other toppings available. Since they want you to order pretty speedily to keep the line going, I definitely felt rushed lol I only knew what kind of schmears they had until I reached the deli case. Luckily, I saw that they had lox and cream cheese so I was good hahaThey had so many bagel options. I ended up with a whole wheat bagel with the topping was like $5~ and with a coffee, my total came out to like 7 bucks. I halfed my bagel with my friend because I learned my lesson from my last NY trip LOL they don't play with bagel portions. A half was the perfect amount for me for breakfast and I usually require a bit to get full. So if you have someone to split it with, it wouldn't be a bad idea if you aren't famished. There's maybe 4-5 tables and a bar area with stools but I'm assuming most people take these babies to-go. Wish l looked it up earlier but it turns out they have online ordering so that would've been convenient lol. There's an area clearly marked for you to pick it up if you do choose method. Definitely do this if you wanna skip the line! The best and freshest bagels can be found here. The bagel sandwiches are all terrific with the ability to customize to any taste. The coffee is even good too. The bagels here are pretty good, but also very pricey. They have a huge selection of bagels and spreads, which makes for endless combinations. It was pretty crowded when I popped in around 9:00 a.m., but the line moved fairly quickly. They have a small seating area with tables, and I was able to snag a seat for one. I ordered a poppy seed bagel with scallion schmear and lox, which was $13. I definitely was not expecting it to be that expensive, but portion size was huge, so that made up for some of the high price. While the bagel was tasty, it definitely wasn't the best bagel I've had. You'd likely be able to find better, cheaper bagels elsewhere, but this place is still a solid bet and worth checking out. Went into the city for a Broadway show with my mom and sister and I wanted to find a place near Penn Station-ish that wasn't too far out of where we were headed. Founds this lil spot on Yelp and holy crap--it held up to it's reviews.  We got there and the line was out the door. I don't know about you but I'm the type of person that is always happy to see this because I immediately know we picked the right spot. All three of us got everything bagels with different types of cream cheese (they have tons of tofu cream cheese options for all those non-dairy people like me!!). The bagels were huge, crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, excessive seeds and overall the total NYC bagel experience. I can't stop thinking about these friggin bagels! PROS- Vegan cream cheese options! - Cream cheese flavors were creative and fun (matcha was the flavor of the week!) - Staff was v friendly and cheerful--sometimes harder to come across in a busy bagel shop like this one- Central location, close to Penn Station- Line moved quickly- V affordable- Bagels were perf! I'll be back in the city in a couple days and tbh I'm probably coming right back here. It was THAT good. Yep, five stars. As bagel shops go, this is as good as it gets. In just over a week, I tried the same bagel (toasted everything with cream cheese and tomato) at five different places and decided that this place had the best. Once the decision was made about the best place (I was on a mission to eat a bagel for breakfast every day while I was back in town) I got adventurous with my bagel order. I tried their pickle cream cheese (not bad), their low fat cream cheese, and...their pumpernickel everything bagel is awesome! The bagels are made right there, the place is clean, the choices are many, the line moves quickly, my orders always came out correctly, and the cashiers were pleasant. What more can you ask for? Well, perhaps good coffee. To be fair, I didn't try their coffee because the walk to get the bagel was fairly long and I passed several Starbucks along the way. By the time I got my bagel, the sugar in my coffee was dissolved and it had cooled off enough to drink. Morning perfection. Darn good bagels. I would know because I bought 28 of them, and lugged all 28 of them across Chelsea on foot in order to get them on my bus back to Boston. I sacrificed precious leg room for the two giant brown bags (and I mean giant. These bagels are huge), and don't regret a second of it. Every drop of sweat and every ache in my back was worth it because my freezer is now stocked full of these delicious rings of dough. Next time, I'm coming for you smears. And I can't wait. After moving out of the city for a year and a half, I have spent too many mornings daydreaming about NYC bagels while eating a toasted artificially flavored pumpkin spice grocery store bagel topped with 35% vegetable oil spread. I finally had the chance to be in NYC and had only 2 hours of free time in Gramercy. The New York City bagel, so elusive in any other part of the world, was my first big task in the city. I deprived myself from 2 hours of sleep the prior night Yelping for the best bagel within walking distance. The mini bagels were the ultimate selling point for me to choose Brooklyn Bagel &amp; Coffee Company over Ess-a-bagel, Thompson Square, Zuckers, etc.I ordered an untoasted mini whole wheat with lox and full fat scallion cream cheese (cuz who would get reduced fat cream cheese? This isn't Halo Top, you don't get to have a low cal version if you're eating a New York bagel because that would defeat the purpose). I also ordered a spelt bagel, which only comes in the full size and it weighted as much as a 6 pack of my pumpkin spice artificially flavored bagels from the grocery store. You know those rare moments when you eat food so good that nothing else really matters because you are absolutely present in the moment, in touch with all your senses? The swirled patterns of the dough, the chewy and dense texture, the generous amount of lox, the heaviness of the cream cheese... I wish I had gotten the regular instead of the mini. The mini was definitely enough food and satiating, but I never experienced diminishing marginal returns. Each bite was just as good, if not better than the previous and left me wishing I had more after I finished. The spelt bagel was just 'ight. It was pretty dry, and I ended up throwing most of it away because it sent my luggage over the weight limit. Love the pumpernickel everything bagel! So good. Had it with the standard Nova Scotia salmon and cream cheese. It was as enjoyable as bagels get for lack of better terms haha. They definitely put a more than adequate amount of lox in the bagel which is a major plus since lox in any bagel leads it to be over $10. If you're big on cream cheese, there is a plethora of options here. Enjoy! So many choices for cream cheese. My wife got the loxs and bagel sandwich was amazing, I got the the eggs and bacon breakfast sandwich on an everything bagel. It all tasted amazing. I would go there again next time I'm In the area",https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gMF8xnz61ac8ZsNHlNk9Bw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zimyW2ACQlgSXvJuFM-46w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xK1JqRsBUtdcmw4fVdby4w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mN2D7SSopfiYPnCLNzpLdg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/sFmh5vSzGK02eP21nsNrzg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JkEwAgnB7aJF2fEslRC7Xw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Yk8q50JnJTQtV_Xnt3ONNg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dLC5UM64FRMHuHFf6RTQ1Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oxH3BmnznoYAO8DrOtyp-Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/woY-LwTxpn0Otq6PJHsslQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NhSTxyQTFRyMu49e_hHvPQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_cV32VAxq7Sgoyj3iemBKw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6Y0onLuGVMjCio6xNAoIAg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5KakRNocCwyMMMp187G0jw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EahsLh_3ncaPepNlhpVe1g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2mxhRoKEL8hnbm9OgtTblA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dpi7jS_icRicfH6JnNbGuQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/98VCOF98iXlhtM_St2jdCw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-eZ3L4VDVlWWfeXAq2Bx6w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-chuYTe0qv_GEFZQDDVkKw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0GszA52hDdDyS2pDgzfkig/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8nbL93eP38_PajCQgDvfrA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/unqFQqTcsLJK8HMKg4Wi_Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/R3kepm76cqqk61KjqO_9Vw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GyZ3OoMnSUMqcUyVsrXSjw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wWixxuwOVAIPW6_hZGKEdg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/73pQtlrIMhbTL8nybiVxpg/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA

Very rich in flavor, tastes like coffee and isn't watered down by the soy milk. Fresh of course. Also got the iced coffee with soy as well and gotta say, not disappoint at all, great coffee flavor, not watered down again, even though it's iced! Must try when in the area if you're a big coffee fan! My girlfriend found this place and recommended we go here and study. This place is excellent local shop. They make a good cup of coffee and the space is also very clean. Very family friendly. If you are looking for a place to do work, look no further. They have about 6 tables for people to seat. I really like the vibe and energy of the place. We were there for about 2 hours and the place looked really popular on a Saturday. There were tons of people walking in and out getting coffee. They have another location in Chinatown which I have not been to. This afternoon I wish to come here with my best friend to drink a special, yes an excellent cappuccino, so nice presented, and have a chat over many news and things,, and enjoy the special moment. Whenever I am near chinatown and need a coffee fix this is my go to. The staff are cool and the coffee is great. This is definitely a good place for studying or just a little coffee shop for you to catch up with your friends at. There is free wifi for those who bring in their laptops. The trash area and the self pour sugar and creamer area is super clean ! Fabulous service today. Friendly, prompt and inviting just as they've typically been. Glad that today's service is a better reflection of the business as compared to a previous experience. It was a slow morning so I decided to go on a caffeine adventure-aka find a new cafe.After walking around Chinatown on such a gray morning, this place felt like a refuge.There was quiet music playing, the lighting was still dim as it was early, and the two relaxed guys behind the counter were joking quietly with a costumer.I ordered a soy matcha latte and a blueberry pumpkin muffin. Both were solid and satisfying. Lots of space to work, not sure about wifi.Decor was interesting, lots of wood and coffee memorabilia, without being overwhelming. Really did feel like I was stepping out of the city for a few minutes.Will be back, although I wish they'd had more food options besides pastries. I love 12 corners on mott &amp; I'm so happy they have this bigger location , my go tos are the matcha latte, americano and in the fall they have a delicious pumpkin latte. Free WiFi, &amp; a few bookshelves filled with books for you to browse. So worth the trip! I came in on a rainy day after reading the Yelp reviews, and opted to try the pumpkin latte. I have to admit the Instagram photos also attracted me - and didn't disappoint! The pumpkin latte was better than anything at Starbucks, and definitely less expensive. While I did not finish it all, it hit the spot on a cold day. This place is about a mile from my apartment &amp; the walk is not bad at all so I will definitely be back. The gentleman behind the counter even went so far as to ensure my latte art was perfect after I requested a particular design. I appreciated the mellow vibe &amp; quick customer service! I stumbled upon this coffeeshop because it's downstairs of my brother's apartment building (had dinner plans later that night) and wow, I am SO jealous. My favorite cafes to date have been Cafe Jax (UES) and Grace Street (Koreatown, no wifi), but I think 12 Corners might've actually stolen the spot for #1 with its great customer service, free &amp; reliable wifi, available outlets, fantastic ambiance for studying, good hours, accessible and cute bathroom, solid drinks &amp; pastries, and comfortable seating. I was pretty much there from 8:30am-7pm yesterday (got a late start to the day but I LOVE that it's open at 7:30) and it was pretty cool to see the staff's interactions with repeat customers. They seem like good people. :) They're also really nice about letting people use the bathroom; when I ran in from the rain after my lunch break and stared at the menu, they asked if I needed the bathroom (even though I hadn't ordered anything!) How nice. :) Speaking of the bathroom, it has some cute decoration. Check it out :p Although I really love Cafe Jax &amp; Grace Street, I realized when I sat here that there's a HUGE difference for my back when I can lean against a straight, comfortable back. Most cafes will have chairs or benches, but they don't compare to 12 Corners' seating. I don't actually know what it's called (the bench is attached to the wall? and there's a cushiony back), but I loved it. I was actually super comfortable studying the whole day and I was so sad when the staff kindly came around telling us that the cafe was closing in 5 minutes. :( 12 Corners doesn't serve actual food, but it is located conveniently in Chinatown, so you can totally just grab cheap &amp; tasty food nearby. Yesssss. I think I'd go to Lam Zhou noodles (less than a minute away) when I study here again. (: As for the actual drinks - I actually just got a jasmine tea (very fragrant and floral, yay), but my friend got an autumn spice latte and I thought it was really good. (And I usually don't even drink coffee!) Definitely interested in trying out their other drinks. I got a toasted ham &amp; cheese croissant in the morning (very tasty and flaky, yum) and a cranberry rhubarb bran muffin in the afternoon (very healthy tasting! I approve :D). Can't wait to try some of their other drinks :) Everything is pretty reasonably priced - and there's Belly! Overall, I really like 12 Corners (and that it's literally right by my brother's apt, so I can hang out with him afterwards). Definitely going to come back! Just beyond the trendy restaurants and bars on south Orchard lives 12 Corners, a humble and inviting coffee shop that serves a very good cup of joe. It turns out they have been in the area since summer of 2012, before the Lower East Side turned into one big coffee spill. I stumbled upon 12 Corners using the Cups app when my normal LES go-to was closed for the day. For $3.60 (Cups discount), you can get a mean latte...strong and smooth and created with great attention to detail. Considering I am super picky and found myself super satisfied with the taste I did some research of their supplier, Kobrick. Kobrick is a family-owned business that has been around for 4 generations and takes great pride in their process. Their site is a great resource for knowledge and home brewing techniques and they've easily made their way into my top 5 beans in the city. When it comes to 12 Corners' service, it's lightning fast and very friendly. I will definitely be returning as much as possible and will now blindly trust their Mott Street location for an incredible cappuccino. It's a nice sitting environment to chat with friends over a cup of coffee or to read/study. A lot of the people there were sitting with their notes, laptop or books with a drink. I came with two friends, wanting to find a good place to sit and possibly study or just chat. The other 12 corners location is really small and we decided to walk the extra distance in the rain to this one. Luckily there were seats. I ordered an Iced Green Tea Latte, one of my friends ordered a hot Green Tea Latte, and another friend ordered a Hot Black Coffee. I really liked my latte, no sugar was added, all matcha taste. However my friends and I were wondering why they served my friends' hot drinks in to-go cups where everyone sitting down had their cafe cups/mugs. There was a big bookshelf behind where we sat. So if anyone wants to order a drink and just read but forgot a book, here's the place. There's a bathroom, just have to ask for the key if it's not right there on the counter. There's a big mirror inside the bathroom, I scared myself when I turned the lights on and closed the door, thinking someone was standing there (it was just myself). My friends and I ended up sitting there for a good 3-4 hours. I'll definitely come back when I decide to study and/or want to relax and read a book with some coffee. This cafe has a cozy, welcoming atmosphere. It's relatively quiet, making it a good spot to study or do some work. The outlets on the wall allow you to charge your devices, and Wifi is provided. Although most of the seats were occupied when I visited, it didn't feel busy or crowded at all. The staff were friendly and made my drink quickly.I ordered an iced green tea latte, and I can't say that I enjoyed it much. It tasted very milky and lacked the matcha flavor that the hot version has. The latte is unsweetened, and you can add sugar or syrup to adjust the sweetness to your liking. However, this didn't help diminish the powdery, milky taste.Overall, this is a nice place to stop by if you need to use the restroom or the Wifi, but the green tea latte leaves something to be desired. Perhaps the coffee is better? I like that they're open really early in the morning. They didn't have cold brew so I ordered an ice coffee which is pretty decent. The staff is nice and service is good. Location is a bit small with a few tables only but the overall decor and vibe is very cozy. This is close to home for me as well, so I will be back. Next time, I'll try the other selections. Stopped by on a chilly Saturday morning this month and was really pleased with this find! The place is pretty small and I was lucky enough to grab the last table around 11AM. I got an iced coffee which was pretty good, and sat down to do some studying. It seemed that most people who were lucky enough to get a table stayed for a few hours, so getting a seat might be tricky! With that said, I enjoyed doing homework here. Overall noise level is pleasant, where you can chat quietly with your friends and also get some work done. I will be back! I came in on a Saturday afternoon and was still able to find a table/seat!I got the green tea latte with almond milk. I wish they carried coconut milk or Lactaid here, because I don't really like almond or soy milk much, which were the only lactose-free options they had. I could taste the matcha in my latte, which is awesome! Only thing is the almond milk didn't really go so well with it. It was my first time mixing those two, so lesson learned. However, given the choice between almond milk and soy milk, I think I'll try the coffee next time instead. I stayed for about 3 hours to do some studying. Great environment. The music playing was not too loud, but still audible. My drink lasted me the full 3 hours so that's always a plus.Will be back! I wish they carried some savory options for food though :( LOVE this spot now - it's become my go-to spot for studying! The space is comfy and the staff is super nice and accommodating to every customer (my observation). I come here often because I live close by, which is convenient. The drinks are also top notch  and they have a good selection of pastries! I usually get a flat white (stronger than other coffee shops I've tried) with the occasional shake up in drink - I've tried the chai latte (yummy) and the matcha latte (unsweetened and yummy also). This place is great. $2.50 coffee with one free warm-up. Delicious, fresh pastries, though I doubt they're made on site. I went with the dark cherry Danish. Try that. Free wi-fi. Complimentary ice water. Friendly staff. And a bathroom. What more could you ask for in New York?There was some construction going on out front when I went here in October 2015, so for the time being, this may not be the most conducive coffee shop for studying if that's your goal. Great spot, nice, humbling and tranquil. Enjoy having my breakfast there when I can. Customer service is good, coffee is awesome, spacious, outlets everywhere to charge your device, price is fine and is better then most coffee shop around NYC. Highly Recommended!!!  Just read the reviews if you don't believe in it. This is by far my favorite coffee shop in the city. I've been coming here every day for many years and have never, not once, had a bad experience. The staff is so friendly, attentive, and diligent - you can tell they really care about their customers. Since I'm a regular, they know what I like and often get it started as soon as I walk in the door. I've seen them do this with many other regular customers as well. And the coffee is truly the best coffee I've had in NYC - I drink the espresso exclusively (I'm pretty sure they brew Kobrick beans), and the way they do their americanos is superior to pretty much all others I've had. The coffee shop itself has a great vibe, it's comfortable with a decent amount of tables and not overly trendy or corporate. There's a bathroom and free wifi for customers. They usually have a small-ish selection of muffins, croissants, and other pastries that always look really good and fresh, though I've admittedly never had one... they also have a selection of teas and do matcha drinks and other specialty lattes.I happen to live in the neighborhood so coming here everyday is a no-brainer. But if you like great coffee and appreciate top-notch service, this place is worth the trek. Location: I become more familiar with  LES. Lol, my pre work out or post work out place.  12 corner is definitely worth to try - their coffee bean is different from all other places in Manhattan and they do play attention how they brew coffeeCoffee: ice coffee is delicious. ( they sold out their cold brew....)Price: cheapService: nice especially with free wifi.",https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZGPCUUViDTKmHtcAbsQAXg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6R-KVduzMfz8IMfTwfSdvQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VM4VSM2yIaPdPZcaPQZR5w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/aJhd2AEtMuVaKfyLtVU27A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MMuTqHdIOOHAUVMVUPC3HA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Y63Y6VdSsCW_se0Z7_fMfg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/62GOUDyrzxnlVBP44GHVAg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VPBL8fFpr3yfkbB7qpm03g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9da33KP8kUrpDRA2y273BQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AbK4SLtY0S9WRQ4r5dQdsg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/m07qJW-MsMzs0jWY3Em05w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5febWzNiIhtBe-XmHxVIJA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BZdHOn7rA7VDulm-o09fcg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hfSGKgY_IS4-FL-n5N1_0w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Ti2sexKi25fh2XSts9dADQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zb78lTj52RybTGbcMqcX_A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qSTKL8ymumhtBthqUkf4sQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cb-TubKMxfokzVx_R8upBA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/63N4Tinra8wS1OfWLrXPaw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dLpphqZgk8UevgQV0DV2uA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vUF9-1UtI6VRKEC4XPwIdw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TuVSxA4MFoy8FaOIonrrPw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4V39we7RLmkZe8ADSZZ0fg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2kvUDywlhE2gG7J1wVuZlg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_gdE70LuQ7kDNeZPS_mWlQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yjXShbFQ73DGMlOHi5SWrA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0uDFzZsQ8EfwNdDnOCNB_w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/E_DUN6_x33sj5AsQFE65AA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Gd6fgjrS-JsEiELr54FC8g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xOE9xEUfAmYPOtfITNZ24g/258s.jpg
https://www.yelp.com//biz/99-favor-taste-new-york-12,99-favor-taste-new-york-12,New York,10002,NY,Hot Pot,Barbeque,Asian Fusion,"Came here with high expectation and was expectations were definitely met!Great variety at the sauce barGreat variety of meat and vegetablesDid not try the hot pot we came for the bbqBut definitely would come just for the hotpot I has 6 pm reservation. My party arrived before 6 but they had no table. We waited 10-15 minutes before a girl with a clipboard came out to the waiting area and started calling names, not mine.  I told her I had a 6 pm reservation and has been waiting. She looked perplexed. I looked at her clipboard and pointed my out my name to her. I was supposed to be next.  She seems surprised to see my name on the list.  She told me to wait a minute.  Even seeing my name on the list, she needed a minute to think about this really really difficult situation.  She came to fetch us and brought us to a table.  No one came to talk our order for another ~10 minutes.  After ordering.m the floor manager came by to tell us we have 2 hours to eat. I asked her ""from now?""  Her reply ""from the time of your reservation"". Did I let her have it!!!  I told her I was there before my reservation.  They had no table and made us wait.   We also did not receive any service after we sat down.   We had just placed our hour so the 2 hours should start now. She also had that perplexed look as the girl before.   She said she'll check and see.  She never came back at 8 to kick us out. If she had, I would have made sure she get a piece if my mind. They never apologized for making us wait for a table. The floor manager, hearing that we did not get service for a while, did not apologize either or told us our time starts then. I used to love coming here. They just reminded me why I haven't for a long time.  There are now so many hotpot place around. I'll definitely give my business to another establishment. p.s.  the House herbal tea was so diluted it tasted more like water than tea. OH-EM-GEE!I'm usually not this dramatic but this all you can eat (Yes, i said all you can eat..can i get an amen?) hot pot spot is worth the wait! And if you don't have a reservation, there is a considerable wait.Found this place through yelp (thanks yelpers) and decided to check it out. As you walk up to the restaurant you can smell the delicious goodness awaiting inside! We figured the wait would be maybe an hour right? Wrong! it was 2.5 hrs! Put our names down and sure enough we get a call back in 2 hrs (ye we waited - we really wanted to try this spot ok). The menu - They have a wide spread of what you can choose from. From meats to veggies - they have you covered. They even had Fish roe balls on the All You Can Eat menu (one of my faves - def check it out)!!!Can we talk about their sauce station? They have a sauce station with every possible sauce, topping you would need for your meal! I'm talking, sriracha, chili paste, their homemade sauce (which is worth the extra cents!), peanut, sesame, garlic...i really could go on here. Needless to say we were STUFFED! (I may have had a friend roll me out)If you check in on yelp - you get a free icecream. Its nothing fancy but hey its F-R-E-E and I needed the cold cream (too much hot sauce!).Also - the table behind us was doing all you can eat BBQ which also looked so scrumptious!Oh thing that I can see people getting annoyed about is that if there is a birthday being celebrated (which I believe there were at least 8 when we were dining), they play this loud bday song and have this guy dressed up as a monkey dance about. I mean...sure it was a spectacle but embrace it y'all. Just embrace it. All in all - I definitely will return to this spot if I'm back in NYC. I love this place- wonderful service, great, plentiful/unlimited/fresh food! Sauce bar; dessert... reservations!They also offer aprons and a bag to put your things in! Make sure you go before 6:00 PM or the line will be SUPER LONG. I had the all-you-can-est hot pot and it was satisfying. The broth isn't pre-seasoned with much flavor, therefore you must go to the self-seasoning bar to collect your own spices. This allows you to have your own agency to make your broth and food spicy, sweet, or etc. You have fish fillet, mussels, crab, fishballs, spinach, and many more foods. *if it's your birthday, they have a super cute birthday celebrate song and mention they create for you--it actually has to be your birthday though* 99 Favor Taste is great! They offer AYCE hotpot, BBQ, good service, and make-your-own sauce station. The food is good and plentiful.They also give you free meal for someone's birthday (with proof) and presently- plastic bags for your coats to avoid your coats smelling like hot pot. The restaurant is large, with a second floor for big parties. I've been here multiple times: for birthday parties and casual lunches/dinners. Its very affordable, and you are guaranteed to leave very full! We definitely tend to overeat when it's a paid set price ($21). Be careful ordering because if you have leftovers, they reserve a right to charge you more. The food quality varies but usually the shrimp, squid, tofu, vegetables are very fresh. I like the Japanese pumpkin and noodles for the end of the meal, to absorb the delicious broth. The beef and lamb rolls are pretty good but the beef balls are usually frozen. The chicken is fatty and comes in huge chunks, I would avoid this order. I will definitely be back! I've only ever been to their Flushing restaurant before but I definitely prefer this location more! This one just seems more spacious and cleaner for some reason. However, that may also be because we went around 3 PM on a weekday. Even during such an off hour there was still a good amount of people in the restaurant feasting. We came in as a group of five and were seated right away. When you enter you choose whether you want the all you can eat bbq, hot pot or both. And then you pick all of the items you want from a menu and they bring it out. You don't have to order everything right away you can order after as well and they bring out the food fairly quickly. We had no time limit since it was not during the main dinner time therefore we were able to stay in the restaurant for around 3 hours to slowly eat and enjoy our bountiful feast. Additionally, make sure to check in on either here or Facebook because you can receive a free scoop of ice cream which is a great ending to a filling meal! 99 Flavors is great for large groups to celebrate birthdays and special occasions. The meat, veggies, and seafood quality is average and may take some time to come out especially on busy days. Since our party was 15 people, we tried to order many beef dishes at once, but were served only one at a time. Perhaps it may have been to prevent waste, but with a group as large as ours, we cleared the meat in less than a minute and had to wait 5 - 10 minutes for the next tray. Nevertheless, we were all stuffed in the end. The experience lived up to the name! The service was very fast and efficient. I was very surprised for a gigantic hot-pot place. The sauce bar could be improved and monitored for spills more frequently. I thought they had a great selection for all you can eat. Of course, the meat selection will not be as premium as a non-AYCE places go. Beers and alcohol were cheap, making it a great place for friends get-togethers. There's also a birthday special where the birthday person gets to eat for free. Came here for the first time and my experience is wasn't as great as I thought it would be.  I was a part of a larger party and the server was so rude to us.  I know that there is a language barrier but the eye rolling and lack of trying to understand us came off as super condescending.  When we asked for more vegetables, fish or meat we received an attitude.  When it was time for the bill to come the waitress told us that we would receive a discount if we all paid cash but this wasn't the case.  She divided our party into two separate checks and honored the cash discount to only half of our party.  It was trouble just asking for a paper check because she gave us a hard time when we asked for a printed receipt (probably because the incorrect break down was exposed). On to the food - everything was fresh and great and have no complaints.  The silverware that is located near the sauces was all dirty and if it wasn't dirty then it looked dirty because of the finger prints and dishwasher stains. The table was too small for our party of 10 and  even with a reservation we were squeezed in a high traffic area that we could not fit.Overall the employees ruined this place for me.  I wont be back. I crave hotpots now and then and decided to come here one cold Friday night to cater to my cravings. Asked how long the wait was and they said 3 hours. Yes, 3 hours!  Made a reservation for another Friday evening. This time the wait was 30 mins. Yes! We had a wait despite the reservation. Once seated, you are handed a wet napkin, a hairband and plastic bags to place your jackets in to avoid the lingering sichuan smell. They also provide ziplocks for your phones on request.""All you can eat hot pot for $22.99"" is popular here. Pick your soup base from original, chinese herbal, spicy, pig bone, curry, tomato, kimchi, mix mushroom. Unlike other hotpot places where you have a single pot with a divider placed in the center of the table, each seat gets a small pot and is placed on your very own mini stove. We ordered 1 spicy and 1 original broth. While the spicy broth needs no change, you can experiment with the flavor of original broth by adding additional (around 20) sauces. I personally loved the spicy broth as the spice was flavorsome and not over-the-top. Pick the add-ons from a plethora of veg and non-veg options and devour the spread. Highlights:* Make a reservation* Get the all-you-can-eat hot pot for $22.99* Get the spicy broth or experiment with original broth* Free meal on your birthday. You've got to show your ID.* Birthday +-3 days also gets you a free meal if you or your friends get an 8"" cake.* If you get a cake, you get a minute to fame with a cosplaying, dancing monkey who sings for you. They also take your picture and print it for you as a souvenir. It's as embarrassing as it sounds.* Yelp checkin gives you a free scoop of icecream. No one-per-table rule. I wish I had photos of the cooked food but unfortunately it's all in my stomach. Too busy going in. We got the all you can eat hot pot and bbq. My boyfriend got the pork bone and I got the original. The original tastes more flavorful if it season it yourself some more with ingredients from the ingredients bar. I really liked the pork broth a lot better. The big squid was a winner for me along with everything else honestly. It depends on everyone's individual preference. There's a huge variety of meats to pick from so can't go wrong here I love AYCE hot pot, and I have a good time here every time I visit. For $24 you get a decent variety of meat, vegetables, and fish, AND you get a free meal on your birthday (or within the three days before or after)! We had reservations for 2 at 1pm on a Sunday. Always make a reservation if possible because this place fills up like you wouldn't believe. We originally wanted to come for dinner on Saturday evening, but the wait for 3 people was about 2.5 hours, and tables were reserved until literally 11pm. Make a reservation!Beyond that, I don't really have any helpful tips or advice. This restaurant is delicious and service is usually fine. You tell them what broth and items you want (get the pork bone broth) and they bring it to you. When you want more stuff, you let them know. Simple as that. You also get a scoop of ice cream at the end of your visit, so look forward to that! Hotpot is my thing. I absolutely love all things hotpot and try to eat at as many hotpot restaurants as I get a chance to try. I love all styles of hotpot -- Japanese, Korean, Chinese... if it's hotpot, chances are I'll love it.That being said, 99 Flavor Taste has been one of the best hotpot places I've ever ate at.Reservations are definitely recommended. They are a big birthday place, and if you come here on your birthday, you'll get a free hotpot for one person and a guy in a dancing bear costume singing happy birthday to you. While I am not usually a fan of those kind of theatrics, this place is so over the top that it actually becomes fun.You can get a hotpot with either two or three (the Benz) flavor broths. Since more is better, we opted for the Benz and got Chinese herbal, curry, and spicy. All three flavors were amazing! My favorite was the Chinese herbal blend; I was surprised how much I loved it, but to this day I crave it and will definitely be back for it, birthday or not!The choices of what you can add to your hotpot are incredibly varied, in meats, fish, and vegetables, and the all you can eat price is reasonable. The service is friendly and helpful.99 Flavor Taste is literally everything you can ask out of a hotpot place. Highly, highly recommended! This was my first time trying hot pot and it was a lot of fun! I made a res for around 4 pm on a weekday before a holiday, but typically there's a monster wait to get in here. Service was okay. I guess my main complaint is that the food wasn't super flavorful, but cooking it was fun and the experience was good overall. 3.5 stars. Reasonable prices (figure in taxes and tips), all you can eat, unlimited refills (we didn't ask for refills for after the unenforced 2-hour limit), birthday meal free!Don't be shy in asking for refills. It takes time for the food to prepare the food, so don't waste time waiting for the waiting staff, who are accommodating but may miss a dish or two.Get an earlier reservation so you have a chance at a bigger, more private table. I don't understand all the hoopla about smells seeping into clothing.Service was courteous and prompt. Just a couple of blocks from the Grand St. subway station. Grab a free ice cream on the way out. 99 Favor is one of my favorite hot pot restaurants. I've been many times with big groups of friends. The meat selection is diverse and high quality; ranging from beef, lamb, and pork to crab, squid, and quail egg. The veggie selection is equally as impressive. There is bound to be something you like at 99 Favor. There is also a wide range of hot pot broths you can choose. My favorite broth is the pig bone broth but the original and spicy broths are also great. There's a dizzying array of condiments to create your perfect hot pot dipping sauce as well. If hot pot isn't your thing, there's also Korean BBQ which you can pair with your hot pot. Your meal is also free on your birthday which is great. This is an excellent value.  Their seafood choice of crabs and shrimp were excellent.  The array of vegetables is good and the sauces for you to mix was excellent.  What a good value! No was surprised to get in for lunch yesterday!The table I sat in (communal table) seats 6 and had 6 individual burner imbedded in the table.  Each person can sanitarily use a pot for yourself.It has about 5 or 6 soups to choose from.  You can have all fish or mixture of fish and meat shabu  shabu  style cooking or hot pot cooking. You can also opt in to have hot pot PLUS grilled food for a slightly higher price.Here's another place I will consider to go back to. I came here with my husband and my friend and it is a perfect place for a cold winter day. All the ingredients were fresh and even though I stuffed my face, my stomach didn't feel too terrible. I especially liked the beef and all the vegetables. The place was very spacious with sensible interior. We only had hot pot and not the barbecue but barbecue seemed delicious as well. I will say this is not a bad option when you crave Chinese hot pot. This was my first hot pot experience and it was absolutely delicious. We had the Korean BBQ and hot pot option. It was worth the extra money and a nice break to be able to switch back and forth. I enjoyed everything except for the pig brain. No mater how long it cooked it was just squishy brain. The crab was hard to handle too. Shrimp, lamb and beef tongue were superb. They have a huge sauce selection and they were very prompt on the service. I never felt rushed at all and left incredibly satisfied. Hint: be careful about ordering too much food because they ""can"" charge you for the extra waste by the pound. It wasn't a problem for us but it might be if your eyes are bigger than your stomach. Enjoy!",https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CBmeVyav6YNTLBIxNv2L0Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HGe8EnkJGLgxaJ4EenZeGw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QaPmundDwKr5YdmOrpLCtQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FCr6m8DP7xblhEYB9fmCLg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UYVR_rWRagV3GSoSVREjHg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yg6XKulRtrjyBppSWzLI0A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WjgmGMq4xeWc0lrpewNWlQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1wuQTgVhad3wsEYpl56OYQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cMZSmjJAG87cTifwmaq-SQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kpnIARC-pNSQdmC4pCf-hw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/J5QJzUweKvx_cjKXxN22lQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/upd9yl_LC-IhclwJryiXcg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_wSBgZ-AMgDLTlWvri3Bqw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oXveRlElr4HEJp5_vK_BuA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PGcXCLyKF6d59miITcvPMA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fgPFyargaK_7SF8xjZ1hcg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LjHedrC76omlL3UWDFh08w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/H1lxcDwyNmqBzw4tpAXPiA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AlQ2s3nlTllSGW6QlwMPIg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tPMcGqNTSNBUiAaY_pgfbQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/siiK4hhLfjcbcu4IPKjZbw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vIGYH3UYYt0LMspQkaJHvw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/e30R60mghjd27VUVHiPaag/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hfql8nzQhvbmj3w_1T6Yvw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zh-g9kpweJMqR5a1UWkEIQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pzq5fWsIZqZZDQanGaTV_A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/o1DbqWEwdSPXY2fuuwz9rQ/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/apoth%C3%A9ke-new-york-2,apoth%C3%A9ke-new-york-2,New York,10002,NY,Lounges,Cocktail Bars,Mexican,"I've wanted to go this cocktail bar for a couple of years now. I dare you to find another establishment that pays as much attention to detail then this place. I was very impressed with every element. I was slightly disappointed when I didn't see the lab coats. I'm not sure how long ago they stopped doing that. It's in an odd location right in the heart of china town with a discreet entrance. In the evening this particular street is deserted, so it adds to the mystique. I like the space, with enough seating in the lounge area for smallish parties and plenty of room at the bar. The bar starts to come alive later in the evening, but even with more people it never felt too crowded or loud.  I love the cocktail list. Be prepared to pay $18, which is more or less standard for an upscale cocktail bar or speakeasy.  I will definitely return. I wouldn't consider this a ""speakeasy"" but it has some pretty great drinks. The vibe is perfect in the early evening with plenty of room to sit and enjoy the barea (bar area... I just came up with that) *self-five*They also have limited lounge seating for groups and couples to enjoy. Perfect after dinner stop, but beware it does get packed later in the night. A cute little bar if you're into the following: 1. Hidden and discrete like a speakeasy in an old alley in Chinatown2. Kitschy in concept trying to emulate an apothecary in their decor and bartender uniforms3. Young and into the standing around a bar with little to no seating, hot, and crowded bar sceneThey have tasty drinks all made in front of your eyes, a little heavy on the wallet, but that's fairly standard NYC pricing and there isn't a long wait. What made my experience more fun was seeing Buzzfeed Worthit's Steven Lim at the bar with a friend. So I guess even media personalities find it worth it! Five stars for the best cocktail in NYC, one that I had six years ago and had been talking about ever since, never able to make it back to Apothke. But this was a different night, we got in easily, no line, and the bar was just waiting for our orders. The Kale in Comparison cocktail includes organic quinoa vodka, fresh kale juice, pineapple, ginger, lime and agave, and a smoked salt rim. Perfection. I had two and left happy. And probably much healthier, right? Lest you think I am a regular kale eater or organic quinoa kind of a guy... I'm not. I was at one time the world's worst vegetarian, basically eating cheese pizza and spaghetti for 13 years. This cocktail is amazing, worthy of my obsession, and finally I made it back! Okay, there's another obsession worthy drink: Sitting Buddha. With vodka with lemongrass, fresh pineapple, cilantro, fresh ginger root, squeezed lime, and agave. Damn good. Glad to be back! Now I can shut up about this kale drink, my friends will be happy never to hear me talk about it again. Yelp, now it's on you! Great place and a really cool speakeasy. It does look like the place is closed but when I stepped in - such a spacious, beautiful place. The bartenders really do their thing and I had fun watching them. I honestly don't know what the name of the cocktail was that I was drinking and I wish I remembered, but it was soooooo good. It was a rye cocktail and I told the bartender to surprise me. lol. It was amazing. Will return again for sure. No doubt about it. I'm so happy I checked this place out! This place is awesome once you're in and at the bar. Expect to wait up to an hour from the time you arrive till you get to the bar on a weekend. I would pre-game just to make that hour more tolerable. Once you're inside, the ambience is amazing! Music is great. The set up of this place is awesome; the decorations are very interesting! I didn't have to use the bathroom but went in anyway to see what it looked like. We went on a Friday so the bartenders were busy but they were still polite and courteous. The cocktails are an experience; all the ones we tried were good. Oh! Don't forget to try some absinthe. In summary, this place is a unique experience that everyone should try! This time we tried the Kale in Comparison and the Stolen from Eden because we needed to get in our veggies for the day. Both well-balanced, and tasted healthy and green and still gave me a bit of a buzz. I'd say it was a productive night. Not sure if these elixirs really live up to their prophetic labels but I'd like to think so. I was reluctant to believe that I could consume (alcoholic) beverages with egg whites, kale, beet etc. but not only was it easy, they make it enjoyable to do so. I happily sipped my drinks, lost count, and tried others'. I could pick a bad one in the bunch. Dr. Ruth MAY have been my favorite among the contenders. Decor and bar were sexy and intimate but not cliche. Great hidden drink spot in Chinatown. We came on 12/23 around 9 pm so because it was a holiday weekend and early, we were able to snag a table early on. The drinks here are probably the best I've ever had and as it gets later into the night, it turns from a cool speakeasy feel into a fun dancing bar. If I could have their drinks every day, I would!! Our friend took us here. The place was packed. There were limited seating, most people just stood by the bar area. The floor area was cleared up a bit from the crowd at times since they also had some dancing event going on. We stayed until it was late and were able to sit at a table after a group of people left. Some of the drinks that we tried: Sitting Buddha, Mr Tallymon, Dr Ruth, Tokyo Drift, Professor Plum, Deal Closer, A Daisy If You Do, Silk Road, The Matador, Stolen From Eden. All of them tasted very good and came in beautiful presentation. I also enjoyed seeing the bartenders wearing the lab-coat like it's a mad-scientist/chemist going on there. Drinks all very different. Cool ambience. Definitely my to go place when I'm around China town. The place is like a chemistry lab. Had my first absinthe here. Such a fun night here! I came on a Wednesday night with two other friends and we were surprised to learn at the door that we needed a password to get in (hint: if you don't know the password check their Instagram) and once we got it correct, he let us through! Apparently on Wednesday nights they have a burlesque show accompanied by a jazz band/singer. It honestly feels as if you've been transported back to the 20s or 30s which was amazing! The singer was incredibly talented and it was a wonderful environment just to sit with a friends and relax after work. For a Wednesday it was pretty lively! As for drinks they were strong &amp; delicious but pricey (not surprising though as this is NYC). Definitely recommend coming for the experience though! I was turned away at the door because I was wearing tan Levi's boots and told ""Timberlands"" were against the dress code. I can't help but think this prohibition (along with no ""caps/sports attire"") is in place to keep black folks out. Will not even attempt to come back - I'll be taking my patronage to places that don't have racist/classist dress codes. Have to be super honest- I thought this place was totally fake every time I went to Nom Wah Tea parlor next door. My friend and I stopped in here during the summer and loved the vibe. I forget the drinks we had, but the ""chemists"" behind the counter are really good at recommending drinks. The prices are more than the average cocktail bar, but considering the ingredients they use, it's well worth the trip. This place is not for getting totally wasted... so yeah. After having dinner in Chinatown at Tasty Hand Pulled Noodles right around the corner, a friend and I decided to check out Apotheke. After hearing about this place and only being in Chinatown at the most inconvenient times, this was the perfect moment. We got there around 8 on a Saturday night and luckily it was not crowded yet. No line out the door, which would have deterred me for sure and the doorman wasn't there yet so we walked right in. There was no seating left but standing at the bar was good enough for us and since you can check your coat or any bag you have, it is do-able. I love the decor. There are a few couches pushed to the wall, the lighting is dim, they left what looked like some of the original structure to the building such as the ceiling and they designed it to look like an old European apothecary (hence the name). The bartenders are even wearing pharmacy coats. The menu is one of the most creative I have seen. The menu is divided into categories to go with the apothecary theme. 1) Health and Beauty; 2) Stress Relievers; 3) Pain Killers; 4) Stimulants; 5) Aphrodisiacs; and 6) Euphoric Enhancers. We started with the Dragon Fly and the Paid Vacation, which were both good. The Dragon Fly looks like a popular drink since a lot of people were getting it. Its a refreshing drink since it has the Sunflower blossom tea but has a little kick I think with the habanero bitters and wheat grass. The Paid Vacation is the best kind of spicy. Our final drinks were the Huntsman and the Kale in Comparison. The Huntsman is one of the most creative drinks on the menu served with scotch with duck fat, fig, chocolate, balsamic vinegar glaze, lime agave and a scotch mist. In don't know how, but this drink works and I dont know how to describe it, but its one of the most pleasant scotch drinks I have had and I dont drink scotch. The Kale in Comparison was also good. It literally tastes like a green juice with vodka, so only get it if you like green juice. Around ten, Apotheke starts getting annoyingly crowded, especially around the bar. Actually just around the bar. I think since there are only around six couches and this is a popular place for big groups, the only place to congregate is the bar but then the middle of the lounge is empty. They should try to fix this some how because it seems like a waste of space? Also I can see why some people would say the drinks are too sweet. With the Huntsman, you expect a heavy scotch drink, but it was actually sweat and light. I love a good speak easy, and Apotheke doesn't disappoint. The drinks are quite inventive and equally tasty. Drinks alone, Apothoke is deserving of 5 stars, took a star off because they dont limit the crowd, so it quickly goes from a chill speak easy vibe (where you are likely to find a comfortable spot to loiter) to a typical bar that is over crowded and uncomfortable. Waitress and bartenders however are on point and speedy. Amazing little cocktail bar with great live tunes. I came on a Tuesday night and saw the High &amp; Mighty Brass Band which was a super fun show.I got the Dead Poet which had some smoke infused in the bourbon based drink and really enjoyed it.It's spendy but it's Manhattan so I think it's reasonably priced for the area and definitely worth it for the cocktail quality and atmosphere. Brilliant theme and decor. The drinks are fantastic and it's fascinating to watch the ""chemists"" mix them. Here's the problem: the drinks are mad expensive and the atmosphere is pretentious. Apparently I was dressed a little too casual for the place and they only let me in because I was with a group. Excuse me for wearing comfortable shoes in NYC! I'll stick with my tried and true dive bars where nobody gives a damn if I'm wearing sneakers. Went there with a friend on Saturday night. It was packed but we managed to find seat. The drinks are great. The names are really creative. I got the Dead Poet, it was strong and it tastes like the drink I had in angels share, I guess it's called daewoo? (100% spell it wrong) the services there were great! I came here for drinks to celebrate my birthday.  This has always been on my list of places to try because I have always walked past and seen a lot of people waiting in line to go in.  I came on a Friday night and did not have to wait long to enter.  However, I thought the staff here were really rude.  First off, let's start with the bouncer. I came with friends and told my friends they were too casual, but he'll let them slide this time.  Really, being too casual is an issue? It wasn't like they were dressed in basketball shorts and sneakers.Next, let's go into the place, it is nice but there was limited seating. A few couches and tables which was fine, but there was also limited space to stand around.  The place was dark and the music can get really loud.  Half the time you have to scream to each other.  Finally, let's go into the drinks.  A lot of people crowd around the bar so it's not easy to even order a drink.  So be prepared to wait a while to even get a drink.  The drinks definitely looked pretty, but they do not taste that good.  Strong, but that's not the issue.  They do have interesting combinations like using kale which I thought wasn't bad, but if kale isn't your thing like for my friends I wouldn't recommend it.  So they do have some healthy booze.  However, be prepared to pay $16-20 for drinks.  So drinks are pricey here, but I guess that is expected for a place like that.",https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vHGy7vPEid92nCYXYEZNIw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Bi79ny0r7-vgFsFR0efLwg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vyj_509CJKwoF2iWKtlBMA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lC-PxdBKBK8TmMRjn_jdlQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ol13IrY9dAPybJE6eUHZog/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZOV1dlATE2bmGx-iRao0qg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VBO_CtXaWgRnJrEqmXtW9g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/djiajSL29HGxZMdJCOUe9w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9pMM1sjynioZOiNjLZ17zg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DEdKYj686CQUu41Csew9WQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Fl9RmyEuszysVA5hyTXwNw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Sd7Y4-vfiubwR0OgcKLrDw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NJINFgA3LZ52Wlrw2oRzlg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HXLnGV3CuDjNBBg1HQwBfQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2_M1fcOZ_QhEOZuH95n02w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vb1VZ8wN2XsHQOKXBozFSQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hUZu3rq5bVpRMfupDWo5yg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4P8G71Aq8WNCog_m3GXj-A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Q7y0XvX-NpMUVGz4tTHyYg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tLHgJStDPVeNNUZynqbH9w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5LSBCPdLhf06kZrhT_Otsg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/M4-Q0quIVUAKD8caEeymaQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/g1nbZ-QN-pa3pUOq-7MgoA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fDNST0NJb53BWApoJKcRWQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZuK9vO0IJWp9bXDeYiI7Iw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BiQK53Dk8hZX1GrJ2hrw2g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kURU53-PxvwFNvZ1FPAC7A/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/attaboy-new-york,attaboy-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Cocktail Bars,NA,NA,"This place is all that is right and wonderful with New York City. This dark, chic, cocktail bar is one of my favorite hidden gems. On the outside it doesn't look like much (looks like a door to an apartment) but the inside is gorgeous and secretive. Best part? No drink menu. Tell the waiter/bartender what you're feeling, a song, a memory, etc. and they will make you a cocktail accordingly. I told them to make me a drink that ""tastes like Patsy Cline sounds"" and it was 'Crazy' good. Looking forward to my next trip back :) This was everything I hoped for it to be. Had a surprise date night here and it was just right. All of the speakeasy vibes. You wait outside of what appears to be an alteration shop and enter into a dimly lit bar. Not sure if it'd just opened when we arrived, but it was empty aside from two other patrons. As expected, the bartender asked what I was in the mood for. I said whiskey and citrus and he created the most perfect cocktail--Blackberry Gold Rush. It was insanely good and just the right amount of strong. It was perfection. The music was also really great, so kudos to whoever's playlist was on that night. My second drink was what I asked for but not quite what I wanted. My bad I guess. I said refreshing and he created a strawberry, melon refresher topped with ginger ale. Too light for my liking, but next time I'll stick to the Blackberry Gold Rush or something along those lines. When I heard that Attaboy was #8 on the World's best bar list, I knew I had to see for myself what this LES haunt had to offer. What to look for: Nondescript metal door labeled with ""AB"" stickers. What to do: Ring the door bell. One of the bartenders will come out. He or she will add you to the waiting list. When you ask when you can have a seat expect to be told they have no idea. Wait across the street at the wine bar or go to the corner bars elsewhere.What to expect: Our group of 4 went out in single digit weather and waited 1 hr for a booth to open up. It's dark inside. Really dark. And really cramped. There's noise but loud enough to hear each other talk without yelling. It feels like the cleanest, quietest dive you've ever been to.What to order: The bartender comes to your table and asks what flavors you like. Our table asked for: 1) sweet, but not too sweet, with citrus, 2) sweeter and citrus, 3) smoky, 4) smoky but with some sweetness. The favorite: the strawberry honeysuckle- sweet, citrusy, with bursts of pulp. The smoky drinks ended up tasting like straight bourbon. The sweet but not too sweet was a little strong for my taste. Damage: $18/drink , but hey, it's New York.Consensus: for an hour wait, would definitely come back for a visit. But for the average wait, which is 2+ hours, for such a cramped environment and unknown time to table, I'm not sure if I would return. Hour wait at 2am on a Saturday. Civilized bouncer called Hunter. Quite possibly a pseudonym. Non-pretentious barmaid Katherine. Music is at a volume where one can converse at normal speaking volume.  No one dancing. No ugly people making out in full view.I believe they may only serve bourbons and whiskys. No ginger ale. No colas. Except Katherine took pity on my date and provided Coke as a mixer. Bravo, Attaboy, bravo! I felt the need to post this review for a few reasons.  First, this place is hyped.  It's ranked a top bar in the world on a list somewhere.  Obviously there's going to be a wait at the nondescript door and I expected some level of BS for a newcomer, because after all this is New York.  I'm about to detail what we experienced for two women showing up to enjoy a cocktail on a Monday night.  I can't emphasize MONDAY NIGHT enough.  We first arrived in the 10-10:30 PM window.  Door Guy, who we later learn is Everything Guy, greeted me and let me know it would be about 30 minutes.  Fine.  We already arrived, and would be more than happy to return, cause we're on a mission now if it's this good on MONDAY NIGHT.Fast forward to 11 PM.  I receive a call to come back, and our party of 2 ladies returns with a man friend in tow.  Everything Guy comes outside and lets us know our extra body is unexpected, he just may not have the space.  At this point I thought I was being transported to an alternate universe.  He then ushered us in to a dark corner of the bar just inside the door.  It was cramped, but doable, and we were about to order.Everything Guy reappears, suddenly happy to see us, letting us know how miraculously a table has opened at now 11:30 PM on a Monday.  What are the chances?  We are seated like we're about to partake in the Last Supper.  I get the no menu thing, in fact found it to be the most logical part of this adventure.  My cocktail, a bourbon concoction, was average.  Was it worth the trip?  Probably not.  What happens next solidifies the mark of a horrible service experience.  In a sentence, we were underwhelmed and wanted to get out of there after 1 round.  We were mostly polite about our desire to exit until we were ignored for at least 20 minutes.  The same guy now walking past, glancing at, and ignoring us with his horrible attitude while we were just trying to pay our bill.  I believe I said something on my way out.  I don't remember what it was, but here lies everything I have to say.  Never again. A true speakeasy. Totally nondescript exterior. You're going to walk right past it. Trust. It was early evening on a Thursday and it was a full house. I gather that they go to standing room only on the weekends. So expect a wait towards the end of the work week. Plan accordingly. But your patience will be rewarded. These are grown up cocktails. Complex and packs a wallop... if that's what you're looking for. And be sure to tell the bartender exactly what you're looking for. A rummy like me is easy to please. Put more than one rum in my drink and I'm over the moon. I was too busy enjoying it so I didn't take notes on what I had... not that it wasn't explained to me, I was just being a lazy hedonist. But once the bartender knew what I liked, he hit it out the park every time. For some reason I was completely fixated on the ice. I'm an ice eater, so the honking big pieces they have to chip in order to fit into your rocks glass completely did me in. I considered it an accomplishment to get one cube down enough to actually eat. Otherwise it's wasted ice! You can't waste ice! But the beauty of large ice is that it keeps your drink well chilled without watering it down. So all my other drinks were packing from start to finish. Yum. The bar is long with small booths in the back. It's not a place for very large groups. It's intimate, made for conversation. It can get a bit loud if there are loud talkers, but my partially deaf self didn't have a problem. I enjoyed sitting at the bar because I love watching professionals mix drinks. Dueling shakers are music to my ears. Their work is labor intensive and I fully appreciate it. A bar is only as good as its staff and these guys are top notch. You will enjoy their labors. Trust. Expensive, but worth it. I'm not usually the gal who will spend 17 bucks on a drink...even in Manhattan. Really intimate spot so I was concerned my two friends and I might not get a spot. We came @ 6:30 on a Thursday evening and had no problem getting a really nice booth. I would definitely also suggest sitting by the bar so you could watch the bartender make the drinks...they are super unique. The bar was super well run and organized. You basically just give the bartender some flavors or types of liquor you like and they come up with a really cool concoction.I had two drinks and both were super refreshing and strong. Worth the money in my opinion.As the night went on, the music got louder and more upbeat. Would definitely return for a special occasion. No food, so don't come hungry! Plenty of restaurants in the area though, so you'll be fine. Cool conceptual speakeasy that has a cozy charm inside. Bartenders were conversational and answered my questions. First, this Yelp page and the noted webpage was not created by the owners. I guess it's some sort of cult following thing. Even on a Wednesday night you may have a hard time getting in. A New York speakeasy found! Ring the doorbell and fingers crossed.This is a cramp and super intimate space. If you're with a group then there's only 3 or so booths so expect to wait. You can leave your number with them, and they will call when a booth opens up. Otherwise, hop on in at the bar. If you're there even before they're expected to open, also expect to wait. We encountered a gal that said she waited 30 mins. :/Drinks are basically $17 and are customized according to your taste buds. I was feeling a sweet/fruity cocktail, and the bartender created a cherry honeysuckle for me.The drinks weren't amazing or out of this world. It was about the experience and sharing a drink with friends. I was truly amazed by their cocktails! I would definitely go back again, and see if it's worth five stars. In a bar with no menus, I wouldn't ask for any classic cocktails. Instead, I tried my best to think of uncommon ingredients/tastes for cocktails.For the first drink, I wouldn't comment much. A waitress/hostess took my order, and I highly doubted her knowledge of cocktails (she said they have amaretto, but couldn't make almond flavored drinks....). The drink turned out to be really good, but not similar to what I told her. I guess she must not have communicated well with the bartender.The second one, which I ordered directly with the bartender, was mind-blowing. We asked for two drinks with two distinct cookie flavors and with no use of milk. They were unbelievable. They tasted exactly like hazelnut cookie and butter cookie. Both were bourbon based. The hazelnut one contained egg yolk, honey and vanilla liqueur (there's no hazelnut, but both of us tasted hazelnut). The butter one contained bananas and something else. The alcoholic taste mixed so well with the cookie taste. I was truly amazed by how they were able to do it. My favorite bar ever! One of the best bars in the world and the city. Best thing is that they don't really have a menu - they ask you what you are in the mood for and make a drink that EXACTLY matches what you want. Haven't tried better cocktails.The bar is also a cozy and small speakeasy where you feel really comfortableJust amazing! Please try it, you won't regret it. Please take into account that you should either go on a weekday and expect to wait about an hour or during the weekend no later than 6 pm. The waiting times can be impossible otherwise. I wasn't sure what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised.  This place is cozy and comfortable.  We showed up at 6 PM and we were greeted outside at the door.  Once our ID's were checked we were escorted in and seated at the bar.  The place is dimly lit and very quaint.  The bartender came over, gave us water and asked us what we like to drink.  The bartender created a cocktail based off of what I told him I enjoy.  The drink was fantastic, although pricey ($18).  The bartender was friendly and not pretentious at all.  I would definitely go back here. The door was pretty hard to find because you would pass by it and be like, is it this place? There was absolutely no markings so unless there's a line outside you probably won't find the door. The drinks were on the more expensive side and sometimes I feel like the people in there are rather snobby but the drinks I had were all good. A great little intimate spot for sure! It can get a bit loud so if you prefer a more cozy/intimate setting I would suggest coming a bit earlier before the crowd appears. Attaboy is basically my dream bar. It's dark, intimate, cozy, casual, and delivers an excellent drink. All this, without taking itself too seriously.As is my wont, I encouraged our party of four to arrive just shortly before opening in order to ensure we could be promptly seated. Apparently, we weren't the only ones with the same idea -- there was another group of drinkers already ahead of us when we rolled up a few minutes before the host started showing patrons in.As other Yelpers have noted, go early or be prepared to wait. (And I don't wait.)I didn't realize Attaboy doesn't offer drink menus until we were seated and a server explained the ordering system to us. It reminded me of Boston's Drink, back before Drink became the crowded, scene-y frat party that it is now.Both tipples I sampled were flawlessly executed and delivered with aplomb, exactly to my specifications (aged spirit base, spirit forward, featuring potable bitters). I fully appreciate a cocktail lounge that gets it right, down to the details of visually perfect transparent ice.On one hand, I'm a little disappointed that Attaboy isn't closer to home. I could see this becoming my local if I lived nearer. On the other hand, I'd probably be broke as fuck if they were, because their pricing reflects the superb experience they deliver.They've easily landed a place in my roster of top five favorite bars in the city, which is no mean feat. This speakeasy is as cute as it gets! Very, very narrow bar but it has the right feel. The bartenders were very knowledgeable and made a drink of my liking every time. Easy to find once you realize this gem is behind an ordinary metal door. Even this beer guzzler of a dude can enjoy a libation made from the finest ingredients now and then. The boozier the better I say. Living well is so choice.I could not believe that it had taken me this long to partake in the wonder of a liquid refreshment at this establishment. A good friend of mine asked me to accompany him on a bro-date and embellish in an evening of cocktails, conversation, carousing, and devious behavior. Who am I to decline an invite of such stupendous possibilities?I have a soft spot for Speakeasies, as they take me back to a more civilized time of NYC history. When gentleman had manners, broke the law, and drank in secret during the idiotic Prohibition years, while keeping it all hush hush. Honor among thieves for sure.As we pulled up in a taxi I was enthralled to realize that Attaboy was now housed in the old Milk &amp; Honey location. Same nondescript metal door with no markings or signage letting you know a bar was there. (look for the fake tailor shop next door) We walked up and knocked on the door to enter, and were met by a doorman who happened to recognize my bud from a previous night there. He told us there would be a short wait of 20 minutes maybe so we hung around, and we actually got in a bit quicker. He escorted us to the bar area and asked if we could hold on for a booth, or if we would like a few seats at the bar as it might be a quicker seating. Of course, we took the bar. Everyone knows the best seats in a speakeasy type joint are at the bar. Great perch to watch the drinks being made, and view the bartenders work their magic. Plus, it's a social thing to me, as chatting up the bartender is always fun. Plus, you never know when you might be offered something on the house. Just for being friendly and tipping well. Take care of your bartenders, people!The inside space is pretty much similar to what I remember. Long and narrow. Dimly lit. People chatting in hushed tones, but with a look of merriment on their faces. Appropriate music played on a low volume level. Just a few booths in the back for couples or larger groups, and stool seating around the bar which has been enlarged from my last time there. As we sauntered over and slid onto our seats I felt as if I had never left this place. I was home.No menus needed. No cocktail list. Just tell the bartender or server what your palate is craving. Whiskey, gin, bourbon, rum. etc. Bitter or smooth. Fruity, sweet, or savory. You name it. From a classic, to a new mix-up of ingredients. Everyone has a favorite. Its all about the mixology here and those slinging the drinks do it right. We sampled many drinks over our visit and each was so different, and so tasty. I was feeling no pain by the the time we left! As with a cocktail bar such as this in NYC it ain't cheap, but it's one of those cocktail adventures you take now and then to splurge on yourself. Or, to take a date and enjoy drinks while getting to know each other on a more deeper level. It's all good.If you lamented the loss of Milk &amp; Honey, and enjoy a perfectly crafted cocktail in a speakeasy atmosphere, chill adult vibe, and outstanding service, then by all means go here. Go here now.Start off with one of my fav cocktails, the Gold Rush, then see where the night takes you. A hole in the wall bar that serves the best cocktails. Their ""Penicillin"" is a must try! So overrated! The host/bartender was incredibly rude, he yelled at my friends and me in the middle of the bar. I don't know his name but he was a tall white guy with glasses and a long ponytail. He also kept staring at me with his palm open when he gave me the check even though I asked him twice to give a minute. Old Fashioned was less than average, it's better at my local bar.  Never coming back here! My favorite bar in the world. You tell the barkeep what you're in the mood for and what spirit you like and he or she, without fail mixes a delicious beverage for you! The seating is intimate and it's dimly lit. Wait time is long but they'll call you when you're up so you can bar hop and explore until then. Will always come back when I'm in the city The wait is long but they let you leave your number and eventually they will text you. It is worth it! It's a small very cozy place with good music and it does have a good volume . The mixologist are very talented . I had two drinks there and they got exactly what I was looking for. There is no menu which in my opinion is what make this place so unique . The talented mixologist with just a couple of questions will create a drink that fits your palette and it will surpass your expectations.",https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/B-ED1yG30QSYGYMpjmqt2w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3YZW_8h63Gzem2sJJ3uaTw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ubVtkCxB4j1h91-vVnpZQg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WcE-ILyDL4A-DofjeJm5TQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Bl6rI6xrTp2mxbcVoLfo-A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hpkUqDuWKTlnCoqGjDIqOA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KxNBxN0jileYTlsptfxZXg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Vw3aiPffPZIeRqap4MmXAQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yuTY-JCBnoFYR41d2TC1kA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/q6sd1tr5pLsBgupvpwhZkw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hmtLuEJ4F7wa5RxzdQerew/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jMAsO1WdaOna0lHINIpTRg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/U5JGn2dof_SfI8iStXTV2A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lOQdJIa-yN3UBiTcbXUQSQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yiRuiqQXcjREnJT7g82bEQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xJSwesQOE28n8CYjrRzJpw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UKig4GxGlV7Dns8LbJF7wA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wbspVFFvjQwrHyRPLoUjGw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gsnXueYhEl5hGkyF5hQNZA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/h_rOmi9LpU3MnuPNrgSo6w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZVom2qJVwcMmSJoB3cvlWg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZUvdwG1gwtQDQOwdysFWtA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yXE-goHebfIdKvcw7p0mfQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oqHvBz3BUkgkz1gPJ9SXKw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mkE4PMU-vyAirk2ntNOLhQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/K6TENsgNzTMB3dWom5EDhQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-cR5CD3BWeU_clEUJ9P4ww/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/C3p5pjZl3wYG-3AekdGg3Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ELcVma-44G_Na0gjUKWyEA/258s.jpg,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/aunt-jakes-new-york,aunt-jakes-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Italian,Wine Bars,Pasta Shops,"This is definitely my favorite spot for authentic handmade pasta in the city! The entire meal was divine and filled with flavor. We even witnessed fresh pasta being made upon arrival. Many thanks to Niko and Anthony for making our dining experience one to remember!My friend and I shared the artichoke and avocado toast, which was hands down the best Avo Toast I've ever had! Imagine smashed avocados topped with fried artichokes, pepper, and freshly grated parmesan. Shortly after our beet pappardelle w/ garlic pecorino and 4 cheese ravioli w/ vodka sauce arrived. The entire meal was equally shared and devoured. Pros:Service - Niko and Anthony gave great recommendations and really catered to our meal requests. Would definitely go back just to experience such awesome service and enjoyable convoFood - fresh, authentic, and rich with flavorAmbiance - hanging plants and reclaimed wood make you feel like you've stepped into another space outside of NY's cold winterCons:Zero Had okay experience overall. They do have some great authentic pasta and their cocktail was good too. I was also pleasantly surprised at how spacious the interior was when I went in further.My friend and I were both very satisfied with our food and the idea of ""customize your own"" pasta. They have many different options to choose from. Food is delicious.The service was what made my experience less than pleasant. I had a waiter who disappeared and didn't come  until we had to go and find. Since he was not around the area, i didn't get my water replenished until ive been eating without water. When we were done with our lunch and ready to leave, we had to wait forever for our waiter. He didn't show up, and we asked another waiter, but he told us that he's not our waiter and cannot do anything. He walked away, which the customers next to us also found it rude.Overall, the pasta and the food is great. My unpleasant customer service shouldn't stop anyone from trying their place. I think everyone will enjoy their authentic pasta, and everyone should try it. We just need to pray for a better service. This place is a hidden gem in my opinion. If I want Italian, ironically I don't head over to Little Italy despite the fact that I work a few blocks away. Reasoning being, I hate being pulled into tourist traps with bad service and/or food. Ugh. Gross. This place however has changed Little Italy for me entirely. Initially the place reminded me of Vapiano south of Union Square where it's basically an open cafeteria. Cool spot but not a place I'd go for a sit down dinner; perhaps lunch. But I was asked to join someone for dinner her and my god the pasta was fresh, the placed was filled with locals and the restaurant was really beautiful. The apps were ok but the main course was really what you need to come here and spend your money on. Don't bother with anything else... except maybe the mousse. If you want a great Italian spot in Little Italy without falling into those dreaded tourist traps, this is the place for you. Con: No bar! :( Went here the other day with a couple of friends for a reserved dinner. The outside decorations were really festive and invited. We came a couple of hours early to our reservation and they were able to sit us down at a ground level table. The place had a really warm Christmas-y vibe too it. Really great playlist in the background. Heard a lil Elton John, some indie hits. When we walked in, to the left there was a guy putting fresh pasta into the machine, great place to put a pasta making station. The menu had various selections of wines and beers and of course various pastas and appetizers. My friends and I all had a variation of the fettuccine nero pasta. I really liked the create your own pasta option. You're able to choose from freshly made pasta shapes and then choose a sauce for your pasta. I ordered the fettuccine nero with the Arrabiata sauce. One of my other friends ordered the fettuccine nero with the chicken bolognese sauce. And one of my friends ordered the fettuccine nero vongole.Our server was really attentive and knew the menu really well. Warm and and a delightfully airy basket of house made garlic sticks were served out. I wish we could ask for more, but I think they you had to pay more. The manager was walking around asking how the food was and joked that it was only ""good"". I love a place that can joke around, you saw that he really liked his work and everyone looked like they enjoyed being there.   The fettuccine nero with the arrabiata sauce was really really flavorful. I've never had fettuccine nero before but it was definitely a pleasant surprise. Squid ink is mixed into the dough made from semolina flour so the pasta has this rich dark black color to it. The pasta was rough in a good way, had a nice texture to it. The arrabiata sauce was smooth and spicy with a nice hint of chili pepper and a great spice coming from the roasted garlic. The manager asked our table to write up a Yelp review after our meal and here it is haha. This place has all the things going for it. Great service from the staff, great food, warm vibes, and a great playlist. 5/5 stars would recommend, would definitely come back again to eat some more food. I was really hesistant to come back after how salty everything was last time. BUT I AM GLAD I GAVE AUNT JAKE'S ANOTHER TRY. I made reservations for a table of 2 on a Friday night and was seated right away. The place was packed, but the manager and our wonderful server (Nicolas) made sure everything went smoothly. Our server made the best wine recommendation and it paired really nicely with our food. We ordered the mussels to start and the broth was delicious. I also ordered the Tagliatelle with the Sunday Sauce. They were super generous with the amount of meat and the pasta was very fresh. Aunt Jake's is truly one of my favorite places in Little Italy. First things first, the pasta is amazing! Secondly, Anthony hosted our pasta class and it was a complete delight! We drank wine, cut pasta shapes, learned a little lingo and then ate family-style with our group. I definitely recommend this class to others - friends, couples and groups alike. Molto Bene! I   had   some   time   to   kill,   was   by   myself,   but   wanted   something   tasty,   easy,   and   fresh.   I   soon   realized   I   was   out   of China   Town   and   in   Little   Italy   (my   dream),   and   didn't   know   where   to   even   start   for   finding   a   place   to   eat.   Aunt Jake's   should   be   everybody's   first   stop   in   LI   (little   Italy,   not   to   be   confused   w/   long   island).I   was   seated   in   the   back   room,   which   is   more   spacious,   very   light,   airy,   and   feels   like   a   greenhouse.   It   has   all open   windows   above   which   is   beautiful,   with   simple,   rustic   decor.   There's   another   backroom   that   looks   a   bit outdated   and   darker,   but   that   might   be   more   formal   for   their   dinners.   The   service   was   prompt,   the   prices   were very   reasonable,   and   the   ambiance   was   very   relaxing,   quaint,   and   authentic.   The   kitchen   is   open,   and   you   can watch   them   hand   roll   and   hand   cut   the   pasta,   and   then   make   your   sauces   all   right   in   front   of   you!My   favorite   part   of   Aunt   Jake's   is   the   menu.   They   offer   several   homemade   pasta   types   that   you   then   pair   with any   of   their   homemade   sauces.   It's   incredible.   The   pasta-bilities   are   endless.   I   want   to   try   every   single   type!   I got   the   fettucini   with   vodka   sauce   and   it   was   so   creamy,   flavorful,   and   super   fresh.   The   bread   is   a   4.5/5.   One   of my   favorite   things   was   the   massive   water   they   give   you   for   the   table.This   would   be   a   great   spot   to   stop   for   lunch,   or   a   great   dinner   date   spot   that   isn't   too   fancy   or   pricey,   but   the food   is   top   notch.   I   will   most   certainly   be   back. Like most people, coming to Little Italy is an overwhelming experience because you have so many people yelling for you to go into their restaurants, claiming theirs are the best, free round of drinks, etc., so I've found it's really much more helpful to depend on recommendation of friends to figure out exactly which place to try (unless you have the time and passion for Italian food, then by all means try them all!)Came to try Aunt Jake's by the recommendation of friends, and from the moment we walked in the door it did not disappoint. We were kindly greeted and shown to a nice little table in the back. Decor was lovely and chic, and everyone greeted us with such smiles.Our server was also friendly and helpful, made sure we had everything we needed, and even brought some jokes to our dinner table. Prices are fair for the quality of food, which is absolutely delicious by the way. Your options for pasta are their specials that are pre-set and selected, or you can build your own by ordering the type of pasta and the sauce/toppings, which is one of my favorite things - being able to build my own meal to all my favorite things! You can select the individual portion size or choose the larger family share portion. Their garlic-y bread sticks were also a MUST try. Overall, definitely recommend Aunt Jake's, five star experience all around! Bravo! Oh my gosh this is my first 2 star review and it's so hard for me to write this! Atmosphere: 5 stars. Excellent. Cozy, cute, trendy  Service: 2 stars :( our server was so inattentive and unfortunately kind of an awkward communicator. Food: no stars?? They were out of gluten free pasta on a Friday night and didn't have any alternatives. They didn't have shrimp and the special was shrimp scampi? I'm so disappointed! I've read great reviews about this place but honestly I had a terrible experience. So many great restaurants in nyc and particularly in Little Italy. Go elsewhere Love the atmosphere here! Staffs are so friendly and efficient. We were seated under the ceiling windows. They gave us complementary garlic bread sticks while we're browsing the menu. Ordered marinated mushrooms for appetizer, fettuccine Nero vongole, fettuccine Nero with arrabiata sauce, ravioli with marinara sauce and grilled chicken, glass of ros, sav Blanc, and east side cocktail. * Marinated mushrooms were quite nice, sauted then mixed in some arugula, good combo. * Fettuccine Nero vongole was a bit bland for my friend. It wasn't amazing, but it was good. It's a very settle dish with the clams and white wine sauce. Fettuccine was made with squid ink but it doesn't really have any special taste. * Fettuccine Nero with arrabiata sauce was delicious. The way it came out needs a little salt and pepper, which they have that in the table. Other than that it's the perfect portion and authentic. * Ravioli with marinara sauce was amazing! The grilled chicken I added was a tiny bit dry, but flavors were there. Eat the ravioli while it's hot! Once the cheese cools off it's not as good. I think I needed a little more sauce with the extra chicken and the bread they served with this. Otherwise give this a go! * Ros was ok, sav Blanc was great with the ravioli, ended up enjoying 4 glasses. I do prefer bigger wine glass so that the wine isn't poured to the top. East side cocktail was eh, can skip it. My friend said it was very weak and it wasn't worth the $11. Overall I would come back and try other pastas. I also saw a lot of people dining in themselves, when it got dark they gave each table a candle. Very good experience here! Great food. Beautiful interior. Friendly staff (a little slow on service). My boyfriend and I randomly came across this restaurant and without a doubt was absolutely in love with its ascetically pleasing interior! It's a beautiful restaurant, perfect for a date night or a girls luncheon during the day. The staff was very friendly and quick to seat us. The service was a little slow as there were 2, mayyyyybe 3 servers working on the entire floor that busy night with full tables of large parties. The food there was GREATTT! The proportions were huge.. way bigger than expected! My bf got the chicken parm and it was bigger than his face! But it was super delicious! I got the tagliatelle with Sunday sauce and it was sooo yummy.. the bread that came with the dish was in a little heart shape, which was a cute finishing touch to its massive pasta bowl! All in all, highly recommended!! Definitely want to go back and try other pastas on the menu! All the pastas and sauces are made in-house. They're divine!Baby John, the owner, walked us over from his canoli place across the street. He told us to make sure to order the ""Sunday Sauce."" Good call, Johnny!! It had all kinds of delectable, tender, meats in a super flavorful red sauce. YUM! Everyone at our table of 4 had different meals and every one was super delicious.Service is spot on. My daughter spilled a glass of wine, and the staff flew in to action like a NASCAR pit crew. Every drop of evidence of malfeasance was gone immediately without a trace.There are tons of choices in Little Italy for Italian food. You WILL NOT find a better spot than Aunt Jake's!Capiche?!!? Bomb place for create your own pasta.I loved Aunt Jake's because I could mix and match the type of pasta noodles and the sauces. I got the Roasted Garlic Pecorino sauce (garlic cream) and my friend got the Alla Vodka sauce (tomato cream) and we both really liked our choices. I will come back to try the other sauces.The restaurant has very cute interior design and made me forget that I was in the middle of the busy city.-- taste / 4aesthetics / 5vibe / 5service / 3price for quality / 3OVERALL / 4 Beautiful interior, great atmosphere, and delicious pasta. Who knew pasta could be instagrammable? We went on a Saturday in the early evening without a reservation and were luckily seated right away. When you walk in, it looks dark and like a small empty pasta shop in the front, with people making pasta from scratch there. You walk into the back for the sitting area, and wow! It's like you're in a sunroom...in the middle of NYC. Very bright, great atmosphere. I love the concept, where you could make pairings of types of pasta with sauces. I do wish they had recommended pairings on the menu, but the waiter was very helpful. I got the Fettuccine Nero (squid ink) with chicken bolognese sauce, which was delicious. The noodles tasted soft and fresh, and the sauce was delicious. It was a little on the pricey end for pasta ($12-18 for the pasta base, $2-4 for the sauce) but hey, that's NYC. I think it was worth it. I came here on a Wednesday afternoon with my two month old baby. It wasn't super busy. The servers helped me with the stroller right away and sat me indoor under the glass ceiling windows. The restaurant has a very cute and comfortable ambiance. They give you complimentary butte garlic bread twists. It was warm and fluffy. I ordered the squid ink clam pasta ($22). It was really yummy! The clams were cooked and seasoned just right. The pasta was al dente. I highly recommend and would definitely order again.It was my first time dining out with my baby alone. My baby fussed a little bit but none of the servers were bothered by it which I was really glad. I made reservations for a big party for me and my friends' annual holiday gathering. Can't wait to try their other dishes! I've lived in NYC for 7 years, and this is the only restaurant in Little Italy that my wife and I go to and bring our guests to. We are extremely picky and this place is beautiful and the food is delicious. They make all their pasta and you can watch them do it. You must get the avocado toast. Wish they still had the ricotta toast! Get a table in the back! Beautiful ambiance, aesthetically pleasing, friendly staff, quick service, DELICIOUS dinner! I came here on Wednesday at 7pm and the place was empty. We were seated in the back. It was extremely dark and hard to see but the ambiance was very intimate and romantic. I would say it's perfect for a date. We ordered:Artichoke and Avocado Toast - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! My god whoever thought of putting fried artichoke on avocado toast is a genius. It was such a perfect pairing. There was PLENTY of avocado (mixed with onions, tomatoes or pepper flakes I think?) topped on toast that was soft inside and chewy outside. It was garnished with some sort of cheese. All the flavors blended together nicely.Beef Meatballs - 1 serving comes with 3 large meatballs. It sits in a tomato sauce that had perfect consistency. Slightly acidic and not overly salty. The meatballs were moist and very good.Tagliatelle with broken meatball - Unfortunately the pasta was the least memorable. I had several bites and remembering that the tagliatelle was tasted homemade. The ingredients used were definitely fresh. The amount of sauce was lacking in my opinion. I'm almost certain that the sauce was the same as the beef meatball but this was slightly sweeter. It was good but not the best I've had. The price leans towards more expensive side but I left comfortably full. I can't wait to come back for brunch or even to grab a drink. Out of all the Little Italy restaurants this is certainly the most casual and least touristy.Went here early enough in the evening where they were fairly accommodating with a larger table (6) for my group of 4.While the food was delicious I did find it surprisingly get quite busy on a Monday as it progressed towards 8pm. I think so did the staff as it became immediately evident how understaffed they were with just 3 waiters serving the entirely filled restaurant.The food was delicious, atmosphere was right, and the service still came with a smile despite being behind due to the rush of folks.Normally 3 stars, but given the location, lack of high pressure sales person out front, lesser amount of tourists, and coupled with legitimately delicious food it gets a bonus star. I visited Aunt Jakes with a group of 5 while my family was visiting NY. When looking for a reservation, it was hard for me not to choose a restaurant in Little Italy with a fancy Italian name... and while this place doesn't have the most authentic name, I can assure you that they have plenty of authentic food!Upon arrival, the host sat us at a table in a large room decorated for the holidays. It was busy on a Saturday night, but not crazy busy like some of the other restaurants in the area. Another nice touch is that it was both well lit and the music wasn't overbearing. I could actually have a conversation with others at the table!Our server dropped off a bread basket and water and we contemplated which pasta to try. The whole theme of the restaurant is homemade pastas; you can even watch someone making fresh pasta on the way in. It is VERY fresh and delicious. We eventually decided to try a family-style sized bowl of cavatelli with their famous ""Sunday sauce""- it has 3 types of meat!This bowl of pasta was no joke. 3 of us ate it and we managed to eat about half the bowl. It's also served with more bread because, you know, you can never have enough bread! My mom who is gluten free also enjoyed her gluten free pasta. It was also freshly made!The manager Anthony came over to check on us a few times throughout the meal and even brought over extra cheese (twice!). Thanks Anthony!This was my first trip to Aunt Jakes, but I can assure you that it won't be my last. It was reasonably priced, not a tourist trap like some other Little Italy restaurants, and they give you enough food to feed an entire Italian family. Oh and I saw on their website that they host pasta-making classes, so that would be a fun way to experience the area too! I was here twice, once as a sit down experience many months ago and the second time, a few weeks ago when I took to-go. I feel like they cook the pasta to a point of al dente where it feels undercooked but that is just my opinion, maybe you will like it?I am not impressed with their sauce despite them most likely making it in house it does not taste good. I think the quality has deteriorated and the food is not as good as it used to be. I ordered to-go and asked the sauce be placed on the side. It did not happen and I didn't bother calling them back...But my review is not based on that and simply based on the quality of there pasta and sauce. I tasted better in Brooklyn and, I doubt I will come back for pasta, maybe wine and appetizers as the ambience is very cute and staff is professional just not going to order pasta again.

https://www.yelp.com//biz/balthazar-restaurant-new-york,balthazar-restaurant-new-york,New York,10002,NY,French,Breakfast & Brunch,NA,"I had been wanting to come to this place for ages and I finally had the opportunity on my last trip to NYC.  I made a reservation to meet a girlfriend for lunch.  I arrived and was seated. I ordered a glass of wine and shortly thereafter my friend notified me that she was running late.  I felt terrible for taking the table when she was going to be another 20 minutes, but the server seemed pretty understanding.  However, upon bringing my glass of wine he promptly spilled it all over me!  He was super nice and apologetic.  He brought me another glass of wine and when my friend arrived brought us both a glass of champagne to apologize.  Thank God I ordered white!My friend ordered oysters.  I don't eat those but they looked pretty.  We also shared the fries which she said were spectacular and I gotta be honest, they really were.  I also had the beef stroganoff which was incredible.  It was definitely one of the more expensive lunches I've had, but I didn't go here expecting it to be inexpensive.  I think my entree, fries, and wine came to about $70.  I really loved everything about this place.  The fact that I got a whole glass of wine dumped on me and still gave this place 5 stars should tell you how outstanding both the food and service were.  I definitely hope to come back. Came here for an early brunch right as the restaurant opened one Sunday morning.  The restaurant has a opulent feel, almost as if you've stepped into a past reminiscent to me of the roaring 20s meets French brasserie.  Tables are close together and seating for larger parties may be a little more challenging.  This place gets crowded quickly and the hum and din of conversation escalates as a result.  Servers are friendly and the service is quick and attentive.  Baked goods here are delicious (almond croissant!) but we also had eggs muerette (this is pretty heavy for the morning but good) and Balthazar salad.  It was a little on the pricey side, but hey - it's brunch in Manhattan. We went for brunch and I had the corned beef hash. It's not the corned beef I'd normally have where it's chipped and mixed in with potatoes. Here the meat was the type of shredded beef you'd find in a sandwich. It was fine, but not what I was expecting. I did love the eggs though. So full of butter that I am craving them 2 days later. Along with that dish, we ordered the pastry basket allowing us to sample a little of everything. The pecan bun was probably the favorite between us both, though I really liked the chocolate croissant as well. The monkeybread was a bit dry and I wish it was covered in glaze like the pecan bun. The croissant was just another croissant. Service was good, food was expensive and I would probably skip brunch and go with regular ol' breakfast times though. The ambiance is loud and bustling like a french cafe. The amount of food (aka carbs) we ate held us over until dinner. Would I come back? Maybe for traditional brunch if I was in the area. Solid! I came on a recommendation from a friend. Open Table did not have a reservation for dinner until 9:30. I called and they were able to work my party of two in. There was a crowd inside the and the bar was packed however we were seated immediately. The host had a French accent which was super cute. The interior was warm and cozy. Sexy and a bit romantic, but don't me wrong....there were families dining together. We were seated in a corner. I was excited because i read some of the reviews and it mentioned seating can be tight. We, fortunately had plenty of space.  I had spinach as  my side and the duck confit for my main. The meal was everything I had hoped for. Mouth watering in fact! The wait staff was prompt  and accommodating. Very nice dining experience. You know what it is with Balthazar. Its just such a beautiful place. It is this twilight zone moment that you imagine being part of a movie or dream. THAT is the unique selling point of Balthazar. It is definitely not their food.The oysters were absolutely delicious. $24 for 6 oysters. My partner ordered the trout ($31) and I ordered the steak au poivre ($47). The portions are big. And big doesn't necessarily mean better. The steak come with fries and a hump of cooked spinach. The steak itself was nice. Big slab of meat. A bit overdone with the fricking peppers but hey its au poivre so suck it up Richard! The fires were absolutely horrible. They were thin but fried to the core. So no light crunch outside just fatty crusts. I was so disappointed that I send the fries back. I got a new order and they were exactly the same. So its how they make it....ugh not even mediocre. The trout was nice. The veggies with the trout were good. But listen this is a $111.00 dinner. We didn't drink otherwise it would have reached the $180.00. And it really is just diner level in an absolutely beautiful place. There are so many great restaurants with excellent ambiance that offer so much better for this budget. The staff is wonderful. So I tip them generously. How they replace the paper covering your table, is a treat. But guys I am here for my food first. My partner has never been to Balthazar, so she was just excited and happy however for our next anniversary I am choosing the quality food that suits the level of her quality being and that is an A establishment. Balthazar is one of the New York establishments that I'd been looking for an excuse to visit. Thanksgiving Day seemed like the perfect opportunity for an old school feast here. I made reservations about a month in advance for 3 people at noon.Once we arrived, the hostess stand was positively hectic. There were a dozen or so people waiting, with a lot of walk-ins. We got seated about ten minutes late. We were in a comfy red leather banquette, although the wooden area behind us for bag storage needed a deep clean. Decor is that classic faux-French New York bistro.Although there was a Thanksgiving prix-fixe, they also allowed for a la carte turkey plates as well as their regular menu. My mom did the whole shebang ($72), with soup, turkey plate, and pumpkin pie, my dad did the beet salad ($20) and turkey plate ($39), and I did steak-frites ($40). We also did a bottle of Beaujolais, which was easy-drinking and paired well with everything we got.The beet salad was a winner, and more aesthetically pleasing than I would have expected from this standby spot. Soup was good. The steak was cooked to the correct medium rare and was tasty. Fries were sorry specimens with more coating than potato. Every component I tasted of the turkey dinner was good.The pumpkin pie was a highlight-- it's hard to improve on the original but the ice cream and small pool of vanilla bean cream were nice touches. We chose to cap our meals off with cappucinos, and the one I had (decaf) was, no joke, maybe the best I've ever had. (And it should be, at $5.75.) Our server was great despite the holiday rush. The meal was pretty slow paced, especially towards the end. It ended up running nearly two hours. It was a fun place to be in for the holiday, though it felt a little less special given the sheer number of people here. A definite tourist vibe.Overall, I'm glad that I crossed this one off the list, as the food was pretty good and it's an institution, but the prices are so high that I doubt I'll be back. For the love of all that is good in this world, please DO NOT COME HERE! I brought my girlfriend here for her birthday dinner because I was taken by all the rave reviews, but I could not have been more disappointed. It's honestly disgusting how let down we were - the food was horrible and expensive, the space was entirely too cramped and the service lackluster. I cannot comprehend what type of food everyone else had because ours was horrendous. We ordered the small beef tartar appetizer ($22), the trout ($31), and the duck confit ($35). Total was $95.80 before tip.Okay, so everything EXCEPT the beef tartar was atrocious; the beef tartar was phenomenal. It had a great spice combination and the portion was solid for the price. The crustinis that it came with were nicely sized for snacking and the pieces of meat weren't too big or too small. It all went downhill after this...The trout was SUPREMELY unsatisfying. The fish had almost no flavor and the skin wasn't crispy. In fact, I think they went out of their way to make the skin soft and limp so you could more easily remove the meat. That would've been a fine plan had the fish tasted like, well, anything, but it didn't, so you just ended up with bland fish with rubbery skin. The salad that came with the fish was similarly unfulfilling; everything on the dish was sad and pretty much a mile short of mediocre.Next up? Duck confit. Sound good? Wrong. Actually, if you like extremely salty food you may really enjoy this. It was like playing minesweeper with food; not every bite was like taking a big gulp of seawater, but you get really lucky every few bites. If you enjoy salt and oil, this dish is for you. The salad that accompanied the confit? Uninspired. Who even likes leek, anyway? I guess the potatoes were pretty okay, but that's not hard to accomplish when literally everything else on the plate is hot garbage. When we sat down we were going to order the creme brle for dessert but we quickly changed our minds when we tasted the cuisine.Service was very ordinary and not up to standards that one would typically expect with these prices. Our waiter was nice, I guess, but he seemed like he was pulled off the street and couldn't care less about providing great service. And who designed the restaurant layout? Who likes to sit like two inches from the table next to you? No one - that's who. Really unenjoyable experience all around, and I ended up apologizing to my girlfriend for such a terrible birthday dinner... There's no argument about it.It's the best brunch place in New York City! The host will take you to your seats without giving you attitude for missing one or two guests and you can wait at the comfort of your seats until they show up. And what's not to like when you find out that Eric Ripert of famed Le Bernardin is sitting next to your table. Magnifique! 2.5 stars, rounded down.Not very sure why this place gets such stellar ratings. It has mediocre american brunch items for like, 2-3x the price of an average brunch spot. Sure, the atmosphere is cute and it was nice that there was barely a wait for 7 people on a Saturday morning, but I just don't get it??Everyone ordered different things at the table and there wasn't a single thing I thought was very good. I couldn't even finish half my plate. No bueno. No good. Go someplace else. Unless you're starving and don't want to wait and don't mind paying too much for too little.. then go here. Hands down the BEST French restaurant in NYC. I haven't had such a delicious, satisfying meal in a long time. It is pricey, but WELL WORTH it and it'd probably be my go-to for special occasions. The ambiance makes me feel like I flew back to Paris. Each bite was hearty and incredibly satisfying, I left the restaurant with a very happy stomach. I ended up spending $60, but my friends spent $75 with wine. There's a reason this place has been around for so long.. it's a well run, nicely oiled machine that makes amazing food.The escargot was great. Everything an amazing pesto-y garlic-y escargot should be. We were scraping every last drop of that amazing sauce with our bread. DEFINITELY GET THIS. You won't regret it.The duck confit was very earthy and hearty, and the meat was so tender. My favorite part was the wine sauce they had with the mushrooms under the duck.. oh my. The salmon was perfectly moist in the center and crunchy on the outside.. a very well put together meal. The faro in makes you feel healthy for the week, and that salad it came with (whether or not it was for decoration) was SO GOOD. Last but not least, our favorite was the garlic shrimp pasta... WOW the texture was perfectly al dente and incredibly fresh. The sauce was orgasmic.. I LOVE garlic and this was just a little piece of heaven in each bite. The shrimps were cute and good, nothing crazy special but the sauce with that pasta... they really mastered their carbs. Who would have thought the french can make better pasta than the italians. For dessert, we got this meringue with berry compote. Normally I hate berry compotes and meringue is way too sweet for me. But GET THIS TOO, YOU WONT REGRET IT. It comes out nice and warm, the berry compote works really well with the meringue and the whole thing melts in your mouth. The combination and presentation of the dish deserves an award. I don't think it gets much better than that for the price. I definitely recommend the shrimp garlic pasta and escargot. I think duck confit is a stable in french cooking so you should get that too but the salmon you could get somewhere else. If you want dessert, a lot of people including us got the berry compote thing with meringue and it was well worth it. Service was great, our waitress was a little rushed at first but you could tell she had a long day and she made it up with her chill personality. We loved our dining experience at Balthazar.  The restaurant is elegant and classy, the service is professional and attentive, and the food is simply amazing!  Granted, we stopped in for a birthday brunch/lunch on an early Wednesday afternoon and cannot speak to their dinner service.  That said, after playing hooky for the day it's my opinion that mid-week brunch/lunch at Balthazar is something that should happen every week - special occasions be damned.  Anyway, I digress.As an Egg's Benedict addict, I can confidently say that this dish delivers!  The egg's were cooked perfectly, the portion size was generous, and the pommes frites are among the best in the city.  A little birdie told me that Balthazar employs two full-time staff members dedicated solely to making pommes frites (and it definitely shows!).The cheeseburger is also something that you should order!  The meat is well-seasoned, the burger was juicy... and yeah, it comes with a side pommes frites...  Shout out to our waitress who took amazing photos of us! Meh... for some reason my partner decided that we ""must do Balthazar"" for brunch. I don't know why. The brunch here is so basic it's not worth describing. And it's pricey... The service was pretty good (maybe a bit slow) and seating was tight, but there's no magic here...Mostly tourists and New Yorkers who love tradition (as opposed to great food)... we wouldn't return. Obsessed is the word I'd use here! I've been coming here for years and always have an amazing meal with amazing service. Literally, the service is impeccable. I'd recommend the moule frites, goat cheese tart and beet salad. Oh, and let's not forget the champagne. It wouldn't be Balthazar without a bit of bubbly! Cheers to this group for killing it. Every. Single. Time. Had dinner with my other half last week and it was a fabulous experience. We decided to check this place out after watching one of those cooking shows featured the place and their fries. Well...the fries which we of course ordered were probably the least impressive part of the meal. We started off sharing the liver and foie mousse. So good and creamy and rich. The onion confit was a great counterbalance to the decadence of the mousse itself. I ordered the duck leg confit which is the best I've ever had by far. It was like succulent and savory butter over some yummy veggies. My boyfriend  had the special which was essentially a chicken with potato stew dish. Very nice as well.We ended our meal by sharing some profiteroles, ice cream and some strong coffee (bad idea on a school night!). Perfect date night meal.The restaurant itself had the ambiance of a Parisian bistro and, although a bit tightly spaced in some areas (including our table), we managed to have our conversations without screaming across the table.The service was very attentive and, though we did wait a little longer for the check, it was for the most part timely and efficient.Would definitely come back here again as there were other items on the menu I would love to try. POSSIBLE SCAM?After enjoying my meal, I split my $127.40 bill between cash and debit card. Paying $100 in cash, $27.40 on my card &amp; leaving a cash tip for the waiter. I then signed my bill for $27.40.  Balthazar then charged the full $127.40 onto my debit card. Myself &amp; a representative from my bank called Balthazar Restaurant to resolve the issue. They promised to look into it but failed to contact me at the correct e-mail address.After calling back a few days later, the manager insisted that I had paid the full $127.40 on my card. Only after letting him know that I had my receipt of $27.40 did he promise to look into the matter. The manager then miraculously found my correct receipt. We really enjoyed the food here, but the experience with the bill left a bad taste in my mouth. The food and service was excellent. Came here with a party of nine and Marie was our waitress. She was attentive, kind and we never had to look for her. Our order was taken very quickly and Marie made sure everyone was well attended to and quickly made sure our drinks were served. The restaurant provided us with free desserts which were delicious. Most in my party had the steak frites and everyone said how delicious it was. I had the chicken paillard which was very tender and scrumptious. I will definitely come back to this establishment You gotta make reservations for this one - we came in to check in for a late lunch and the place was heaving. I've never seen so many people literally squished up to the front desk area, waiting to check in or waiting for a table. Once we checked in, lunch was efficient and delicious. Lobster bisque was so creamy and rich. The homemade linguine with gulf shrimp, garlic confit, lemon zest, chili oil and basil bread crumbs was garlicy goodness. Kir royale was the perfect start and then a glass of the Pouilly-Fume and I was a happy girl. Ok so I have been wanting to go here since I got back from the south of France 6 months ago. I've only heard people rave about how good the food is and how similar it is to the food I had while traveling in France. It definitely did not disappoint. I felt like I was right back in France at this place. I was with a group of 3 which was a perfect amount. We started off with the steak tartare and the chicken liver and foie gras mousse. They were both amazing and the perfect size. They gave us extra bread which is a plus in my mind! Then we all got the duck confit. This is something I ALWAYS get when I go to a French restaurant without fail. I have to be honest. It was OK... with the high standard I had going into it I was just a tiny bit thrown off. It was delicious don't get me wrong but I expected it to be better. We moved on to desert where we got an almond pear tart. I will leave it at that. The service was excellent. Our waitress was very attentive and also gave us the time we needed and did not rush us through the meal whatsoever. The only thing I would change is the fact that they really pack everything and everyone in. Which, it is a very popular place so they want as many customers as they can fit into the place. It was very loud and it felt a little like people were yelling over the tables next to them. I am very big into bread so when I was leaving and saw the complimentary brioche bread that had been freshly baked and left for people to take home I was very happy. Very good bistro,i have only been here 2 times. What a fantastic brunch experience. Extremely large always packed but food comes out on time.  I personaly love seafood tower and stake . The wine list is great alsoA must place to see and have brunch before you leave nyc. Its expensive but worth it. Oyster mary was great The service and the food was fantastic This was my favorite spot on our NYC Trip. I checked in but I didn't write because i was enjoying it way too much! Our waiter was friendly. The atmosphere was warm and beautifully decorated for Christmas. There was no wait but we had a reservation. They have a famous eggplant steak that is a vegan dish but i went for the waiters recommendation of the shrimp with homemade linguine. It was incredible.. I've never had a pasta that flavorful.

https://www.yelp.com//biz/banh-mi-saigon-new-york,banh-mi-saigon-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Vietnamese,Sandwiches,NA,"They take credit card/debit card.Half of the Banh Mi filled me up before proceeding to Kimchee Fries and chicken wings.Chicken wings were not so tasty but the Banh Mi and Fries were good, it was spicy.I recommend ordering with thai iced tea or bubble tea. I was overall disappointed with this place because of its rave reviews and awards. I will say the area, price, and amount of food you get you can't really go wrong- but as far as Banh mi sandwiches go, the bread was quite soft, and they were made ahead of time and weren't as fresh as they could be. For a quick and cheap lunch or dinner this is a food place with lots of options for vegetarians or variety of meats, but know that there are better Banh mi sandwiches out there! Update: After getting banh mi from Saigon Vietnamese Sandwich Deli, I haven't been coming back here. The sandwich there is far more superior that I can no longer give this place 5 stars. The bun here has always been rock hard, which makes it much harder to eat and enjoy. The tiny chunks meats are so crispy and hard, it seems like they've been stir fried for too long. I was in Jersey City for a business trip and with a free weekend in between. Without wasting the opportunity, I went about exploring in NYC. I happened to stumble upon Banh Mi Saigon and now their signature Banh Mi Saigon with chopped barbecue pork is my #1 on my [non-existent] list of banh mi places in NYC! The barbecue pork is generous, tender, flavorful, and slightly sweet. The baguette is crispy and stuffed with an adequate amount of carrots, radish, cucumber, and pate.The portion is huge for just $5.25 and their serving time is quick. I received and finished my sandwich all within 20 minutes. My sister LOVES Banh Mi sandwiches so I had to take her here while she was visiting. Had never been but was told this was the place to get Banh Mi in Chinatown. Went on a Sunday afternoon, once we walked in, the whole process of ordering and getting our food took about 5 minutes. We got the Banh MI sagon (BBQ pork spicy) which cost $5.25. Compared to other foods in NYC, this felt like a great deal although it was a lot of white bread. We shared the first half and I ate the second half for lunch the next day. The pickled veggies with cilantro complimented the BBQ pork seamlessly. The pork had a nice crunch to it that even a day later, was as good as it was the first bite. It has to be one of the best foods that withstands time for such a low price.Overall: Such cheap Banh Mi with a great BBQ pork that could be lunch for two days :) Came by on a Saturday and there was no line around midday. I got the classic and thought it was decent. Not the best in the city or anything but certainly tasty, filling and the right price. Cash only. I grow up eating vietnamese sandwiches at many places, trust me when I say this place tops them all. It's the lowest priced out of them too. These sandwiches usually contained pickled vegetables and your choice of meat (I chose my favorite, spicy pork) in a harty loaf of bread. It's absolutely delicious and the best part is it's so cheap and huge. For $5.25 you can split a nice sized sandwich with someome else, located in Chinatown Manhattan. Value: 8/10Experience: 8/10Taste: 6/10Great for a quick and cheap banh mi with seating along the wall.Value: I got the BBQ banh mi for $5.25. It was a decently sized sandwich and enough for a smaller meal. You won't find a cheaper banh mi in NY1 (And I'd love to know if you do know a place! ;))Experience: My sandwich was already packed and ready as soon as I ordered so that was a bit weird. The seating areas along the walls were clean and had sriracha bottles placed throughout. It also shares the store with a jewelry store with a fish tank so that's interesting.Taste: Definitely not impressed. The bread was too dry and cut my mouth as I ate it. The BBQ pork was cold and I could tell the sandwich has been laying around for a while. Maybe if it was fresh then it would have tasted better. Xe May Sandwich Shop banh mi's are much better IMO. Their banh mi is the epitome of mediocrity. Can't get a banh mi more average than this. Just kidding, it was actually pretty tasty. The sandwich is not made fresh since they just took one pre-wrapped and gave it to me. It's not as good as the freshly made ones, but it's cheap. I ordered the #1 BBQ Pork Sandwich.  The BBQ pork is almost ground, but the taste is fine and slighly sweet. slightly sweet. The sandwich comes with carrots, radish, cucumber, and pate. When you warm it in the microwave or oven, it tastes much better.The main draw for me is they sell snacks on the side. I found out that they sell this delicious Malaysian brand of mooncakes called Overseas. My dad bought some for me once at a Malaysian restaurant in Edison, NJ, and I have been searching for them since. I'm so happy that I found them here. The mooncake brand has a pandan and mung bean flavor called Golden Starlight. It is the best mooncake I ever had. You can get a box here for $32.I also tried the Bnh B Nuong (Vietnamese honeycomb cake) because I was curious how similar it was to bika ambon. It tastes nothing like bika ambon. It's more stiff and coconuty. I enjoyed it very much though. I didn't buy them, but they also sell these tasty looking mung bean pastries. I'll have to get some next time. Overall, average banh mi, but great place for some delicious Southeast Asian snacks. I was in the area, so I decided to drop by for a quick dinner. I didn't know what I to expect, because when I stepped into the store, there was a jade jeweler at the front with the Banh Mi shop at the back. On the right side, there were a group of Vietnamese employees gathered around a TV sitting on plastic chairs. I was pretty confused; it felt like I was in Asia. The sandwiches were probably pre-made because I was instantly handed my BBQ Pork Banh Mi right when I paid the cashier (this place is cash only).BBQ Pork Banh Mi: filled with daikon, carrots, cucumbers, cilantro, and ground BBQ pork. The bun was toasted and light and the veggies were crisp. The ground BBQ was a little bit sweet, but not overwhelming, and it was pretty fatty. A criticism regarding the sandwich was that it was cold. It probably would've tasted better if the pork was warm and the buns were toasted to order. Overall, this place is pretty good and filling for its price. It's somewhat expensive for a Banh Mi, but it is cheaper than other places in NY. Banh Mi Saigon will probably be my go-to Vietnamese sandwich shop in the city. If you're around the area, or if you're craving a sandwich, I would recommend coming here! I'm planning to come back and try other things on the menu. Looking for a no frills ""Banh-Mi"" shop? Then welcome to Banh Mi Saigon on Grand Street... not familiar? It's right across the street from Nyonya! ;) It's a shared shop with some odd jewelry place (to the left), some counter seatings (to the right) and head straight to the front, queue up, order &amp; pay.   Menu screen-display (right side - look up) and don't forget those daily special inside the ""heated"" containers; pre-made snacks, drinks &amp; a cup of ""flan"" for $2.50! Appropriately priced for Chinatown eats $5-$6, always add an ice cold Viet coffee $2.50! ALWAYS!! Banh Mi - pretty dang good! We got #1 (BBQ pork) and #4 (Viet Ham &amp; Pate) - all comes with the goodies (pickled radish/carrot/cilantro/cucumber). Happy feasting Yelpers!#willtravelforfood The price point and the food quality were both amazing!! My boyfriend and I both got the barbecue pork Banh mi and bamboo/carrot drink, which came out to $12 total. Both items tasted amazingly delicious and the quantity of food was great. I would definitely recommend this place as a mid day snack or cheap meal. So yummy that I regret not finding this place when I lived closer! I tried this spot, because Saigon Vietnamese Sandwich Deli sold out of Banh Mi's. I was not disappointed at all. Clean, quick, and delicious. PS they only accept cash, but there is a Chase down the street. I will absolutely come here again! Since I've made nearly 10 trips here through the spring and summer months, I've become familiar with this spot's robust bnh m sandwiches. They're jam-packed with leafy vegetables and pickled carrots, and the bread is high-quality (crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside). I used to love Banh Mi Saigon's sandwiches, but since their options for vegetarians like me are quite limited, I'm opting for other lunch choices in/around the Chinatown area.That said, their sauted shrimp bnh m is worth a try: after devouring the vegetable add-ons, the best part of this sandwich was tasting the mayonnaise, bread, shrimp and caramelized onions all in one bite. Also, their bnh b nng (green colored chewy sponge cake) is top-notch: I've gotten slices for myself and friends, and they've all raved about it.Monetary transactions here are usually quick, and customer service related to other issues can be a hit or miss: once, I accidentally ordered a sandwich I didn't want and asked for an exchange, and even after I apologized to the staff worker, they continued to look pissed off and didn't give me a reply. There was so much ego and anger in that interaction, and it continues to define the tenuous attitudes that the staff workers can have at the shop. I have been visiting this store for many years before  they relocate to here from a tiny place a block away. It is one of the oldest Vietnamese sandwich shop around Chinatown and maybe even NYC. This is like a ma and pa shop to me. They are always original and their food is always good. I always ordered #1(BBQ pork) on the menus and it has never disappointed me. I ordered the sandwich then 2 to 3 minutes later, it is done. The fast service can always can take care of the long line in a timely matter. That is why I don't mind waiting in long line. The sandwich tastes the best when you just receive it. Why? That is because they just made it and the bread is still crispy instead of later becoming soggy from the vegetables that is inside. The main ingredients inside the roll are one type of protein(meat), cucumber, cilantro, shredded radish (carrot &amp; daikon) and streamed pork roll. You can change what kind of meat you want as well as remove any other ingredients that you don't like. I just like everything on it and sometime I just add hot pepper to spice it up. The price at this place rarely change over the years and that why people like myself come back. This is prefect place, if you want to grab something quick to eat. I will always come back from time to time as long as they are still open. I've been coming here to get my viet sandwich fix. I always get the BBQ pork sandwich (Banh Mi) and honestly it never disappoints me. I always get non spicy even though I love spicy food. For the spicy verison of the sandwich they just put in a jalapeo pepper and make it ""spicy"". I've had other Banh Mi sandwiches at other places where their meat is actually spicy. But overall the sandwich is definitely worth getting, and the prices are reasonable, less than 6 dollars in Chinatown, where else can you get such a deal? Food 7Service 6Atmosphere 6 I'm straight into the 2nd half of my sando 5 hours later and it's just so good....still!!!!  Flavorful and yuuuuuuuumm meeeee!!!!  I don't always crave the bahn mi, however I am always pretty happy and satisfied that I got it. My style is the #4 wif double the meats.  Both the pate and the pork roll dubbed up is the way to go if ya ask me.  Straight up satisfying is what it is.  I get both my easy eating sando craving AND asian taste profile satisfied. This place is my go-to spot for my banh mi needs. I usually get the #1 (bbq pork banh mi) or the curry chicken banh mi. You can order it spicy or non-spicy (for those of you who like the heat, they do bring it). During the lunch rush, they usually have #1's pre-made minutes in advance, so you can get a fresh sandwich in a hurry. They're priced well and they don't skimp on the meat or the cilantro/carrots/radishes. They also have good summer rolls that can suffice as an entire meal, too. Also like their spring rolls and the fish sauce that comes with it (they make their own and it's not overly fishy like most fish sauces that come with spring rolls).There's a jewelry kiosk randomly placed to the side of the restaurant, but who cares, this place is one of my favorite lunch places in Chinatown. A good ""change of pace"" kind of lunch when you want something cheap and quick but you're not in the mood for Chinese food that day. Overall, just a solid place. Will continue coming again and again~ [Note: cash only, be prepared to order since the line moves quick]Currently #1 on my list of banh mi places in NYC! You really can't beat their portion size and $5.25 price for their signature Banh Mi Saigon, with ground bbq pork as the main meat.Disclaimer: Their Bun Nem Nuong is made with the same bbq pork, which suffice to say isn't the typical texture you'd get at a Vietnamese restaurant, but it's still pretty good and filling.This place also stocks Cha Lua and Cha Hue, so if you're missing mama's meatloaves you can get 'em here! It took 10 seconds to walk across the hall and jewelry stand, look at the menu, and choose #1 item (BBQ pork). Soft spoken man behind the counter asked, ""spicy or no spicy?"" I said spicy. He did a wide spin, grabbing a brown bag and something else, and returned with my lunch ($5.25, cash). I was in and out in 30 seconds. If you want to eat there, there are some high tops and AC. My spicy BBQ pork was *spicy*. There are chunks of jalapeo (or some other spicy pepper) with spicy sauce. I had half for lunch and the other half 4 hours later - plenty of food!",https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0qDco8FqOZ47wb3GYOUYlg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pCkbZfyyShP9D3LJOkCxPQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3-Mhh0O4dAzUdm6xiuaa4w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GHjPbM72rSxnDIh3bLeZQA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/r25OgRhr69vfGP8i7UjPtw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8SpP2XMsFbGiIUtEzboskw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hsfuDVsoEDZHaEjofzPDag/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/D0lZK2TAKIeodsZ_IKH-3g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/G5rO9Dnw8gPgCISSVR1-OQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vgqqiPPrIaRXdx1p4Bq48A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yCZ__jHoodmTNviPSjJhPw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PIMDcu2oFGls2izhDeRLYg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Egg5P-swEmWIJbt9pnwRdQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/crLe8EvkdYNuNl2e4XIpOQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xwzxjEoH7ojMTpVpge4CWQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rH_fyi0wPobaEqMDKkX1Eg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gqq4TWUiiTaFOcRkgvNRjQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/me6UHoUepNtLHiuSMr2JvQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bV7FunK4SjwSeeuqo05wyg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/eMsEyF_DmGo6tmCGiTCOgQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/M3DDQNgwX-dHOREcix6n1g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8fQONLPT9eBLJ7SULu28XQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7Vg-TBcTmbFmQuValRzh9w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zEkusC7JWnDcN-KhBVg01w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4zIegIdOmoDaQd5yPNHVfA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VSZyv8fSMpk_hnW_BY44pA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gwTEMxgp6xfwwAA4LD-Trw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JpOHG1WtMCxYuLEBmB7xjw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VKkf2Aom9Ivx9PUEWcCnIw/258s.jpg,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/barrio-chino-new-york,barrio-chino-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Mexican,Bars,NA,"Friggin' love this place! I'm from the Bay Area and hadn't found Mexican food that even remotely resembled food from back home -- until BC.You must get the guacamole and the soups are really yummy. I always get the carne asada tacos and, though they are small, it's enough food for me.The spicy margaritas will knock you on your ass they are excellent. Located on the fringe of LES and Chinatown lives Barrio Chino, a Mexican restaurant inspired by their neighbors in Chinatown. The small and unassuming restaurant is well known for its margaritas and on a Thursday night, the full and bustling restaurant was filled with diners drinking margs, eating tacos and chips and guacamole. My friend and I were able to snag a bar seat and we shared 3 orders of tacos (each order of tacos comes with 2 for $9). All tacos are served on Chinese inspired plates, creating a beautiful blending of cultures and also showing appreciation for the neighborhood. My favorite tacos were the steak and least favorite were the cactus. I would definitely visit Barrio Chino again for a meal. This is not a great restaurant for large groups however, as its noisy and loud. This place is a little hard to find but it's white with no signs. I was craving some tacos and decided to come here at 9:55 a.m. and asked if they were opened at 10:00 like what the Yelp page says.. but they told me that they open at 10:30 a.m... Pescado ($12)- 3/5 They give you 2 sad looking tacos that come with some mango and onions. Without the guacamole that I paid $4 for, it would have tasted really depressing. It's a tad bit sour. Anyways they do give you a bunch of sauce inside the container, which I think is just filler..I don't know if I would spend $17 on 2 tacos though. As good as it gets, really! Great drinks, great food, an amazing staff, and a cool atmosphere. I recently went to Barrio for the 5th time, and a review of this place has been a long coming for sure. On this particular visit, it was New Year's Eve, so the plan was to come for drinks and dinner and stay for the later night festivities (on weekends they sometimes push the tables away, build a makeshift dance floor, and feature talented DJs). As expected, everything about the night was spot on! Continue reading for some highlights.FOOD - I got the chicken verde enchiladas AGAIN; these rule so much that I've had them a few times! Definitely worth it! Other stand outs I've tried include the tacos (all are good), the quesadilla, and their soups (again, all are good).DRINKS - Get the grapefruit margarita! You can't go wrong! It comes with a sugar rim, which I'm not a fan of so I always sub for salt! Soooooo tasty (and strong)!!SERVICE - From wait staff to bartender to late night DJ--always great service all around!This place is very small and often crowded, but the wait is definitely worth it if you have the time. Just have a couple of drinks and wait for a table! You'll be glad you did! Such a great little mexican spot in my opinion. Their tacos are amazing and so is the spicy margarita. The atmosphere is loud, trendy and fun. Good spot to bring out of town friends or going on a date.Every time I've come, the wait has ended up being shorter than they estimate, which is always a nice surprise. Easy enough to grab a drink at a nearby bar while you wait! I probably would rather insist on giving a 2.5/5 review but the extra half doesn't hurt anyone I suppose.The service is just ok.  Even on a Sunday night, nearly every seat was filled until almost 10pm.  So maybe the service couldn't keep up but it definitely wasn't the easiest thing in the world to get some help with our order being seated at the bar - I recall there being just one bartender to do drinks and bring food out to bar seats.Two tacos come for $9 which some might say isn't the worst thing in the world but they were small, not very tasty, and a tad disappointing.The enchilada plate offered a little more substance but I don't think I was able to taste anything beneath the plow of beans.Meh. What a beautiful restaurant. I came for a weekend lunch with a friend at 1p, walked right in without a reservation. There were several empty tables that stayed empty throughout our time there. Maybe it was the time of the day and how the sun shined brightly in its large storefront windows, or maybe it was the lack of people and the ability to talk intimately with a friend... In any case, I had a wonderful experience there. The food was delicious. Although it was brunch, there were plenty of non-brunchy items. I would recommend to get another small dish with the tacos - they're small. We ordered guacamole to split, which was perfect. One negative note -- our server grew impatient as we ended our meal. We wanted to linger and chat without forks in our mouths. The server first asked if everything was ok, then asked if we wanted something else, then asked if we wanted dessert, then asked if we were ok (again).I am coming back next weekend! Great drinks, nice neighborhood and good vibes! So definitely a few things to like about this place. Unfortunately the food is not one of them. Although the guac was ok, I am frankly baffled that anybody would serve those flavorless, greasy, hard as bricks chips. The salsa was chock full of smokey ancho chili. Different, but not good. The mole sauce on my chicken was grainy with an unpleasant texture and so sweet it hardly qualifies as savory. A good mole should be complex yet balanced and deep in flavors. The fish tacos (mahi mahi) was pretty good and I would come back for drinks! Being from San Diego I grew up eating next levelMexican food, Barrio Chino is the closest to SD Mexican food the steak tacos and chicken verde enchiladas are fire also the barbraco is really good! Never disappointed with the food or drinks.  The only thing I would like to change is they don't except cash it card only so don't forget your debit/CC card. If you have mole... I am coming for you. That isn't a cute name for guacamole. Guacamole's cute name is guac. This place has mole poblano (if I had to guess what type it is) so despite the worst rainfall in New York history that cinco de mayo. I came, I searched, I conquered!We kept it simple here, I really only wanted the mole, so I got that with a side of rice. Little fun fact about me I lived in Chiapas Mexico for 2 years and one of the biggest comfort foods for me was rice and mole. Though often served with chicken there, I just liked the mole and the rice. Something that tasted good and filled me up.The mole was borderline great. Definitely good, but nothing exceptional about it. The best mole I have had post my time living in Mexico is still in Salt Lake City Utah... which is crazy. This mole was the perfect mix of sweet and savory. I had two enchiladas with them and they were very filling. Perfectly cooked chicken. More importantly perfectly cooked rice.The to the sheppard tacos were also good not great but also took me back to the good ole days in chiapas. Perfectly topped with white onion cilantro and pineapple, and gave me one last nostalgic bite.The coconut flan, ended our experience and... take the coconut off. That is my only suggestion. The flan was easily the best of the three things we had. Perfect custard consistency, perfect flavor... and then... the stupid crunchy coconut. I like coconut but this dish was trying to do too much. THE VERDICT:Go try this place once. That is about the total number of times that you need to go here. Get a feel for the ambiance and the flavors of mexico. Also... they have a pretty awesome name, Barrio Chino or... Chinatown. Which is kind of near where we ate. Well played BC well played. However, I cannot say that I will be returning to this place ever... nevertheless a delicious meal, but nothing special. Came in for lunch on a weekday and there were plenty of seats available. I really dislike when I walk into a restaurant and no one is there to welcome me. You just stand there....do I just grab any seat? Or do I wait for someone? Don't want to disrespect the host if there is a host, right? Granted the Brianna ? Was working the whole place by herself, I was finally greeted and took my seat. Here's the breakdown:Vibe - typical LES, chill, casual with hipster music - go figure. Drinks - I ordered the hibiscus tea which was very tart but refreshing. Give it a try if you want but it's not a must. Food - I ended up getting the verde enchiladas. Basically a green sauce with 2 enchiladas, some beans and cheese. Oh and 2 pieces of tortilla chips. I devoured the whole plate, so it wasn't bad but it's not mind blowing. I forgot to mention that it took about 20+ minutes to get my food and it wasn't busy. Maybe that's the norm? But it felt long to me. I would go back a 2nd time to try them out again but this 1st visit didn't leave an impression. Arrived at around 5:45PM, just before the peak of dinner time. Shortly after we arrived, the restaurant did get pretty crowded and there was a wait time, as the place is not that big. Sadly, they don't have any happy hour specials. To start, we got a Watermelon and Classic Margarita. Both were so refreshing and they were definitely generous with the alcohol! To pair, we got guac and chips; the guac was seasoned really well and I loved the saltiness of the chips. Because we weren't that hungry, we just got Ceviche and an order of the Al Pastor Tacos. The ceviche also comes with chips, and I loved the tanginess of it all; though I would've been happier if there was more fish in it. The Al Pastor tacos were seasoned beautifully, the pork was nice and tender, and the pineapple added the perfect sweetness to it. To conclude, we got another round of drinks, I got a Hibiscus Margarita and my friend got a Coconut Mojito. The mojito was on the lighter side, while the margarita was still really strong and had a sourness to it. Overall, it was a great dinner, though I would prefer happy hour specials, because the drinks do get expensive, ranging from $10-12 a drink. I was here about a month or two ago with a friend. The space was very small and crowded. We didn't have a reservation(I also don't think they take reservations), we just walked in and thankfully got a table. I had a glass of white wine which was very nice and complimented my fish taco dish. This fish taco was everything. It was so good I ordered another one right after I finished the first one. If I was in the LES area and looking for something to eat, it would be the first place that comes to mind just because that fish taco was so good and pretty reasonably priced. I pass Barrio Chino on a weekly basis and have wanted to try it for dinner for some time now.  The BF &amp; I went there last Thursday night.  Ambiance was lovely for a date night on the LES and the wait wasn't too bad either.Food was really yummy - had a homemade charm to it and didn't taste overly salty.  We started with the ceviche which was served in a fun sundae-esque glass with two long spoons and tortilla chips.  Flavors were on point - just wish there was more seafood in it!  We then shared two orders of tacos - one Pescado and one Arrachera.  Both were pretty good (tough because we're die hard fans of Los Tacos and Los Mariscos in Chelsea Market).  And finally, the Enchiladas Verdes which were really really good.  Would definitely come back for those enchiladas! Great atmosphere for dinner and drinks. The dining room is very small, so I was very skeptical when my party of four walked up on a Saturday at 8 and were told would have a table in less than 15 minutes. Well, we barely had time to finish a drink down the street when we got the call saying the table was ready. Once in we were treated to very good drinks - the strawberry vanilla marg really is as good as other reviewers have described, it has a fresh strawberry taste as opposed to an artificial syrup flavoring. The food was very good as well. The menu is small but carefully selected. Highlights were guacamole and tacos al pastor. The rice was also cooked perfectly. LOVE this place. The food is amazing. Came here for dinner and gets a bit crowded and it is pretty cramped. However, the food really made up for the spacing issue. Their guac is fresh and tasty. Margaritas were also at a great price and delicious! Great great food.The ceviche was my absolute favorite! The staff is friendly! Always packed! This is not your have a deep conversation kinda place as they pump up the music :-))) Great fun and great food! And they do lunch, dinner and brunch! Highly recommended! Barrio Chino is tiny! Keep that in mind when you stroll in with your huge Canada Goose jacket. We split guacamole, enchiladas, and soup. It was delicious! I would definitely recommend coming to dine here. The service is a little bit slow but overall a good experience. First off, I do want to say the drinks were good and the server was really hospitable and professional. Our negative experience mainly stems from these two very rude waitresses. Throughout our night, they were very insistent on kicking us out of our table.They really hit the final straw when one of the waitresses comes to our table and asks us to get out of our table to make space for people who were going to eat dinner. Normally, I would not be annoyed by that request, albeit a rude one, but the context of the situation was absolutely absurd. Other people in the restaurants were sitting down, without food on their tables and without drinks. She comes to our table, once we had all ordered a round of drinks for our table---drinks, which in all honesty are probably more expensive than any of the food those people were going to order. She asks us to take our drinks and sit on a window ledge near the corner of the restaurant. In other words, she was asking us to take out drinks outside. This was rude beyond comprehension. Again, the server was great and so were the food and drinks, but the service from these waitresses definitely needs some correcting from management. Cozy, dark and tight. It's a double date kind of place not a group hangout. No happy hour. Their cocktails are great! There's multiple selections of mojitos, margaritas and beers. I personally liked the dark rum mojito and their habenero grapefruit Margarita was pretty cool! It has a nice heat to your cold cocktail. Food wise i had their taco platter with a little of everything:  steak, chorizo, cactus salad and guacamole.  I thought their steak was very salty but everyone else i was with loved it. The chorizo was ok and the cactus salad was gross.  Haha...Their chicken tacos were better, not as salty and some hot sauce really helped. Next time i would skip the tacos. Come hungry and order enchiladas or something hearty.",https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8PdXnElPeE7PVXLDuU6lKg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BTZlphTk1adV11c3GD245A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jtCvpUNeAK7FqbUY9d6GzQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/d2WhgevC6vMbHWsQCHmVjA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jqsjOhxcrcJYQr__mM7UZA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6PNRXmdH4nEnuFbcINHO9Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6N5bQ3yT2rupnT8Har0EtQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/al6PCDy-fxl_HvchXDUiGw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/60BWeq44ntkeZBY-05y6Ww/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/F8oZQgf0KikrSfK99BSh5g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fKLBsKmukcHQzPlaaZerZQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/L4TcnslPCGnqX9uVq1XUsQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yLlWVxsX9m6r-4X_nbBGnQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2-n-5tWfPrJ1SIjG5uV_2A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tz5Tk3g84vkzyZyxi7S3vw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BONYVT1d8p6QDTQEcnt33w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QWop7pwhSSaoZ2rsstDb_Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wf3Qo7UYh6PSmMKh3ZbpEw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PJLoK1VPvib873FKuug1ng/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SqI0ADHczasiQcWEEC3OiA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JHyi4Fx59DjCxznZPeJk8w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jzmMV0xsKE68ZB5eYJaxHw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Sjx8rDTxLBiDgJtHRZFmiQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4NhdMGgTA8GInmESAlkLMw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WBldPO0soPSE-CjCXWxXZQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6lRMH6K0Hq80eV6aUOn-BQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UQUKCHKgm-jR40bizvefRg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lnrvCYaf48siUV7yPtrFgQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dlPEa1Kqk8AnkvD20VuFZA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VW8sRc7zkLjwfOabHty8ag/258s.jpg
https://www.yelp.com//biz/beauty-and-essex-new-york,beauty-and-essex-new-york,New York,10002,NY,American (New),NA,NA,"Came here for my birthday dinner w my best friends and we had such a good time. Definitely need to make rsvps especially for dinner time! The decor is so unique, vintage and pretty! Yes, the front entrance appears like a pawn shop for necklaces. Once u enter, there is the bathroom downstairs (ladies restroom serves champagne by the glass!) and coatchecks. Im not sure whats in the ground floor level room but i think its a bar? We were seated upstairs where there was also a bar area with room for dancing.I drank ""beauty elixir"" pretty much for the whole night. Even got one on the house cos it came late (after the check). We ordered some appetizers and entrees to share. I definitely would recommend the bone marrow, lobster mac n cheese, and the devils cake!We had the steak, tuna w soba noodles (the soba noodles were served cold w a vinegar taste, not quite what im used to but tuna was good!) and lemon chicken.We enjoyed dinner here and i know i'll definitely come back again to try more items! TLDR: Upscale place for tapas at fairly high prices. Reserve in advance. Best dishes are lemon pancakes, grilled cheese dumplings, and short rib huevos rancheros! Overall rating: A-For first timers, here's how you get in: Walk through the pawn shop and head to the big door in the back in the left corner. Open it and head into the secret sanctuary. Dress up a bit. It's pretty fancy in here. It's hard to get a reservation. You need to make it well in advance to get your pick of times. Especially for brunch. I went here for my birthday brunch this year with 3 friends. I made a reservation a month in advance for Saturday at 1:30pm. Make sure you get there on time. They generally can't accommodate late parties. They will hold your table for about 15 minutes. It's beautiful inside. The ladies lounge downstairs includes complimentary prosecco during dinner hours only I think! It wasn't available during brunch. Make sure you bring singles for tip! You don't want to be THAT person! There were mostly women brunching when we went. A lot of them were very dressy. There's a big skylight in the center. They need more air conditioning though. It was pretty warm in there. It was 50 degrees outside that day. They suggest 6-8 small tapas dishes for a party of 4. We got 6 dishes. We were way too full. We will get only 5 dishes next time. We had 3 light eaters and 1 person with a big appetite. Most dishes seem to serve 3 but they'll ask if you want the portions to feed 4 or however big your party is (which means additional charges of course). The service is pretty good. They bring you out a couple dishes at a time. It took us about 2 hours to finish our meal.  The sixth dish took much longer to come out. Make sure you save up. This is a pretty expensive restaurant. Onto the food:-LEMON BLACKBERRY PANCAKES (sweet ricotta cream): Full sized large pancakes! So good and fluffy! Not too sweet. Also served with syrup if you prefer added sweetness. Not much fruit in the pancakes though. I think I just got one blackberry in the center. I'd love a couple more blackberries dispersed throughout the pancakes. We received 4 pancakes. A-GRILLED CHEESE, SMOKED BACON &amp; TOMATO SOUP DUMPLINGS: Imagine a dumpling filled with cheese and topped with bacon crumbles sitting in a big spoon full of thick slightly spicy tomato soup. Perfection!! We received 6 dumplings, which is not easily divisible for 4 people though. A+-BRAISED SHORT RIB 'HUEVOS RANCHEROS'(sunny side up eggs, black beans, cotija): 2 inch wide fried wonton cup filled with  delicious braised short rib, cotija, and each topped with a sunny side up egg. This sits atop a delicious red sauce and black bean puree. Amazing! We received 4. A+-RED VELVET WAFFLES(cream cheese icing): Cute tiny mini waffles. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The cream cheese icing is very sweet. I got this in place of dessert. We received 4. B+-FREE RANGE SCRAMBLED EGGS(smoked salmon, boursin cheese, chives): I hate seafood. This was no exception. I hear cooking smoked fish makes it stink. We received 4. I took a tiny bite and it was horrible! For me, the salmon ruined the dish. F--FRIED CHICKEN BISCUIT BITES (tabasco honey butter, red cabbage slaw): This came out after a long wait. I think the kitchen was backed up from the larger parties. We received 4. They're mini sandwiches. The chicken had too much breading and overall bland. Weird sweet butter. Skip! D-RISE N' SHINEcocktail (stoli vanil, cold brew coffee, coconut milk, vanilla, aztec chocolate bitters): Tastes like a spiked Vietnamese iced coffee! Yum! AI'd definitely come back here for a special occasion. It was really fun! So basic it hurts. Between the carding at the bathroom door (...for obvious reasons) and the ridiculously overpriced and oversalted food, this place just isn't worth it. I get that many people come here because it's ""the place to be"" but the crowd is just such a turnoff. Portions were resized appropriate for our group but this just meant that everyone way overpaid for what are already very expensive apps and entrees. Additionaly, we were here for a surprise bday party and the hostess(es) told us they couldn't seat us until the full party was here. ...I get that, I really do, but from a customer management point of view, and in light of the fact that it was a surprise bday dinner, they could've at least seated us when the majority of the party was there (which we tried to ask for but were ultimately denied). When we finally got them to seat us with a *gasp* two people (the bday boy and his fiance) still missing, the hostess's exact words were ""Ok but you have to order as soon as you sit down.""...Um. Screw that. Pass on this place please. It's not worth it. Everything about our trip to Beauty &amp; Essex was a fantastic experience! As mentioned in other reviews, the entrance is low-key, but opens to a beautiful and classy space that really makes you feel like you're in Vegas or somewhere like it. We had a short initial wait (it was me and 5 other girls for a bachelorette party) but we entertained ourselves at the bar while chill but club like beats played in the background.After grabbing a drink to start (and finding out there is a BAR in the bathroom offering complimentary champagne), we were seated. Our waiter, Ryan, was fantastic, fun, and patient. He recommended several tapas sized plates and a round of drinks (I do recommend the Beauty Elixir) and we were not disappointed. My personal favorite was the kale salad (sounds basic - but it was really good), the shrimp, and the fish tacos.We had such a good time, we even went back to the bar area to hang out for a while more after dinner! I came here with high expectations based on recommendations and prior reviews. With that being said, my expectations were almost all met, which is saying a lot. Warning- prices are high! Ambiance:The highlight of the visit here was the ambiance. I was in search for a hip, trendy spot with great food and this place fit the bill perfectly. You enter into a pawn shop and the door opens into the restaurant, a large dimly lit elaborate space with an upstairs and downstairs. We were told there would be live music but it was nowhere to be heard, but the upscale, trendy vibe of this place made up for it. Service: We had reservations and were given a beeper to wait by the bar, no big deal. We only waited 5 minutes and didn't get to order drinks, which is a plus because we shouldn't have to wait long with reservations. We were taken to a table in the main dining room, and our server was ok. She seemed to be in a bad mood or just didn't like us because she was super chatty with the tables next to us. On the brighter side, the way the staff helps each other is impressive. A new person was bringing dishes/drinks out and refilling our water each time, and was super polite. Food:I was really impressed with the food. We just got apps and tried a few items. I would save room for dessert. I tried the tomato soup dumplings (5/5 must order), shishito peppers (4.5/5) and the tuna tartare (4.5/5)For dessert we shared the butterscotch pot de creme (4/5) which was nice but not my favorite- my favorite item from the entire night was the White Russian dessert milkshake! (5/5) Definitely order that- it's very sweet and indulgent.Drink:Beauty Elixr is a great drink although it is not very strong. I could barely taste the alcohol but I guess that's the whole point. On the other hand, the fat Frenchman and ODB are very potent. Proceed with caution lol Overall:I would return again mainly for the ambiance and to try a few new dishes. I guess the service is a hit or miss but this is a great place to grab drinks or have a nice night out. The service was amazing. Fav spot in soho New York!This place is adorable inside. Food was amazing. The waitress made great recommendations and was so helpful. My friend ordered a drink and was not happy with it, and they replaced it 3 times until she was happy!! Good portions, definitely recommend there grilled cheese soup dumplings Last night was one of the most amazing tapa dinners ever. After walking into the pawn shop and drooling over the Gibson 335 and several Les Pauls, we entered the restaurant through ""the door"" in the pawn shop.  It is the most unique entrance second to one in Atlanta where you walk through a bakery to get to the restaurant.Our reservations were at 8:30 and we did not get seated until 9:30!  Now I was pretty fuming at this point as we were told another group paid but was not leaving the table. It happens but I was surprised nothing was being done to accommodate us for the wait.  Well they definitely took care of us after we were seated.  Complimentary sparkling for the table (4 of us) was a nice way to accomodate.However after we ordered, they added several items on the house and integrated them in with our dishes. Now that is what I call EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE.The wait staff were great and now for the big review!All items were tapas, one piece per person. There are main dishes but why anyone would want one big dish and not explore all the flavors of the chef's creations is beyond me.We had:ThaiShrimp- an amazing very lightly breaded large prawns which were full of sweetness and heat from the red peppers and some sort of sliced root that accompanied the dish.  Shrimp very fresh with a nice snap to them, Definitely a must dish.Avacado Toast- ok the new frozen yogurt rage of the 90s is now Avacado toast rage of 2017. Although it's really a chinky guacamole that was very tasty there was nothing really creative about mashed avocado on toast but it was tasty. Salmon Tar Tare Toast- amazing combination of flavors on this dish and nice presentation, I always love a great tar tare of anything and this did not disappoint.Mini Tuna Taco- was a great mini taco stuffed with ahi tuna and a wasabi cream. Excellent and a must get.Crab Rangoon- a real classic served on an asian style rice puff crackerCeaaer Toast- a unique twist on individual toasts. The salad was great, dressed perfectly.Empanada- very good. a mini serving in a nice crisp and light pouch of fried dough.Bulgogi tacos,- one of my favorites with great moist, juicy sweet bulgogi meat server in the same taco as the mini tuna tacos. Excellent!Tomato Soup Dumpling- a great spin served in a wonton soup spoon filled with tomato soup and a nice quarter size dumpling floating on top. This was a fun dish and I loved the presentation.Lobster Mac and Cheese- omg so good with massive size pieces of lobster and cheese throughout with large pieces of pasta.Shishito peppers. Done in a very unique sweet and spicy sauce that really gave extraordinary flavor to what is usually a fairly bland pepper with a surprise hot one at random that makes eating them a fun time.All in all this is one of THE places to go in NYC and I will come back here for sure on my next visit next year.5 stars and then some!Tip: The music is loud, the crowd is loud, so drink well and often so you don't care. I was making last minute arrangements couple weeks ago to celebrate an engagement with some friends. The reason that it was last minute is because the guest of honor commented that the other place was too far (*insert eye roll*). I was nervous that I could not find a nice replacement so last minute, but I took my chances and they had a last minute reservation at 5:15 on a Friday, so we jumped on it.When you first walk in, you will see a gift shop, and the restaurant is behind that. They were quick to seat us, and had a complementary coat check. The restaurant is really pretty and grand, and the ladies restrooms were very clean and had a royal feel (bathroom attendant, supplies and all). Beauty and Essex has the perfect date-night feel.We were a group of three and we ordered the following to share:-Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos -Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon &amp; Tomato Soup Dumplings-Chocolate Peanut Butter Whoopie -""Les, NYC"" Doughnuts-Beauty &amp; Essex Burger w/ crispy bbq fries-Braised Short Ribs-Beauty Elixir (gin, cucumber, strawberry, sparkling ros) for me.The appetizers and the entrees were solid choices, but nothing stood out more than the desserts and the beauty elixir drink. They were my favorite parts of the entire experience! the drink is fruity, but not overwhelmingly sweet and is mixed very well. The desserts were both a very solid choice (but I would suggest sharing between two people vs. three if you have a true sweet tooth). This was overall a wonderful experience, and cost us about $150. I would say that it was completely worth it in terms of dining experiences in NYC and is definitely worth the try! First Impression- I decided to have my birthday dinner here, an intimate date with just my boyfriend and I on a Friday night. Upon arrival, we're greeted by a doorman and passed what seemed to be a line....or just a couple of stragglers. He asked if we had reservations and directed us through the pawn shop once we informed him that we did. Many reviews state how sketchy and unassuming the front of the restaurant is. How unassuming can a big ass storefront sign fitted with neon lights that blare ""Beauty &amp; Essex"" be? I'll never know. We walked through the pawn shop and opened the doors to the most immaculate dining establishment ever. Gorgeous decor, illuminating fixtures. If beautiful people are eye candy, B&amp;E is a goddamn candy shop. This restaurant is apart of the Tao Group, so the decor in some ways is reminiscent of Tao and Vandal, with its own unique appeal of course. Dim lights and clubby music seem to be the preferred ambiance for trendy restaurants nowadays. An elaborate chandelier centered inside of a luxe spiraled staircase makes for beautiful photo ops and after dinner I seized the opportunity. Dining here makes you feel so fucking classy.Service-Here's where stars begin to come off. The hostess led us through the beautiful and pretentious crowd laced in their Sunday's best and seated us in a large booth where we waited for our server. And waited....and waited. It was 20 minutes before our server acknowledged us. I spotted him walking across the dining hall and we locked eyes; this prompted him to approach us. He greets us. His name is Santiago. He asked for our drink order, but being that we'd already waited I gave him our entire order. Despite our wait, we were very friendly. From the beginning, Santiago seemed disconnected and kind of cold. We order the grilled cheese and tomato soup dumplings, the seafood tower and the Essex burger.  We had two cocktails; the Beauty Elixir and another savory drink I can't recall. I asked him about the lobster Mac and cheese and he recommended it. My boyfriend chimes in and says he would like one as well.  Santiago proceeds to say, ""Two orders? Oh, you must be rich."" Wait,....what? I rolled my eyes so hard I could see the back of my head. I don't walk around with a stick up my ass and I'm not easily offended. His comment just seemed super inappropriate and not made in jest, mostly because he didn't seem welcoming to begin with. He disappeared the rest of the night checking on our table only once after we received our food. I wanted another cocktail but our phantom server was m.i.a. After our dinner was finished we waited around another 20 mins for the check. My boyfriend reminded him it was my bday (we mentioned this earlier). He came out with a candle and a cake pop. Food-Grilled cheese dumplings were amazing and the best dish we'd had. We immediately wanted another order. Seafood tower was as expected, fresh oysters, little neck clams, etc. Lobster Mac and cheese was average. They drown it in breadcrumbs which detracts from the flavor. Not recommended. Cocktails were delicious and strong.Conclusion-Service was slightly disappointing though the restaurant is everything and more. All in all I'd definitely come back. It's best to come with friends imo, as the clubby music, upstairs lounge and small plates seem more appropriate. It's paradoxically superficial with substance, because the food is actually great. Expensive? Yes. Potential to be pretentious depending on the night? Yes. But is the food, decor, and wait staff exceptional? Yes.Came on a Monday night at 7pm for dinner and drinks so I cant attest to the clubby atmosphere or what it's like as part of your Friday night out but the food is pretty scrumptious. Started out with cocktails- Beauty Rlixir and Berry Mojito. For the price they honestly were nothing exciting. Both a little too sweet but not unbearable. By the taste they should have been 10-12 but they can afford to up the price here because of the atmosphere. On to the food:-Crab Rangoons: only 3 small bites BUT delicious. Think deconstructed though, not deep fried wonton pouches.-Bone Marrow: LARGE portion. Two long bones with a stack of toasted bread and onion jam. Could not finish it. Good to share for more than 2 people.-Caesar Salad: most underwhelming item. Could not taste the anchovy, needed more salt or something.-Grilled cheese dumplings: OMG I AM STILL DREAMING/DROOLING OVER THESE LITTLE SPOONS OF HEAVEN. Comes with 6. -Scallops over farrow: Flavor wise I def recommend. Although $36 for 3 is a bit steep. Didn't have room for dessert...okay I lied we just got ice cream at Morgensterns...but the table next to ours had dessert and it looked good. Maybe just not $14 for a slice of something good. Worth it if you're trying to impress or a girls night! I am torn with this review and feel like my 2017 experience deserves 3.5 stars vs my 2010 (or 11) experience which deserved 5.We came here about 7 years ago when the restaurant was new and absolutely loved it - from the vibe and music to the extensive menu options to the cool decor!  (Oh and the food was tasty)Today... 7 years later....It's looking a little run down. Our table was really beat up.  They need a remodel.The music is now a kick back to the 80s vs the club vibe of the past.The menu as been reduced and isn't as creative.But, the food tasted fine.  The portions aren't big for the price - but I guess we are in NYC.  Overall, I left a little sad and won't be coming back unless they reinvent themselves. My boyfriend and I came here with a gift certificate.  Making a reservation here for prime-time is a pain in the a$$ -- you can only make reservations on Opentable 30 days out and of course as soon as it opens the reservations are scooped up.  We settled with a 9:45pm reservation on a Friday night.  I was surprised no one called me to confirm the reservation the night before/day of so I called.  While I had them on the phone I asked if there was earlier availability and there was not.  We gave ourselves extra time to get there because of inclement weather and street parking, but ended up arriving early.  We checked in and expected to get a drink, but at 9:25pm they were magically able to seat us. Also surprisingly, no one asked to check our coats so the waitress kindly did it for us after we were seated.  We weren't feeling the love for a bit as we saw employees whizzing around without anyone stopping to offer us water or taking our drink order.  I digress, let's get to the food.  We started off with the grilled cheese dumplings which were easily the highlight of the meal, like wow, we should have ordered two of them!  The tuna tacos were also very good, but the wonton shells were heavily fried and had an oily flavor to them.  The lobster mac n cheese was pretty good, but I'm a purist and the breaded topping was a buzzkill.  The bulgogi tacos were also good, same comment about the wonton shells. The crab rangoon was nothing to write home about and I wouldn't recommend it.  The fried shrimp came heavily recommended from the waitress but we didn't think it was anything special, I also wouldn't recommend it.  The ambiance is dimly lit, fun, trendy, with current music playing and plenty of interesting patrons to people watch. It's kind of like if a club and a restaurant had a love child. If someone is visiting town or you're planning a fun night out with a group of people this would be a fun place to come. If you have not been here comeHere ASAP! I came here on a night out with some of my old friends that i haven't seen in a while. This Not was a speakeasy night and Beauty and Essex was on our list of sexy speakeasys to hit up ! Upon entrance, the outside is super shady, you literally feel like you're entering a pawn shop in a shutdown street in Vegas haha ! When you walk in you're greeted by someone who is too dressed up to work in a pawn shop !  Then she tells you you can shop or enter , there isn't a line tonight ! Can i just say - my friends and I walked in laughing . And wow!When we walked in there were two y'all body guards all suited up. Inside looked like you entered the nightclub at Great Gatsby's mansion! Dimly lit with candle like lights  and chandeliers. The hosts at the table were very nice. You must dress up when you come here ! You will definitely be singled out if you don't! My girls and i got a few cocktails  and the delicious dessert shots ! Our waitress was super friendly and nice ! Girls- BTW! You'll love it when you enter the bathroom. Honestly you can just hangout in the bathroom . They had champagne for us in the restrooms, and all the girl amenities that you'd need: body mist, deodorant, hairspray, dry shampoo, baby powder, face wipes, and cream/ body lotion. Plus they even had a lady that handed you a dry napkin to dry your hands after you washed them in the ultimate sink and layout plan of the restroom! Omg ! I strongly recommend a cute surprise date here or a GNO!!! 1/5/2018 - 8:00 pm reservation. What started off as a not so great evening, quickly turned around. I had called a few days in advance to make a reservation for Friday and had specifically requested a more intimate table (booth) as my boyfriend and I were celebrating our 5 year anniversary &amp; did not want to be crammed in a tight space in other people's conversations. We're not local to this area but we quickly discovered that the spacing in New York is very tight. Upon our arrival, we were told if we waited longer we could be seated at a booth. We waited about 25 minutes and was finally seated to a TIGHT spaced table. I was very clearly upset but our server, Eva (Yvette) was SO unbelievably kind and attentive. The service we received from her was unbelievable and had completely turned the night around. 5 Stars for the following: 1. Service was outstanding. Eva, you were amazing and I can't thank you enough. I hope this restaurant recognizes employees like you. 2. Food was great! Kind of small plate but everything had great flavor. If you have a sweet tooth, I highly recommend the donuts! 3. Despite the tight space, the environment is cool. Dim lighting and lounge vibes.*1 star lost for the host who was SO rude. She kept interrupting me and completely disregarded the occasion that night. I would definitely return but not for a special occasion. I think my party &amp; I fell into a salt coma after coming here. The food is obviously overpriced and small. The bill was $100 for 4 smallish dishes and was really just okay. They did give complimentary soup, which was great for the winter time and my cousin loved it. Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos ($18)- 5/5 This was the best dish we had for the night. They give you 3 small little tacos but they tasted so fresh and delicious. I should have savored it more, thinking back about it now. Surf N' Turf ($35)-3/5 This dish had 2 pieces of scallops and 2 pieces of pork belly. The scallops were so salty I felt like they came right out the sea. And according to my sister/cousin the pork belly wasn't anything special. The best thing about this dish is that the pure was very delicious. P.S. the peppers on the ""salad"" was very spicy... that my cousin needed a glass of milk. Spaghettini ($22)- 3/5 This was way too lemony to the point that it hurt our tongues. The lemon flavor took away the parley pesto flavor (the main flavor). Octopus cassoulet ($16)- 3.5/5 Portion was super tiny compared to the Yelp pictures. Everything was yummy and I asked for chorizo on the side but apparently it's better with it. It's basically beans and octopus with tomato broth. As you walk up, you'll find yourself walking through a gift shop. Once you go in, there's a door at the end that leads to where the real party starts. When you walk into the restaurant, you'll be immediately greeted with lively music. The ambiance? Low-lit and upscale. Perfect place to come on a date or for a night out with friends.As for the food, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I decided to go with the Crispy Eggplant Pizzetta for appetizer. It was good, tasted like your typical flatbread. Now for my entree, I got the Beauty &amp; Essex Burger which was amazing! The combination of: lamb, short rib, and brisket made it taste very unique. Smooth texture and rich flavor. If you come for a birthday or anniversary they will treat you to either a complementary champagne or complementary dessert, so keep that in mind! I received great service from my waiter and had a great time here. Highly satisfied with my visit! I have only been here for brunch but it is my go-to place to bring out of towners to impress. The whole ""enter through the pawn shop"" thing is a little kitschy because it's clearly not a secret, but the ambience inside is awesome.The first several times I visited, we did the a la carte brunch, where you're seating in the main dining area. The menu is small plates, which can get a little pricey and if you add drinks (cocktails are $17), it's definitely a bit of a splurge, but so good.Recently, I made reservations for 1pm on a Sunday and they accidentally assumed I meant Champagne Brunch. Best mistake ever! I will only attend Champagne Brunch from here on out. Everyone is seated at the same time, upstairs. The room is more intimate than the main dining room and dark. There's music and towards the end they come around and hand out glow sticks. It's tons of fun. But the best part is the food! I assumed the menu was a ""pick one from each category"" sort of affair, but no, you get everything on the menu, plus champagne! I think it cost around $60/person which is less than our normal brunch spend and we got way more food. The only thing that concerned me a little was the table next to us had 3 people and they received the exact same portions as our party of 2, even for items like the grilled cheese soup dumplings (you get 4) which aren't ""shareable."" Since you're paying per person, I would expect the portions to be divided evenly. Mostly, I made a note to myself to only come in even groups.Some menu highlights: Red Velvet Waffles, Kale &amp; Apple Salad, Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon &amp; Tomato Soup Dumplings, Fried Chicken Biscuit Bites I have always had this place in mind since like 2009, no lie, from my coworkers and it's been sitting in my Yelp's bookmark since that year LOL. But I've finally given this place a try and took my friends under my wings for my great suggestions and boy were we not wrong! Amazing dcor, delicious food with beautiful presentation. I honestly can't decide if their brunch or dinner is better - you can't lose either way. It definitely is on the boujee-er side of things for those who hate that type of dynamic - but for those who want to indulge it's one hell of an experience (even my mom loved it!). Whatever you do, don't skip out on the grilled cheese tomato soup bacon dumplings. I'm also partial to the Beauty Elixer cocktail - it's the perfect balance of refreshing and fruity, without being too sweet. Going just to see the champagne lounge in the women's bathroom is worth it! Everything you eat here is finger licking good. I want to go back everyday!! My favorite was the crab Rangoon, lobster Mac and tuna tacos! Omg it was mouth watering. The ambiance is really hip. When you walk in, it appears as if you are in a music store but then there's a secret door that opens up to a palace like Restaurant and lounge. They serve champagne in the bathrooom!!! For free! And the last thing that made this an all around amazing dining experience was the dessert. I had cake balls on a stick. This was best cake I have ever eaten. I will dream about this cake for many years to come.",https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/T0KCvQyqHSClgUQhO02slQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/P93qd3KkHip_rKOX8Jflmw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QvEEG3s5v5RnK7jUfhKOLA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TxNOpPs9Rb9L_bLo6LQF3w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Tc2afU4_1OyNcheoX9fcug/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RtOkQ5A4M739E_wQ5eEsjA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5033QFgLl8x-e3EBvJLx3g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LX3IU-KCkKdeC699oSjDDw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8auHv9PhpGxRthM4Zb3liw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2GHlvknB9HNl_97M9XcH9w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/X_uhk_XkAPkxf1qeMdFWcA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CpxTJm4UeQNHskfoELU8Ew/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Ly3vwIUFGKTsLP7sZStBkw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZzbwPLI2NyfriRFPMf_r7A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RJ11ILSWeSITX5NkDAPqaA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XrmuQ1AuxqPEkYisUw48Ug/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7kLBk38SRXvbJ7dJwEhtTA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GMuokcVK30YNgoAHgBVzrg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mp4uYXspkI-Qxobb8wiuWA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dPsxIKvoBbg3PubuyVd_Hg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/C6N1OeF6F0B7JPQJ3aa9dA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/k4v0t6HBXj-a0CC6TyO_Qg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IxHG7hWIs-1i5p67X5uZFA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/a7zny6BhkrUzMLnWFbV8Ew/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zuPq3lYdpilFhnQNykschQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lxukqqL6p-eC39ZfZEBrJg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YBLHH8GS8Ms-J3Y63fjECg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/27lez2AnnpYJ-f2_it3ZNA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/v7i9afmbZXfHNmJeiy9sBA/258s.jpg,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/bensons-nyc-new-york,bensons-nyc-new-york,New York,10002,NY,American (New),Breakfast & Brunch,Burgers,"What a nice experience this was. The owners had a vision for a small neighborhood pub with good food and they hit the mark. Great beer selection and advice if you are not familiar with the variety of tap beers. I went here because of the Yelp reviews on my favorite food, the burger, but I'll get to that in a minute. I get to NYC alot and will try to go back here but if I lived anywhere close, this would be my go to place. These are nice folks!Now the burger. Meat well cooked, made from short rib and crazy good. Their house made bacon almost stole the show. The bun was huge and I hate big bun burgers but...it was very airy, collapsed nicely and held together as well as any bun I have seen and tasted great so don't let it freak you out. Overall, exceptional ingredients and a very good result. Heads up East Village and Lower Eastside, I would feel blessed to have this pub and burger in my neighborhood so show them some love!Almost forgot the fries, hand cut and scrumptious, no frozen crap here. Enjoy!!! Pro's:  The burgers at this place are honestly some of the best I've ever had.  My friend and I split the BBQ and Peppercorn burgers and they were both incredible.  The Peppercorn was the winner, but you can't go wrong with either and they have a solid number of other burgers to choose from.  The beer menu was great and nicely organized.Con's:  I was really disappointed that they advertise a bunch of great beers on their website but when I got they said they didn't have all three of the one's I would want to try.  To be fair, they note that they rotate beers regularly so the menu online might change, but I think they should make a better attempt to keep it updated.  Also, the service is insanely slow, but it's a small place and I don't think they have many employees.Overall, definitely a cool place and will be back to try other burgers. Sometimes it seems like such a production to just go to a good dinner in New York, but everything about Benson's screams 'easy' - in a good way. We were able to slide right in on a Friday night, order up some beers, ciders, and burgers, and have a low-key but tasty meal in a lively but not overcrowded spot.  The menu is simple but robust. There are lots of beers to choose from, and I appreciated their extensive cider selection, too. There are some non burger options on the menu for sure, but everyone in our party went with the Original burger, which comes with your choice of side. This allowed us to try out the fries, onion rings, and asparagus between our party of three without having to buy three full sides/apps to share. The onion rings were extremely heavily battered (could barely spot the onion under all that fried goodness), but overall everything was really tasty. The burgers were cooked right to our specifications and were hearty without being a gut bomb. The server was very friendly and fun, and though she did keep us waiting a while a couple of times, she acknowledged and apologized for it so all was good. The atmosphere, like the menu, is casual and - yes, that's right - easy. It's a small place with small tables but plenty of elbow room and not too loud to carry on a real conversation. A great place to have a burger and a beer (or cider) with friends! Every day it seems is a holiday. From ""Kiss your mom day"" to ""National Apple Pie Day"", every day is now turned into a fun day. I'm submitting ""Give all your dollars to Bill S"" day. Somehow stars aligned when I was on the Lower East Side for ""National Cheeseburger Day"". On meatless Monday no less?! Since its an official holiday, let me roll towards one of my Yelp bookmarks, Benson's NYC.Benson's NYC is a typical, smaller pub on the Lower East Side. If 30 people showed up, the place would be jammed. Lots of 4 &amp; 5 star reviews from some of my Yelp friends. Bill T said the burgers looked like something you'd see on a food show?? Oh baby, let me belly up to the bar and get my burger on.I ordered ""The Classic Burger"" topped with grilled onion, cheddar, lettuce, tomato &amp; house sauce. Look at the picture, perfecto! These guys are true burger lovers, from the bun to the short rib burger blend, my burger was top notch. The fries were also a hit, I am a total Benson's NYC fan for life. Now add 40+ available craft beers, Benson's NYC is a great place to kick back with your buddies for a burger &amp; a beer.Now where the heck do I go for National Take Your Parents to Lunch Day?? I'm feelin' Benson's NYC, mom would want Le Cirque... A few friends and I stopped by here on a Sunday afternoon for brunch after looking for places to eat in the area. As an appetizer, we settled for the garlic and cheese flatbread which turned out to be delicious. It was warm and cheesy and somewhat reminiscent of pizza. I'd definitely recommend the flat bread as a starter. I shared an order of onion rings with a friend and we both agreed that it was extremely greasy. There was even grease dripping through the wax paper. Also it was a bit batter heavy. For the entree, I settled for the lamb burger with a side of salad. All burgers come with the option of either fries or a salad, with the option of sweet potato fries for $1 extra. I had a hard time choosing between the lamb and benson burgers, but eventually went with lamb after reading some good reviews for it here on Yelp. My burger was juicy and delicious. One of the better burgers I've had in the Lower East Side. The bun they used had an interesting taste and texture (not sure what kind of bun it was.) Overall, I'd definitely recommend coming to Benson's for brunch. The food was amazing and the service here was impeccable. Delicious.  Decent atmosphere.  Burger and fries were delicious.  Good service.  Not much seating. Little Aussie Burger spot. Bartenders are super friendly. The salad was huge and delicious! They have a super cool beer list and I ended up trying a pineapple cider. I was skeptical at first but then loved it! Small space but definitely worth it! Benson's  in my opinion the best burger place in NYC!! I came here with my friend who wanted to try their veggie burger and I opted for the lamb burger with onion rings. And that's all the fat lady sang. The owners are so nice. Whenever I come in they make me feel so welcomed. I'm pretty sure they encounter hundreds of people week, but they always make me feel like I'm an old friend. I hear lamb burger calling my name. Oh and the have bacon on the menu...yes bacon. Any place that has bacon on the menu is A-OK my book My friends and I stumbled upon this place on a Sunday evening looking for dinner. After wandering around and refusing to wait an eternity, we decided to give Benson's a try because there was no wait. The place was actually empty when we walked in. Our hostess was a total sweetheart so we decided to take a leap of faith and stayed here for dinner. Most of my friends ordered burgers and they all loved it. I ordered the sausage and sun dried tomato flat bread, which came out more like a thin crust pizza than a flatbread. They sure did not skimp out on the cheese though. There was so much cheese on my flatbread that I had to eat it with a fork. Literally the cheesiest flatbread I've ever had. Overall, I enjoyed my experience at Benson's. It's a super relaxed place to grab food/drinks and catch up with friends. They also have a decent selection of beer too. Good vibes, but I was pretty disappointed the wedges didn't come with sour cream and sweet chili sauce. Very un Australian. Small and cozy spot that's great for a burger or brunch. Annie, the owner of Benson's, is down to earth and very helpful with our questions about the food and drinks. For $28 at brunch, you can get any entree and 3 drinks. Note that they don't serve hard liquor, and the Bloody Sake Mary is now off the menu due to lack of demand.The atmosphere and food were great. I regret not getting one of their signature burgers because my friends raved about them during and post-consumption. Although my avocado toast with eggs was flavorful and tasty, it didn't blow me away. I definitely look forward to coming back to give their burgers a try. I LOVE Benson's! There's nothing bad I can say about this place at all.  The food is always delicious.  I try to order something different each time, but most of the time i order my usual--the Bacon, pineapple and cheddar pizza.  Today i had the frittata of the day for brunch, which also did not disappoint (The fries were SOOO good too!). They also keep a great mix of beers on tap and in bottles &amp; cans.Annie, Dave and the rest of the staff at Benson's are awesome.  They always make me feel welcome--whether i'm with a group of friends or dropping by for a solo visit.  If you're down in this part of town definitely stop by for some drinks and food--you won't regret it. Decent selection of beer! I had a burger and my friend had a salad. Both were good. the service was also decent. i would def come back again =) Small but cosy bar/restaurant on the LES. Doesn't get quite as busy as some of the other spots in this area, but serves decent draft beer (small selection) and some nice salads and flatbreads. Peppercorn burger is delicious  highly recommend it Great ambiance and vibe - Annie was super awesome and welcoming  Will definitely be returning Last night for dinner I ventured out for a burger at Bensons, having heard only good things before. I wasn't disappointed, and I'm sure because I live nearby I'll be going again. My boyfriend got a peppercorn burger and fries. I think he liked the burger enough! No complaints. The fries apparently weren't too good, though. He said they were too salty. Personally, I thought they just weren't cooked evenly. Some bites were way overcooked because they were saturated in grease, thicker bites were just a bit too underdone. I'm gluten-free, so I got a classic burger without the bun, and I opted for the salad. The side salad may have actually been the best part of the meal, not that the burger was bad or anything - the salad was just well dressed and fresh. My burger was good, juicy, and cooked exactly how I requested. However, it was kinda JUST a burger. Nothing too special, but no complaints whatsoever. The beer selection was also great! They had local rotations and a wide selection of ciders. I suggest dropping by! To ring in the new year 2017 is to color the table with good food and wine.Peppercorn burger $16.00 - ranch dressing, American cheese, pickles served on a very chewy ciabatta roll.  I opt for salad as my choice for a substitute of the standard hand cut fries.  Ground beef is well prepared juicy and the ranch dressing added flavor.  The cheese was very minimal and there were no red onions.  I actually enjoyed my burger which enabled me to eat my fill.  The server Will was probably intoxicated or the brain does not function as I specifically requested salad when placing my food and drink order but served me a paper cone and stanchion for the fries.Shiraz $9.00 - Good body and good food pairing with meat (steak and beef).  However, the server gave me Pinot Noir (white) $10.00 which he quickly corrected but later charged me Pinot Noir.  The Pinot Noir is $1.00 more than the Shiraz.  Pinot Noir's food pairings are: grilled salmon, chicken, lamb and Japanese dishes (notably sushi rolls).Selection for beer is relatively good for a burger bar.  The stacked menu is served on a clipboard one cut smaller than the first as tabs.  There are hooks available under the bar counter for jackets and bags to be placed as patrons are sitting on old school bar stools (no backing).  One microscopic tiny restroom facility is located on site which barely provides space to stretch.  Free match boxes and business cards are readily available.  Service is turtle slow from greeting, taking my order, serving my drink request, correcting the server's gross error for the incorrect drink, serving my burger and ultimately correcting the side dish of my requested salad.  The service is very mediocre, inattentive lacking accuracy, effort and care.  The bar tender/server changed shifts during my stay whom the first dude was melancholy, surly, and lack enthusiasm for the job. Brunch fare was sooo tasty, I had the brekky sandwich and it was divine. The staff was the friendliest I've ever met in NYC, they really take good care of you. I'll definitely visit again when I'm in the area. Bensons is pretty much the bomb.I had not been here since the killer yelp event a few years back (what up six point?), and man do I regret the lost moments I could have been spending cozied up here. OK Cozied up may be the wrong expression, but I do lament not sitting at this bar more often, knocking back a few choice brews with the amazingness that is a Benson burger. Ugh that burger. If you've never had the pleasure, and at ALL like a prime cut of beef ground and grilled into perfection then make your way over here. Seriously go. now. why are you still here...OK ok back to the review. The space itself is nicely put together, especially those enormous front windows (the light pours in), but lets be honest, I'm not looking for luxury lighting when i'm down here, I am looking for beer....lots and lots of beer, and man do these guys deliver (Aussie aussie aussie, oy oy oy). The list here really is expertly put together, and you absolutely can, and should find a few australian beers (place is an Aussie bar if you didn't know). Come for the burger (seriously), stay for the beer, and make sure to say hey to the exceptionally nice folks running the place that will lull you into a drunken coma with both their charming accents, and their strong brews. This place is doing everything ""right."" It's got the wood tables and local art show and the craft beer list and burgers, but it's just not very good at it. It's lacking heart and soul and the caring that results in noticing the details of how things are working. Here are a couple things: have a lager on tap. I know IPA are the rage but I'll bet that 90% of people like lagers, including me. Next, if you ask a customer's name, ask because you care what it is, not because you're trying to open a tab because that's what it says in the training manual. Third, if you're training a new bartender it's best not to train them pouring their first beer ever right in front of you and having them spill the whole thing because it's all head. It just doesn't look professional. I'm paying for a basic level of experience here. Lastly, the burger was hands down the saltiest I've ever had. I was starving so I ate it, but it was a travesty. The potato wedges were great. Somebody other than the chef needs to taste for seasoning standards.Overall, this place seems to have local support, but in broader terms it needs to step up its game to get above average marks.",https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IRDAMx_lRnwe36Uh0n8ZnA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MwrXOCQg8_oOFHUTyVJ1hA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IqwvRoVNmIiUHTlCWDtzXg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tY5LuBBAKy5ZJ02TYTa5ow/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nGpfrAGCTctb9lpw1itdnA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LWfMR7_0qSzDDDdq7UOXrQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qoV4Uc_BL8I98DRcMDFxEA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pzFMotnaZT9o6jTEDNrfpA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ffxbSwac0-vnzDyaBI2CNQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZaMbCISu7pApVOMEKcMudA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VRE-aFa1MYD4kTzuw0xzVA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MwCNUlTvHfcYH9bLcKGn-w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qlKy7J3eAv1a12Bj68jM2g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gax4MGQ3CxlsMqtDVF01uw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/K6sYaluMB1SUnUQW-3dHiA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7Nm4BXsR10TxqcdXoBJCwQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nO8fv5wK95xM15f1Rkptvg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/q3MLroBzveotPUGbCRxADQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mHb1rwGy4WJShCiYepxu5g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Kd2t8GwEu007s_S2bUGYjQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OHuEcr0_EuVS9Hw314whmg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bmiarhqbBC9z7UvG1uKGvg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xDXXdaPSOKijdz1H1k7WbQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2KzQNsXj_Hq7rPdMAIqNkw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jhNvlsUXMsAjXhWot_-axA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pJFVY3zQOytWzer1pawcYw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Ex65lJsXFAKuFtB8mbjtJw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oKG0k8Mt0OYwF923SghHPg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/n7bw0-KRi6CH26TfywT7Ow/258s.jpg,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/bep-ga-new-york-4,bep-ga-new-york-4,New York,10002,NY,Vietnamese,Chicken Shop,Cafes,"Okay so this place is a hole in the wall but packs big flavors.Everything taste fresh and it specializes in chicken!! I got the chicken noodle salad and the chicken rice dish. I heard there's only a certain # of dishes for the day or something along those lines so that's why it closes so early. The soup that comes with the dish was a very warming broth and wasn't too salty but just right.The noodle dish had a bunch of fresh veggies and herbs which I really liked with the hot soup and noodles.The rice dish had a really flavorful yellow rice and the ginger sauce was delicious.The chicken in both dishes were succulent and not dry at all; which I hate when it comes to chicken dishes.Nothing to complain about this place but again it is really small!! The chicken rice was good, I also tried the pho ga before writing this review. I really wanted to like the pho but unfortunately it wasn't great. Tasted like noodles in water with dry chicken and sprigs of herbs.So go for the rice, I'm going to assume the salad entree will also be good. But skip the pho. This compares with a lot of the past chicken pho I've had in SoCal and Vietnam. Compared to some of the other pho restaurants in Chinatown, this place makes real chicken pho as a main item and not some afterthought.The restaurant itself is pretty cozy and sparsely decorated. There's only a few things on the menu: rice, pho, salad, and a few other items.The pho is very reasonable for what they charge here. Definitely stop by if you haven't been here. If you don't try you'll never know.... so glad I finally tried this place. I want to try the pho but I always crave for the chicken and rice dish. It's so good and I always feel warm and fuzzy inside. I could almost eat this every week. Highly recommend this place. The food comes out super fast. The chicken is tender and the rice is just yummmmmmmmm... no words to describe the food. Just go try it! If pho ga could have a millennial vibe, this is it. It's not your traditional pho ga, but it's still helllla good. 10/10 for food, service and vibes. I highly recommend this place!!!Small seating area, but I bet takeout is just as good. :) Bep Ga is one of my top choices when it comes to chicken pho. The shop is a hole in the wall place hidden in deep Chinatown. Thanks to my Vietnamese friend who is always looking for food pho, I found this gem.Although the menu has limited items -- basically chicken over rice and chicken pho (Bep Ga means chicken in Vietnamese), both of them are very healthy and flavorful yet light, which is perfect for summer. If you want additional kick, ask for their special lemon based hot sauce. $10 per bowl is very fair price given quality and quantity. Will come back soon! Review from a Vietnamese born and raised in Vietnam:Mediocre chicken pho: broth was pretty much flavorless, needed to add salt or fish sauce (I don't eat salty food), good amount of dried noodles, 1 quail egg - not 2 like other Yelp pictures show, got 2 tiny tiny pieces of lime for 2 bowls of pho, white meat only (why?).Chicken rice: again, white meat only (why???), rice was moist and taste ok. Presentation was well. On bottom of the tiny soup cup that came with the rice dish was chicken flavor powder that you can find in instant ramen flavor packs - nowhere in Vietnam does that. Vnese iced coffee: standard you can find everywhere. Please change your tiny flimsy plastic spoons, it was hard to eat especially with hot soup.For $10 per dish you will be close to full. Service was good. Plastic chairs are nice touch and give the place more Vietnamese feel but that won't do the trick if the pho is messed up. Or maybe my expectations were too high since there is ""g"" in the name but the g wasn't good. Came back after a few months since they first opened during the summer time. Since then, they've decorated the space and installed an air conditioner. I love this place, it's a small sit down/ stand up place to grab a quick bite. They have around 3-4 selection, I'm a big fan of the Pho, salad and the chicken and rice dish. The a lot of the dishes are based around a Vietnamese chicken stock which is clean, light and nuanced. they provide a mixture of dark and white meat, quail egg and vegetables. Depending on the pho place, some has had a heavier, meatier, broth, but this place is quiet enjoyable, and there's complexity and depth to it. If you're looking for a quick neighborhood place with unique food I would check this place out. Service is friendly, its clean, no bathrooms, ambiance is hole in the wall with low plastic chairs and standing room. The main focus I think is their broth, I got take out as well, but it definitely wasn't as good as eating on the spot as the noodles tend to get soggy, even though the broth is separated. Came here for their chicken pho. It is pricey for what you get especially since it is chicken pho. But the pho is quite good. Their vietnamese coffee is strong but could be better with more condensed milk. My Vietnamese friend is always looking for good chicken pho. When I found out Bep Ga specializes in chicken pho, we definitely had to try this place out. Apparently Bep Ga means Chicken Kitchen in Vietnamese. Now I understand why their entire menu has chicken in it. The restaurant is very small. I think it can only seat about 8-10 people. There's also one person taking orders and making the food one order at a time, so you do have to be patient. Every dish is $10 which I think is the right price for the portion of food we got. We each ordered a bowl of chicken pho and also ordered a plate of the chicken rice to share.This was my first time eating chicken pho. The broth is much lighter than the beef broth, but still flavorful in its own way. I could taste a lot more white pepper in the broth. The chicken was very tender and they give you a lot of chicken. Each bowl even comes with a quail egg. I was pretty stuffed after that bowl.I liked the chicken rice just as much as the chicken pho. The dish had very simple and clean flavors. The chicken was the same as the one they use in the pho. I thought the rice would have a strong flavor from the turmeric, but it was actually very light. For me personally, I would have preferred if the flavor was stronger, but I really enjoyed the moist texture of the rice. You get most of the flavor from the fish sauce, though my Vietnamese friend said he actually never seen this dish served with fish sauce before. If you want an additional kick, use the bottle of lime chili salt they have on each table. It has a really strong sour, salty, and spicy flavor. Your taste buds will tingle when you first try it. Might take some getting used to, but I really liked it.Too bad this place isn't around where I worked so I could come here for lunch. Only thing I wish is that they used regular bowls instead of disposable plastic bowls for the pho. Seems kind of wasteful to dispose all that plastic. They already use regular plates for the chicken rice, but maybe bowls are harder to manage. Came here because I am always in sure of good chicken pho similar to I believe northern Vietnam. Where they use bigger noodles and is with a lemon instead of a lime. It taste like the Cantonese boiled chicken but in soup form. Anyways, they didn't serve that here but the chicken pho here is very flavorful with lemongrass. Boo Boo and I each got an order of the pho and the salad. The only protein hey serve is chicken. He menu is limited to soup, rice, salad. We shared the ice coffee. We had to buy a bottle water to thin out the coffee. It was rich with coffee ;) it might have needed more milk but it was very good. There's very limited seating. You're best bet if you have more than 2 people is to eat it to-go outside by the park. Also, if you need a restroom. Go to the park. If you want to cigarette, walk right outside there will be few Chinese old men that will be smoking. The food is very good and affordable. I would go out of my way to get a meal from here. Spicy village a couple stores next door is also worth a shot. Like the lamb burger type thing from SV and the pho from here would be an amazing meal. I've eaten pho all over Vietnam - Hanoi, Hoi An, Saigon...this was excellent! Glad to see this street opening new stuff, used to be a random store back when I went to school around the corner.Menu is simple, rice, noodles, or a salad; chicken rice, chicken pho with noodles, or chicken salad. Every dish is about $10 each.After passing by this pink store front a couple of times, I finally stepped inside and ordered chicken rice.Although it took 15 minutes to complete my order, as I was warned in the beginning before giving my payment, it was worth the wait.The chicken rice was dressed so nicely with basil, onions, cucumbers, and tomatoes.  It came with a sweet salty viet fish sauce to be mixed in with the dish and chicken broth on the side.  Rice was so moist and tasty.  The chicken was not too dry and it was smooth.  This is probably the best Viet chicken rice I've had in the city.Seating is limited, only two tables and some stools on the side.  I like the cheap plastic chair look, reminds me of Vietnam.  Seems like the signage outside is still being constructed and this place is still pretty new.  I can see this place being more popular when word spreads, but before it does, I'm glad I was able to try the rice.  Next stop, the chicken pho! Came in on a Monday around 1230ish for lunch and found ample seating. It's a small little spot with only a handful of items on the menu. It's chicken based so everything chicken here!. I ordered the following:Chicken rice - it came out looking very presentable but honestly, I've had better chicken rice. The chicken served here comes de-boned, which is a plus! But it was also not as juicy and some pieces were really dry. The rice and condiments it came with was mediocre. A small cup of the pho broth came with the meal as well which was good. Iced viet coffee - normal. Nothing out of the world. Always refreshing to have one. Total $ = around $14. Since it's the early stages for the establishment, I'll give them another shot later down the line but for now, I'll go elsewhere for my fix. No air conditioning in the summer for the small space. We sat outside. Well prepared and fresh ingredients with flavorful and interesting twist to the traditional Vietnamese staples. We had the chicken noodle salad which was my fav because it's saucy and tangy without being bland with the simple ingredients chicken, bean sprout, cilantro and noodles.The rice dish also had great flavor, particularly how they infused the yellow spices into the rice. It could use more veggie though.We got the chicken salad because there was a mix up with the order. I personally am not a huge fan of the cabbage and bean sprout combo. A crisp appetizer for a hot summer day though.Pricey for the area but worth it if you're looking for more fusion/""new"" Vietnamese vibe. 3.5 stars, rounding up for value and service. I got the chicken rice. They separate out the components, and for a first timer it was a little confusing how you were supposed to mix and match them. I wound up pouring the broth on the rice, only to later learn the ginger sauce is supposed to go on the rice. Each piece had great flavor (crispy shallots! Ginger sauce! Flavorful rice!), I just wish I'd gotten a better primer. Folks near me also seemed to be loving the ramen, which seems a little more first-timer friendly. Note that seating is a little limited - maybe 10 seats across two communal tables, so you may wind up having to stand or make some new friends if you dine in. If you're looking for unadulterated Vietnamese food, this place is worth a visit. They recently opened and have a basic menu focusing on chicken dishes. Shop owner is also very sweet.Space - Cute space with a splash of pink on the walls. There's one small table that can seat up to four, and another long table that can seat up to eight.Chicken Rice - Picante. I don't handle spicy all too well, and this definitely falls on the spicy side when you run into a chili pepper or two. Nonetheless, still cleaned the plate. Fall apart, tender chicken. Spectacular. I came here at 2pm on a Saturday for lunch and did NOT have to wait. I was able to grab a seat at one of the two only tables in the restaurant.  There's four or five main entrees to choose from and ordered the chicken salad (comes with accompanying chicken broth).  Service was fast- they call your name when your dish is ready to be picked up from the counter.  It was good- quite refreshing on a hot summer day.  Chicken broth took it to another level.  All ingredients were fresh! Be warned- the ginger gives it a spicy kick but I would consider it 'mild' spiciness!  Pros: no wait, simple/flavorful/fresh foodCons: self-serve (they call your name when food is ready), only two tables FYI: the signage for the restaurant does not display well-- it's the shop with a white rectangle banner without words near the park in Chinatown! I absolutely adore this restaurant! As a Vietnamese growing up eating pho for breakfast and chicken over rice for lunch, I know what they should taste like, and this place delivers. The Hoi An chicken is definitely my favorite. The sauce, the rice, and the CHICKEN, were so perfect. Highly recommended! Loved the Hoi An Chicken dish. There were so many flavors and textures woven together from the turmeric seasoned rice to the pickled onion and crispy garlic (well I think it was garlic) and the cup of broth on the side. The chicken was also so tender, and the whole dish felt very home style. So good, I'll definitely have to go back and try some of the other dishes!",https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nsOcPGCTTpVX98i_C1JbNQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7TmrDn_OZF_JYeFSM8Pbqg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rNjw5Vr_vZX41nXZeNKv6A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AD8DAQ-RueX1E1kf-tEcSQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8NFZfaluPfnXY1BI01b4_g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Wkve0UtL1Yhb-brr8h3yUg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pVym1sZ5aMMtktVgRds8vQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hjqB3oZ2Di793dEx58hiOQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/L6_8rZXvZA6mY3Eo-bj0UA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Jz_9tyWUUvFpd-ef20iWyA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-OLeCAFVMVlokKyTJRdFEw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HgT5i3nmgHhPSFM1p3Ysbw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NqemKMo1Qbfox2vydzgtSQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qDa5goINVBOaKDjC-4Mp9A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/18-0yf8ul42TT3QKPykzrQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/d6V6m1rVB6gjfUVAJCDYMQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wEZBlJ42SHg4pHEn7HYSUw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/D8FOUz6QcELJlMTILXu26g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/w0FGtZbU_oN7sD2_KHKi_g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/z5k9R08rUyIdqYXUhH-ILg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NoayWK7R0h3Fcx8dwScRAQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MzO3BrY0IzdtiNXR5qi7Sw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8Cm07VvMlEhJDK_QdFXP_w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uOYmuZJq-I6wH73bUVBOBQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WNTOLPLDjaK1ItYP4SP4sg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hawPg18Euu5HXOrPJf-A6w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/H9tqngGSVpqt5XpM6YsQgw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JIjNk1S916QAb7wu6q7JIA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/E1DO9N4N13UJr483prv_ew/258s.jpg,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/big-wong-new-york,big-wong-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Chinese,Seafood,NA,"I'm a fan. It's one of these ""fast casual"" places in Chinatown where you can sit down and have a quick meal of solid Cantonese food. Really good duck too. People are consistently standing around buying ducks - both locals of the neighborhood and people you can tell don't live around the area. The duck is always crispy and fresh and the other dishes: noodles, congees, over rice never disappoint. Really affordable too. The food here is mediocre at best, compared to what you come in for and going to another restaurant to order it. Their meats are served cold and their prices are no longer a bang for your buck. My dad and I used to come here to support our local Chinese restaurants but they do not deserve to be in business. When I was a child and maybe it was because I was so young that I thought their food and service was acceptable. The last time I came here was for dinner with a friend. We are both Chinese and we asked to sit in the back. The restaurant was not full and there was plenty of room. The male waiter literally started CURSING at us that we asked to sit in the back. The entire staff was staring at us but no one said anything to defend us. If you haven't noticed, they like to save the back which has a slightly better seating for non-Asians. I do not expect good customer service in Chinatown but I have never had a server yell and literally curse at me. I believe that as consumers we have the choice to support businesses that we believe in. There are so many other Chinese restaurants in the area that are worth trying. One of the best San Bao fan in Manhattan! 4 stars because they give you 2 meats and an egg instead of 3 meats, like in the outer boroughs.FoodYou really only get one thing here, and that's the meat on rice. As I mentioned earlier, their standard San Bao fan is 2 meats and an egg, which is standard for a bunch of other places in Chinatown I've visited. So, I asked for 3 meats this time, and they added 3.25 to the dish price. Definitely worth it! I've ordered some other dishes while they're not bad, they're just not the best things here.DecorIt's a cheap Chinese restaurant, what do you expect? It's authentic and reminiscent of an older time for Chinatown.ServiceThe wait staff are rather polite and very quick. I think a few of them have been with the restaurant for a decade!NoteThe bathroom is nasty. It's likely one of their cost cutting measures. I know this place is popular for its meat products but I am not a fan of their char siu. I prefer a sweet and salty taste while their char siu was pretty bland, although well cooked. So I would not recommend this place to people who like their roast pork sweet.I also dined in once. Nothing impressed me. Beef ho fun was just so-so. Roast duck and beef eggplants were okay. Price is quite affordable as it locates in Chinatown. Wonton noodle is definitely one of the top comfort food and Big Wong done it right. I read a lot of comments saying how dirty the restaurant is but it looks totally fine to me, at least compared to Ctown standard haha. My friends and I both got Duck Wonton Noodles and a dish of Broiled Yu Choi. The noodles is soo hearty with a lot of wontons. Deep fried duck is not too oily. Yu Choi is broiled to the perfect level when it's still a bit crunchy, then deep in hoisin sauce, which is surprisingly good trust me. Needless to say, you can't beat the price at Asian restaurants. Of course, don't expect any service. Just get your belly filled. Big Wong is an authentic restaurant to Chinatown frequented by many Chinese locals. They serve typical Cantonese casual food -- BBQ meats, congees, noodle soups, and stir fry dishes. The service is quick and no-frills, but the food is very affordable.The roast pork here is very good, and so are their congees. Make sure to order fried dough along with the congee! These guys serve up Some really delicious Chinese food.  Everything comes out hot and quick.  They have some creative sauces they make themselves (ask for their ginger sauce).  Their prices are fair. My only complaint is there bathroom facilities.  I've been here several times and cannot fathom why they cannot redo their bathrooms and keep them clean - so that they don't smell light urine.  Employees should be required to wash their hands after using the bathroom - i was a witness to an unacceptable practice.  It's a shame that i have to give them 3 stars based on their bathrooms - they're disgusting. TLDR: authentic, cheap, delicious Cantonese food; great for takeout; would recommend the wonton mein and cha siu fan (roast pork with rice)I've been eating at Big Wong since I was a kid and still consider it to be my go-to whenever I'm craving authentic Cantonese food. While the giant ""grade pending"" sign on the door and huge slabs of roast pork hanging in the window may turn you off, rest-assured, it's always the no frills, underrated looking places that have the best Chinese food.While there are tables to dine in, I always head to the front register to order takeout. My favorite dishes are wonton mein (mein = thin yellow noodles, fun = wider, flat rice noodles) with cha siu (roast pork) and choy sum (Chinese broccoli) and cha siu fan with choy sum (roast pork with Chinese broccoli and white rice). The portions are generous, prices are reasonable (around $8), and the food always tastes so good.Service is usually very quick and this place is cash only. I usually order in Cantonese (the limited words I know almost all center around food), but the staff also knows English. Most of the patrons are locals living around Chinatown and speaking Cantonese, which is always a good indication of the authenticity of the food. The food here is so bomb. I've been coming here since I was a little kid. I have the fondest memories of the food here and I went today and the quality is still the same. Delicious. Fragrant. Savory.Their salted pork and egg congee is absolutely amazing and to die for. It brings me to a place of happiness not many kinds of food can. For those unfamiliar with the taste of thousand year old egg, its unique and not as disgusting sounding as it seems. Their BBQ ribs is so delicious. When I was in college, my mom would send me off with boxes of these ribs before I went to school. These are probably some of the best ribs in chinatown. And that is saying a lot because chinatown has quality ribs everywhere. Their ribs are probably more pricey than ones at other restaurants but I think it is worth it. Their sauce and flavoring is on point. Horrible cash only establishment with very poor service that demands an automatic tip. They are super irritableWhen u do not understand their accent (I have one so I'm super patient). They super rush you through everything. Food is absolutely NOTHING to write home about. Meal for 4 and 2 sodas was $104 including the $14 automatic Tip. I usually tip 20% but upset that horrible service demands an automatic too from me. Do not go here. Super disappointed by the great reviews. Not sure how I missed the huge ""EAT AT UR OWN RISK"" sign at the door from the NY department of health. The place is nasty!! Do not attempt to walk into the unlit bathrooms or peep into the kitchen and see the filthy floors. U have been warned. Not sure which establishment the other helpers who loved it went to.. Found this tiny Cantonese restaurant in Chinatown, and had lunch here with my friend. Their menu included a wide variety of traditional Cantonese foods. The beef fried with rice noodles was one of their specialties, and it was really good. The chicken was fried with pineapple, with a special taste of sweet and sour. The assorted veggies included lots of fresh green leaves. I have to say I don't LOVE eating at this place but they have great take out. I always go for Beef Chow Fun, lately it has less sauce on it and less beef which makes me sad but you still get a lot of noodles and food for a pretty reasonable price. I would give zero star but since I have to give so one star it is. Been coming to this establishment since 70's but today will be my last! I came here with my family and ordered roast duck over rice and 3 other noodle dish.  Roast duck over rice: 2 pieces of fat and 4 pieces of small ... literally just bones.  Fried crispy noodles with meat:  the noodles were soggy and the bean sprouts had rotten taste.  Another noodle: don't know the name in English...but will post pictures- the noodle were under cook and tasteless.  The waiter that served us was rude and the place were filthy.  There are a lot of choices and better places to eat in Chinatown.  I will not return nor recommend this place! Come here if you're looking for cheap comfort Cantonese food. Big Wong specializes in their congees (Chinese rice porridge) and is often packed with locals and tourists. This is my number 1 go-to place whenever I'm in Chinatown and looking for a good old bowl of congee. Coupled with an order of sweet deep fried dough, this dish is perfection. Big Wong offers many types of congees, but my personal favorite is the thousand year old egg congee. Their congees were the first meals I bought when I got my wisdom teeth extracted on 2 separate occasions. Not only do they offer congee, they also serve cheap and filling dinners/lunches as well. Also offered here are cha siu (roast pork) and roasted duck. They're also to die for. Big Wong also has a special going on for some time now (not sure if it's still going on or not) for 2 lobsters with ginger and scallion for only $20! Overall, definitely check out this place for inexpensive and filling Cantonese food. I'll be back in the future. I ain't gonna lie.  I've never eaten here, but certainly would've had we more time.  I have absolutely no ownership, interest, or relationship with this establishment.  I simply gotta give a restaurant named after me some major props! Before we arrived NY, my wife kept telling me if there is only one restaurant we are going to dine in, it has to be Big Wong.  Obviously, my wife knows exactly what I love.  I am a very simple guy so naturally I enjoy simple everyday Chinese food.Well, this place certainly earn their reputation as one of the best Chinese food in Chinatown, and I can't wait to try them.  Forget about the menus, I know exactly what I wanted and of course my wife was, and always is, one step of me.Immediately before I even got my coat off, she has already ordering food from the waiter.  And soon the food just kept coming.  And boy, the food did not disappoint.Immediately when you walk through their front door, you can clearly see the roasted ducks from their display window.  And yes, we absolutely ordered that duck.  The duck was roasted to perfection.  Light and crispy skin on the outside, and the meat was juicy and flavorful.  I can easily see myself eat a bowl of rice with that, and the juice from the duck goes perfectly with a nice and steamy white rice.Since it was wet and cold at the time we were there, we ordered a bowl of the Westlake Beef Soup.  The soup was very got and tasty, nice flavor on the beef with a nice tough of the egg drops in the soup,We also ordered the Wonton soup but without the noodles.  We knew there will be a lot of food coming and we didn't want to get stuff by the noodles.  The wontons were excellent.  The size of the wontons were perfect and with a nice fillings.  I would eat a tons of them but there were more food coming.You can't come to a Chinese BBQ place and not order a Roast Pork dish.  It might sound like a simple dish, and most Chinese restaurants even in South Florida offer the same dish, but it's hard to get it right.  The pork was juicy and almost melt in your mouth.  The flavor of the pork was also very good, most of the place we tried tend to make them too sweet for our taste.  And of course, you can't leave without having some Chinese congee, or rice porridge.  I love congee and I can't seem to decide which one to order.  So of course my wife ordered three!  My favorite congee was the Salted Pork with Thousand Year Egg.  Love the flavors from the salty pork and the thousand year egg, which was soft with a neutral flavor really balances the dish  I was so focus on this congee and failed to concentrate the other two.  But I was fine with that.  Over all, we were very happy with our meal.  This is by far the best Chinese BBQ restaurant I've had for a very long time.  The food was excellent, the price was very reasonable, but...do not expect much for their service.  My goal is to come in, sat down, order my food and get out.  And we accomplished that.  Despite with their lacking on customer service, I still give them a 5 star rating because....oh yeah the food was that good. Big Wong is a Chinatown staple. Go there to quickly satisfy most of your Cantonese food cravings. Their ""rice crepes"" are pretty good. They're not that consistent, so sometimes you get very thin and well folded rice crepes so there's always a good ratio of rice crepe to filling to soy sauce. Other times the crepes can be thick and sometimes they forget half the filling. Honestly though, you're only paying $2.50 so you learn to forgive their inconsistencies. The spicy beef chow fun is the perfect carby dish to eat the day after drinking. It's not actually spicy, but more flavorful than the regular beef chow fun. It's also a massive portion so you're really getting your money's worth. The beef is very tender and delicious, I often accidentally eat all the beef first and am forced to eat the rest of the noodles with no beef :( Their staples are the 1) congee and 2) duck/chicken. The congee is a generous portion and really hits the spot if you're looking for some comfort food. The duck/chicken is comparable to some great duck/chicken I've gotten in China. It also comes with this amazing garlicky gingery paste that you can also eat with your rice. Both poultry are fatty and delicious, with just the right amount of crisp and flavor from the skin. This restaurant literally cranks these out, so make sure you get it to get the best Big Wong experience! Cash only! There's a Chase right in the corner, not more than a 2 minute walk. If you're looking for the best Roast Duck, I think I found an amazing place.  We've ordered at least 5 ducks at this point and we are only beginning.  When you first walk in, you see the roast duck, Soy sauce chicken and steamed chicken all hanging there and it's clear, it's one of their specialties.  There were at least 20+ hanging there and a line of people ordering. Each time I've gone there, I'm worried they will run out just as it's my turn to order but fortunately, they keep coming out with more fresh roasted ducks and chicken.  This last time I went, I ordered more than the duck.  I ordered the congee and the Chinese donut and I can tell you, I'm so glad I did.  The congee was perfect with the perfect amount of pork, intestines and liver.  The Chinese donut was fresh and fluffy and the perfect compliment to my congee.   I will be back to further explore their menu.  Everything that I've tried has been phenomenal, I can't wait for the next adventure. Big Wong guarantees that you get a decent Wonton soup, packed with big, juicy wonton and well-made noodle.But the star of the meal was definitely the pork chop. Oh boy, they were GOOOOOOOD. The Peking Pork Chop was soft, pleasantly sweet and goes well with the wonton noodle. The salt and pepper Pork Chop wasn't too shabby either. For around $14, you and a buddy can each get 5 pieces out of that value-for-money dish.I'm not a fan of the service during peak hour, as it was really difficult to get a waiter's attention. But I was really pleased with how I was able to meet a new friend as we crowded at the same table. On a regular day, the service is quite fast and on point.So yeah, 5 stars I come here pretty often because it's cheap, good food and fast!!My favorites to get here are roast pork rice crepe, soy sauce chicken over rice, fried cruller, congee, and duck. Recently, I started buying the whole duck (uncut) and bought buns from local supermarket and made my own Peking Duck! I found out it's so much cheaper to make it yourself than to ORDER the peking duck from the menu. I think the whole duck was like $28 and it lasts several meals. The fried cruller I like to bring home and make steamed eggs with it. All of their food is always fresh and tastes delicious! They haven't let me down. They got their ordering system down pat and your food is ready in a few minutes. I love coming back here over and over again!",https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vZ__OTn-ol_EAhVqDJWlRw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DOflU_ZBEfj5T8mhyn2NHg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/m1kaoSQcULtM8Fqc54-AEg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yvfTqMs0Zbo55W019wJq6w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RUA12A0BlbwQeEUylhnBhQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5gTetVYpVIzKXQvPX2pRug/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dXnlcurJWkG4rBkwKDASyA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NU7k4LWcTCP6993t9zVZ3A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/a2Qa9KCk-9ZF9zCj2u8nGw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1n9sO2blgCUl5i_pK9fy0A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mkIezBc2wgXZeJ8cgwd_PA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TQ0K9VRKDGkbMZKOS5gd3w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cfbn6rNWHRt8a0ztQu_hug/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IbAfbgJnbGrwLRpR79MWCw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CvNfXMAMadz6-2hu9km3Yw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MIttv7b6LA_yJvWeMBiTkw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SdxbS-3sYKuur1JMBGqs4w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-z9GL6-W0eP1wh4YLR5CpQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/52c-j1ZYoqsX_c_dF5LIJg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0L7y6o3b--nBhqzGHzqJhQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OtJUoY5ncDtsJ6lLCRalsg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/f2Q8RCwiWDYwveARrn9urg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5uCEiCdtBS8zTpHGYIVBjQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EPk5MEkgPmjri8uj20IB0A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QxgBI3Lgmkfzlqq75ZL8Uw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZvcIf6ajoogFV4GPCfXlTg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/sfOOGlaogWtSMabpRKyYaQ/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/boba-guys-new-york,boba-guys-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Coffee & Tea,Bubble Tea,NA,"By far my favorite boba place to try and I have tried plenty, since the Chinatown in Houston has over 10 different tapioca places. I wish they opened one down here in Texas!I got the matchata with boba and loved it! Not so big a fan of the strawberry matcha latte, even though it looks pretty in photos but if you're a fan of some fruit flavor in your latte, I say go for it! But I would not get it again. I would consider myself a boba connoisseur... or at least boba's biggest fan. It's safe to say that Boba Guys really comes out on top for some of the best boba I've ever had. I'm truly waiting for the day that Boba Guys opens a shop in the DMV area. (Please!) I was so excited to finally try this place on my weekend trip to the city, and it exceeded all my expectations! I came with 3 other friends, and they were just as pleased as I was. One of my friends even ordered an extra drink to go! If I could, I would have tried all the flavors. Until next time, Boba Guys!Atmosphere:This shop, in particular, was a little small with minimal seating space. We were lucky enough to snag some table space, and it was pretty cozy. I love the white walls and huge logo on the wall. They make for great photo ops.Drinks:I ordered their Jasmine Milk Tea with Tapioca Balls. (It's my staple drink to order anywhere.) The bubbles were soft, chewy, and sweet. Not frozen or overdone. The tea was on the sweeter side, but you can always ask for less. The jasmine flavor was perfect and not overwhelming.My boyfriend got the Lychee Green Tea with Almond Jelly. The almond and grass jellies here are housemade, giving it a soft texture and flavor to compliment the tea. The tea itself was fruity and milky. Delightful! Awesome boba tea like always. The cashier was super friendly and provided great recommendations. I got the coconut green tea with oat milk at 75% sweetness, should have gone to 50%. You can really taste both the coconut and green tea flavors come out. GF got the seasonal black sesame latte which also tasted good, but had more subtle flavors. We also grabbed a lavender coconut shortbread, I thought it was meh but the GF loved it. Can't wait to come back and try some of the other flavors. I've been to the Boba Guy's when I went to San Francisco. I wasn't sure that Boba Guy's was really worth the hype but it's really the best bubble tea I've ever had! I'm so happy there's a Boba Guy's in New York!I've tried mostly all the flavors and my favorites would be Classic Milk Tea, Jasmine Milk Tea, and Earl Grey. You honestly can't go wrong with any of the drinks! They're so delicious. The ordering system is quick and easy as well. I've been there when the line was out the door and I thought it wasn't such a long wait.The employees that work there are always nice and helpful as well. I like the fact that you could adjust the sweetness level, the toppings, and the milk. The space is a little small and it's usually hard finding room to sit if you're not going there during their off peak hours which can be annoying when it's cold outside but Boba Guy's is definitely worth the cold hands in the winter. The price is a little steeper compared to other bubble tea places but most other places don't use the high quality ingredients Boba Guys do. I love this place and would always recommend it! Okay. You are talking to a girl who worked at a boba shop for 5 years... I AM A BOBA EXPERT... Although there is a Boba Guys in NorCal, I never got to try when I would visit... so I decided to try it in New York and without a doubt, NO REGRAAAAATS. This was another spot we went back to because it was THAT good. I've seen a lot of people getting their strawberry matcha latte with boba and it for sure lived up to their hype. Their signature drinks can't have any adjustments but, it really didn't need any because it had the perfect amount of sweetness. The matcha and strawberry paired up very nicely. I was shooook. The boba balls were slightly sweet and chewy, just like how ALL boba should be like. It's my biggest pet peeve when boba is soggy and bland. Service was amazing. We came to this location towards closing time and they hooked it up FAAAAT on the boba! They even announced that they will be making a LA location this year!!!!! I am so excited!!! (Heart eyes emoji) I was excited to find out that they finally had a location in New York. I've always wanted to try this place, but I don't visit San Francisco/San Jose as often as I do New York.The first time I came here was on a hot summer day last summer. It's a tiny little shop in Lower East Side. The first time I got the standard jasmine milk tea with boba which was pretty good, but not the best. The second time I came was this summer and I ordered the strawberry matcha latte with boba and my oh my that was the winner for sure. It's such a pretty drink and the flavors work so well together. Plus the cups are so cute!I ended up buying a Boba Guys tote bag to commemorate the moment and I use it daily. Would definitely would recommend for all to try! This awesome little gem was on our way to the train and my Hubbs knows how much I love tea we had to stop in. I totally fell in love. The cashier was very nice and had a lovely smile with such a great attitude. Atmosphere was very hipster and you can definitely come here for a nice date. I ordered the  green tea coconut latte iced with oat milk (yes oat milk!!!!!) omg it was super delicious. My hubbs ordered a Thai iced tea and that was also very delicious. Tasted very original and had a nice bold tea flavor. Lastly we ordered a lavender and coconut shortbread cookie----WOW!!! I can honestly say I have never been a fan of shortbread cookies but these cookies exceeded my expectations. They tasted amazing and had a great crumble and a nice melt affect on the pallet. They were so amazing. I will definitely come back here on my next trip to NY! Not much to say...had a strawberry matcha with boba and it was on point!  definitely coming back to try other flavors out Hands down my favorite boba place by far. Their matcha drinks are my favorite. This includes the most instagramed strawberry matcha latte and their special mango matcha latte. Both are on the sweeter side but the matcha flavor really comes through. My boyfriend's favorite is their classic jasmine milk tea which is made perfectly every time. Their strawberry tea fresca is super refreshing as well. They also have other options besides boba like grass jelly and chia seeds. I have to get boba guys every time I go to NYC (and that's often). I'm still hoping they open up in Boston in the near future! My new found love. Boba guys makes a killer matcha latte, and the BEST part is the homemade almond jelly + grass Jelly. And the best part about this location is the servers are super nice, and will add extra jelly if you ask! (yes... I would just sit there eating almond and grass jelly if I could).The location is a bit out of the way if you don't live in LES, but is conveniently located a lot of great restaurants and eateries. That, and if you're doing the coworking thing, it's near the Spacious Cafe Medi location. I think I'm just making excuses for why I travel all the way down, and I mean ALL the way down from midtown just to get boba tea here. But hey... it's that good.Paws up, hungry (jelly-fiend) cat approves. I wish Boba Guys would come to Houston already. I've tried a couple of drinks each time I visited New York/San Francisco but this is where it all began. So far my top few drinks would be Hong Kong Style (hot or cold, depending on your mood), Strawberry Jasmine Tea Fresca, and Rose Milk Tea. I have not found another place that does a Rose drink justice aside from here because the syrup is generally too sweet or the floral taste is overpowering so it tastes like perfume almost. But here, it's just right and the fact that their boba is the right consistency? It's everything I want. The strawberry tea is the most refreshing drink they have that I have tried. There is little strawberry bits that I enjoy and it's not overly sweet so the tea gives it a good balance. I'll continue to come back and try more drinks but from the time I visited San Francisco, I didn't enjoy the Strawberry Matcha Latte and Dirty Horchata that everyone raves about. Not sure if it was just that day, the location, or really my preference. There isn't a huge selection like some other places but I kind of enjoy that as they really focus on the few drinks they do have and ensure it's quality. Most recently, I tried a specialty drink that isn't on the menu yet called Tropic Thunder with mango puree, coconut milk, and a scoop of grapefruit. It was very interesting and I actually really enjoyed it but it would taste better without the grapefruit bits. It basically tasted like mango sticky rice in drink form but not to where it sickened me. And regardless of location, the service has always been the best and they are never rude. Pretty cool boba place. It feels like you're getting ~artisan~ boba if anything. I enjoy their rose milk tea with tapioca. I like that they have options for adding almond jelly (love) , chia seeds and other fun confections. You can also choose your sweetness - I prefer quarter sugar because I don't personally like my tea too sweet. It's about $4-5 which is fine for boba. Also side note - I do hear that the lines here sometimes get super long. This is a great boba place, 5 stars for sure, but no boba ever is worth waiting in long lines for. Definitely recommend, if you're walking by and the line isn't atrocious. Ok, so the hype is real! Boba guys is legit.I ordered one of their ""off menu"" items- black sesame latte with boba. I liked that they used almond milk. The first sip I took, I didn't really like it but after a few minutes it grew on me and I really enjoyed the drink. The only thing that I didn't enjoy was the boba itself. It was a bit hard but I'm also assuming it's because I went right before the store closed. Can't wait to go back and try more flavors! Finally, somewhere in NYC where boba is actually called boba and not bubble tea. Boba Guys has always been one of my favorite boba spots in SF, so it's only natural that I love this spot equally as much. The crowd favorite, strawberry matcha latte is delicious, but often times a bit too sweet. I highly recommend the muscat oolong milk tea for those who prefer something a bit lighter. Imagine a cup of freshly brewed oolong tea, with milk and a piece of Kasugai muscat gummy candy melted in. That's exactly how it tastes like! Strong in tea flavor, milky, and fragrant, but not too sweet.Expect to pay premium prices for the drinks here. It's worth it though, trust me! Stopped by Boba Guys a few weeks ago at a friend's suggestion while hanging out in the neighborhood.  The place is pretty small with only like 3 tables, so not much seating space.  But it's pretty clean.I wasn't expecting much but I was blown away by how good it was.  I'm not a bubble tea expert; for reference, I think King Fu Tea is on the better end and think Chattime is on the lower end.  I got the 16 ounce classic milk tea with tapioca.  I think it was like $4 or $4.50 if I'm not mistaken.  The drink was pretty amazing in my opinion; you could taste the quality difference and it was overall a pleasure to drink.  Not sure exactly what it was but everything just tasted better than a typical bubble tea in a good way.  The tapioca had a nice, firm texture as well, which I appreciated.  Compared to paying like $3.50-$3.75ish for a similar drink at Kung Fu Tea, I'd prefer paying an extra dollar and getting a much superior quality drink.  I'm as cheap as it gets but that extra dollar buys you a huge upgrade.  So I'm comfortable with giving this 5 stars at present.  Maybe I'll downgrade this rating if I run into a lot of other amazing bubble tea places but I think this is the best I've had so far. Review is for studying here. Tables aren't too big but it's cozy. The pop hits playlist is loud enough to overwhelm the chatter (which there's a lot of) Ok yeah this is fun! Boba guys gives you a feeling of immense power, since you can adjust pretty much everything about your drink. I especially appreciate the ability to put the sugar level down to zero. You should do this! In addition to adding years to your life and breaking the chains of sugar addiction from around your neck, it really lets you taste the tea, which is very shockingly high quality. Seems to be one of the rare boba places that uses real high quality matcha.Tons of alternative milks to choose from. One of the only places I've seen oat milk at!!! Wow!! It's pretty tasteless but I feel hip while choosing it, so that's gotta count for something! Now I understand why my sister loves Boba Guys so much...this is some high quality bubble tea! In all my years of drinking bubble tea, I was so impressed with how my drink stood out to me. It doesn't taste generic and heavy like other typical bubble tea chains that are syrupy or/and powdery. My drink tasted very smooth, refreshing and not overly sweet. I tried the Strawberry Matcha Latte with Almond jelly. I loved how subtle and blended the flavors taste when mixed with each other. I definitely recommend putting Almond jelly in your drink - I've never had it anywhere else besides here and it tastes really good. They make it themselves in-house!I would totally come back here to try their other flavors! I also liked their speakers for music... Okay after having this for the first time ever I really think any other bubble tea place is just an utter waste of money...After dinner nearby I came here and got a really unaesthetic jasmine w/almond milk and grass jelly and it was so bitter and tasted so strongly of real green tea that I had to have a friend take a few sips to help me finish it, and then I couldn't fall asleep until 4am...it proved itself to be some good green tea. Grass jelly seems really strong though, I had some trouble sucking it up from the straw haha.My friend got the matchata and they accidentally gave her the bigger size-arbitrage! It looked pretty cool (Instagram it if you want) and tasted good, the horchata mellows out the matcha and it wasn't too sweet. I'll be getting that next time I drop by. A solid four stars for this place! The flavors are all unique and I like having the option to try different flavors each time, but the tea itself here isn't my favorite. I feel like it can sometimes taste a little on the watery side. I tried the classic milk tea the first time I came, and have since tried the matcha, horchata, and other flavors. I usually get mine with 30% (less or least depending on where) sugar and regular ice and tapioca.The actual bubbles are good and chewy but overall for the priciness it's not my favorite spot. I do stop by every time I'm in this area, though!",https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZqtHQdaAAdkjUzb55QSOLw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/sX0OjwRl4fJ8toO_AkW6oQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zOVvGYq33nBp4_RLrH-8Qw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5zO0t7wOANUs3WcJHPg56Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MFxWlYKAwyVp9aV4hZMk9w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/k3A-o6uKvGHg0S0EHX3Cnw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/t41zSIKbx4YSALhG6jj4WA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xN-llLWchFngwGV-c_OzJw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wFCsagaj8bVOwGW0ZZbPbw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HyKCfeBfzsXwQG2q3Fe20A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/R1sQDWSqqS_GmTiZM0i2ZQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_Wzn_EWQIP-fzmQAqr5dfw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-l_D-ddAKmffq5DBs7vvbA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/z13QFyn1Gv8t2RGO2acoqw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lii6ItoJI4jQ77oHCbFyHg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UqwVBOZXXXAB3ktF4vDstg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/R8hGi1SI2DhVGqeyuuKsoQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/k5lFCj8fPWlgCsRvdoL0Ww/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dXzZdd49wECWoHzra3Or9A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tYTJFMPmzPFObvsPIDmSCw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AX6M3IKH9OaiJNQTBgzuCA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jprfpLJEezbXBaerCIwRKw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gz4VF0fksDruYbt-5vnaMw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cLWXuDhb2cI70nF360NZWg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OtUfGR85jcl8Sfe-Ytt6xQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/59zmY66uDuf738JO7wTi7g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fbUa-w-xlW7oysRGdtlZ_A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TTRd1Y3UagLlzd4sewK38g/258s.jpg,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/bowery-ballroom-new-york,bowery-ballroom-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Music Venues,Performing Arts,Bars,"Easily the best venue I've ever been too. The interiors are gorgeous. There is a beautiful lounge right underneath the main stage where you can grab a drank and people watch while waiting for the show. The actual stage is small enough that you can actually clearly see the artist from most locations. I went there to see kelela and was probably the best concert I've ever been too. Bonus points for cheap and efficient coat check! Some suggestions if it's your 1st time. Wear comfortable shoes. Arrive early. They have a coat check Drinks are overpriced;12. for vodka and cranberry in an 8oz cup. Wear comfortable clothing (dress down)Be prepared to be packed in like sardines. Ladies, leave you big pocket books at home-wear a crossbody bag. Unless you are in the front or are over 6ft 2in be prepared to dodge and weave through everyone's cell phone to see. You enter and go downstairs to the bar early if you arrive early and then closer to showtime you are ushered up 2 flights of stairs to the venue where there is another bar. Not sure how much the upstairs VIP cost but well worth it if you want to sit, be comfortable, eat, drink and enjoy the show. We saw H.E.R..good live performance. This is a cool place. The sound is really good and the space is very big and well-kept. I liked the band we saw, too! There are bars spread throughout so you don't have to keep going up/down stairs for a drink. Drinks are priced pretty averagely - I paid $7 for a can of IPA.The one bartender we encountered was a bit rude, hence the -1 star. No need to be rude! Everyone there is just trying to have fun. I really liked the downstairs part - it's like a lounge area where you can relax before or after a show. I would recommend. I was very confused walking into Bowery Ballroom. We went downstairs to the bar area, thinking it was where the stage was. We had heard that the place is very small, and there was a large curtain in the back of the room, where people seemed to be clumping. We turned out to be wrong. The stage is on the street level, and this is a sort of holding area. It was a little strange, but it all made sense when they opened the doors to the main floor. The place is set up very much like Irving Plaza, but half the size. The sound system was a little screwy when we were there, for Neon Trees. Blame the venue or blame the band's mic guy (as Tyler Glenn Did), but the bass was too loud so the guitars weren't coming through. The mic also was in and out for a few songs, which was disappointing. Overall a very cool venue that hopefully was just having an off-night sound-wise. If you're into jamming to some smaller bands and musicians then you've probably found yourself all over NYC in a various assortment of venues. Not all offer the same experience and some can just be claustrophobic (I'm talking to you, Irving). A tinier location totally worthy of the trip downtown? Bowery Ballroom. Let's get to rockin'.My second time here came a couple weekends ago along with my girlfriend. We were here the first time for one of my favorite little indie bands and this second go around was for one of hers. She said it first in how much she enjoyed Bowery's set up, and when I stopped to mull it over, she was right! (A win for the GF is always a plus). There were definitely more people waiting to enter this time around, though once inside BB, things spaced out nicely. Let me just be sure to explain that the Bowery isn't going to win any award for size or space, but the way the place is laid out just works so well for a smaller venue. You'll start by heading down into the comfy lounge area. Here there are plenty of tables to sit and chill, a bar to grab a drink (come early and you'll hit happy hour), and a coat check with a clever sign reminder (see pic). This area is something truly not found at many venues, at least not to a regular ticket holder. Once the doors are opened for the stage floor, you can keep on lounging or head on  upstairs to check out your soon-to-be concert experience. With multiple entry points, this not so large area keeps traffic at a minimum with fabulous flow of peeps. You'll find a tiny bar in the back of the space and some stairs on both sides with minimal table seating overlooking the stage. It's got a classy, casual, and comfortable feel going on. When the show finally starts, the venue explodes in light and sound while still keeping things pretty darn intimate. I never felt like a sardine, and was able to get some pretty stellar pics and vids throughout. After the final note is played, a getaway is simple (gotta love those multiple stairways!). Not to be forgotten is the staff. They're kind and friendly from start to finish (a nice touch at a musical spot) and truly helps to cap off a joyous night of Bowery-ness.Overall, Bowery Ballroom might not be spatially bigger than many venues, but their set up, personable staff, and ability to carry out a memorable experience, makes this a spot I'll be returning to with excitement any time I have a reason. Rock on, Bowery! Loved it here! I go to concerts fairly often, so it's hard to believe that I only visited for the first time recently. In any case, I'm already planning my next trip back.The best part about Bowery is the layout. It's definitely not a super teeny venue, but it's not nearly as large as most other NYC venues which makes for an intimate concert experience. You can get a good view of the stage from any part of the pit, even if you are far back. And if you aren't feeling the pit you can always head to the second level and chill on one of the side balconies. Both levels have bars too.They book some pretty big names that you wouldn't expect to see in a venue this size. But because of that, tickets do tend to sell out. I'd suggest signing up for their mailing list, or going straight to the box office to snag tickets.Getting to and from the venue is a breeze because it's right outside of the path. And because the venue is fairly small you won't have to wait too long for the bathroom or the bar. I'd venture back to Bowery Ballroom without hesitation if a band I like was on the schedule! It's been years since I would trek into the city for show after show, month after month, but the memories I've got like it was just yesterday.From the knitting factory and the smaller mercury lounge, the Bowery was just one of those great bigger but somehow intimate spots to see a show.  All the mosh pits and crowd surfing, blood and sweat this place has seen.   You can feel it when you walk downstairs.All the alcohol and cocaine too...Anyway, the Bowery is an awesome venue.The end I usually like to tell a long story when I write a review, because if you're not being entertaining, then what are you being? But this one's shorter, because the reason I'm giving 5 stars here is simple: at a show I went to, there was a ticketing mixup, and the person working the ticket stand that night was beyond patient with us as we sorted everything. She didn't have to be--lord knows ticket desk folks aren't often patient like that--but she was, and at the end of it all, when we ultimately did manage to get into the show, she even wished me a happy birthday. I have no memory of showing her my ID or anything. It was pretty wild. So thanks, Bowery Ballroom, for working with an eager showgoer and being easy as hell about what was a pretty frustrating issue on our end. Highly unorganized event planning mixed with false bar promises could equal disaster so once I got over the fact that my ticket was never checked nor was my ID read for my bracelet...I got weird vibes and felt cheated. Thank deity the ballroom has wonderful acoustics. I used the balcony to avoid moshing and was happy I did. Add more bathrooms !! Loved my concert and will be back. Someone will scan my ticket next time !!! Rude doormen, pricy drinks and they blasted the heat so much.. it was very hot, almost ruined my experience.  Show was good though, and tickets were cheap. It's pretty rare to see a music venue get such a great review average, mostly due to the fact that if you're in one, you're likely to be in crowds, around drunk annoying people, possibly mean bouncers, and you probably paid a lot of money. Somehow Bowery Ballroom managed to remove all of the usual annoyances of seeing live music! The space is really well kept and beautiful in parts - I loved the big window behind the upstairs balcony bar. Very classy! It wasn't super easy to get a drink at the downstairs bar and it did get pretty warm and stuffy in there at times, but it was much better in the main room. The show I saw was well populated but the main room never felt annoyingly crowded. The sound was great and it was easy to see the stage, even for a shortie like me. Between set the band members all hung out casually in the stairwell near the merch or in the downstairs bar area. The whole night was really casual, unpretentious, and approachable even for someone who has never been there before! To top off a great show and a good night, I was thrilled to be able to stumble directly into the subway station right outside the door and zoom home easily. I'll absolutely come back to Bowery Ballroom next time a band I like is playing! Came to see one of my favorite bands, Honne, on a Friday night. I consider myself somewhat of a concert junkie, especially as of late, and this was actually my first time at Bowery Ballroom. When you enter, they check your ID, and you're led downstairs to the middle area with a horseshoe-shaped fully-stocked bar, with the actual concert hall, up the opposite staircase. The openers were playing in the hall upstairs, and we decided to get some drinks before going upstairs.Drinks at the bar were about $7, which ain't too bad, but to get people to stay after shows, they hold a happy hour, where all drinks are $2 off. Not a bad idea to keep people there, although by the end of the show, we were actually already properly in the right state of inebriation. The downstairs bar accepts credit cards, but the bar upstairs only accepts cash. $20 credit card minimum, so I recommend having one person buy the drinks, and then use Venmo. Service at the bar was pretty decent, and as previously mentioned, we managed to get a bunch of good drinks before Honne went on at 10pm.Acoustics were great, and Honne, per usual, killed it. The lighting is nice, and while there were a lot of people packed into the concert hall, it never felt overly crowded. You're always going to get the drunk patrons who kick and move around too much, but we thankfully managed to avoid them for the most part. Restrooms weren't too crowded after the show, which was very surprising to me. Would definitely see a show here again. They have some really good up-and-coming artists in their lineups, and the prices for tickets aren't too bad. Was really mad that I didn't know Bag Raiders was playing there the next night, so I'll actually have to follow their upcoming show listings. Probably one of my favorite concert venues in NYC. It's small enough that everyone has a good spot in the house, no barricade between you and the stage, but he best part of it is that General Admission includes your pick at the small tables on the 2nd floor that overlook the stage, that is, if you are there early enough! Had a great experience here watching San Fermin on December 19.What a great place to see a show.  Love the layout and feel of this place. $6-7 for beer. Excellent venue! I have been to Bowery Ballroom a handful of times. I went this week to see the ber talented, gothic, metal, electronic Davin Lynch-esque siren Chelsea Wolfe! I thought the venue was a perfect intimate space for the show. She had been at the Music Hall of Williamsburg the night before and I found this space to be a lot smaller and you could really get a good view from most angels. I came in early with cash in hand. I didn't feel like paying any stinky online fees for a day of ticket. She was recently in town and completely sold out. I was hoping this would would mean tickets available. And that they were. I took the M down to Essex and moseyed over. Showed my id for a 21 and over bracelet and then bought a ticket. Once you go in the only re-entry is for the smokers and through a different door. You enter through the bar downstairs. It's comfy down there with some couches and group seating. There's a small wrap around bar with two bartenders.I popped around the neighborhood for a slice and a quick beer before entering the show. And when I returned I made a b line to  the merch like a good little concert attendee. Wow!! Not only is Chelsea Wolfe amazing but the merch was all drool worthy from pins to totes to tees. I wanted it all. And who happens to be there but none other than Wolfe herself and Damien Echols from the the West Memphis Three . If you haven't watched the HBO series it's a must. It is not a band name....There's was so much energy in that moment. I got my tee shirt then grabbed a beer and then easily found a spot for the opening band, A Dead Forest Index then between sets people hit the bathrooms downstairs, got new drinks and ran outside for their cancers sticks. Shortly after 10 the fog machine got going. The flashlight helped the band get in position and it began....like thunder. The show was incredible from start to finish. No one talked and no one pushed. Everyone was in awe. If you have not seen Wolfe live, I would highly recommend her! And the lighting at the venue elevated the experience. The sound was fantastic and u could hear the rattling of the instrument cases at the corner of my ear. Until next time my beautiful siren! The Bowery Ballroom is a sweet venue to see bands and music acts. It's a smaller, more intimate space - from the bar/lounge area downstairs to the upstairs performance area and all the nooks and hangout spots in between. The acoustics are good here. The sound people know what they are doing. Plus, one thing that's great about the venue is that you can - depending on the act - also hear from the downstairs lounge. So, one thing that I like to do is, if I'm not really into the opening act, I can hang out in the lounge and still hear what's going on. If it catches my attention and sounds good, I can head on up. If it's meh, I can just stay where I am and hang out until the main act. The Bowery is very chill and that's the kind of atmosphere that I like when seeing a show. Also, and I kept a note to remind myself to mention this whenever I got to writing a review, the Security do a good job here. Aside from the security at the door, I never thought about security inside until it mattered. A few months ago, this dude started a fight with my boyfriend and security appeared out of no where and handled the situation really well. While I was prepared for fisticuffs, I'm glad that Security had things on lock so that everyone could still enjoy the evening. Lastly, it's so easy to get here by subway (your options are J/Z at Bowery, B/D at Grand, or F at Delancy - all are within walking distance). You can't go wrong with seeing a show at Bowery Ballroom! Went to watch the Revivalists last night as my boss had a lot of tickets and the son of one of the partners at our law firm is in the band. The venue is nice but it was REALLY crowded and the bar is tiny on the main stage floor (second). The bartenders were all nice and there were A LOT of drunk people and people were stepping all over my foot. I was dying to get out of there and was glad I did, but to be completely fair - the venue itself is nice. I'm in love with this venue! A friend pulled some strings and got us VIP tix to Marina &amp; the Diamonds for the first show on her new tour. Even if you're not in the VIP section, though, the venue is so intimate that there really isn't a bad place to stand. Unless you want to be way up front, I would actually recommend skipping the wait in line outside -- it's a pretty creepy sidewalk/construction area -- and arrive closer to the start time. The staff is very nice, and the acoustics are good. I'd love to return for another show sometime! The Bowery is unlike any venue I've ever been to!Went here to see ""The-Dream"" who is a pretty A-list artist and I was surprised to find that he was performing at a place like this for such a great price. So of course I was skeptical...But fear not! The space was intimate and surprisingly it was sold out but I wasn't packed in on top of other people and I could actually leave my spot and run to the bathroom and not have to elbow my way back to the front.Coat check was a quick and easy since I arrived about 30 mins early or so and then the boo &amp; I were able to chill out at the downstairs bar area until show time. The upstairs bar is CASH only, the downstairs bar is $20 min for cards. Downstairs is dimly light with a few spots for seating at the bar and small table sections on the sides and the concert space is upstairs. Also, the bathrooms were well kept, which is a big deal at concerts/bars. The sound system was amazinggg, and I had a great stress-free time and I'd definitely return. This is a nicely kept venue, it is not dingy. There is a bar up in the balcony for people to chill.",https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/43ffuZVoJCfTDO7fFXhYIA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bl56ZqusrDwSo7xHOC_Evw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/iujfm2ABI1Cjq1D42L72ug/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/J2X-GJ0xUtTq4jVqursMkA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9Xxs5fRwxSfhg04cOh5DDA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Wdlhx4ZS2IfDRqyr009RoQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/J-vJxxE2anH3xvChzA9VcA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QAidOx-JcD0m9G-3fg4wHw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nAfSNAshM-L7epClTb1alQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ryOrp1_uOEUi4x_jPPUYmg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/l5eyQnYQz2bm7vRXgh3hJQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/X8QS1l3rEj-U_h6qUfet8Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/N5uzoRGb-VtVwU7qI9UBjQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/quyWAgE_7I-ZHkjzFfC54Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CsFIfFsvdGmqD5hqeSi4cg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uOmQH7RCw9MJjVs7O6x_Zw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/H2Bkw5fYGDO9OSzuE-3R4w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HVxB-3c7LYS9dLkKOw7FtQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Ywt9UxPBRXillZXk7Ps0iA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ceE7FdfoEw1AlnM7oHveKQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7PScfnLgwLsDzG-994k-mQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_zi2LIopT02n_y72I8Vq_A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EaorvGHH4Gs84jHKO82R_Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uvK0aQZdbQcxvHyeai_4pA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Z4AHfkVi-yQbj1WruLIAWw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/r7GgeberyUKEvrlGUzKYqw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8LBnO6Whj0qFp7LgQ98clQ/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/cafe-habana-new-york-4,cafe-habana-new-york-4,New York,10002,NY,Cuban,Mexican,NA,"Cafe Habana was such a gem! It was a cute little cafe and the food was amazing!  I had a plate with grilled chicken, tostones, and the spicy spinach. I also ordered a cafe con leche that came in a milkshake glass. Everything was delicious.I didn't have to wait for a table during lunch time on a Monday, but I bet weekends are packed because the space is small. Our waitress was very friendly. The price was very reasonable, especially since the plates came with a lot of food.I will definitely be returning! It doesn't hurt that it's near great shopping in Soho! Came to this spot after hearing everyone rave about it. And it is pretty good. I got the chicken tortilla soup-it has no chicken in it. It's all chunks of cheese which was misleading..but whatever that's cool. Had other dishes. Weren't quite memorable. Definitely get that corn!!!!! I plan to go back to the shop right next to get the corn to go lol it's so good! But definitely you should floss afterwards, lol Best high-end Cuban sandwich in the Northeast.I was heartbroken when Chez Henri in Cambridge, MA shut its doors in 2013, as the Northeast was cut off from its supply of chichi Cuban sandwiches.  Fear no more, as the Cuban sandwich at Cafe Habana may be just as good!To be fair, the sandwich does stretch the rules of a Cuban sandwich just a bit, as marinated shredded pork (amazing) replaces the canonical sliced roasted pork.  Toasted bread crunches thunderously, giving way to an explosion of sweet-salty flavor; beware of dripping juices at the back of the sandwich.  Mustard notes are pretty light - pretty interesting that Cafe Habana offers Grey Poupon instead of the standard yellow stuff.Mexican corn two-pack is a must-try.  The mole, while pretty reasonable, is an afterthought in comparison. I can't believe I have never been here till now. I am not particularly fond of cuban/Mexican food though I was craving some corn tonight so I suggested to a friend. It was fairly empty as we were early and the food came quickly. I KNOW WHY PEOPLE GET THE CORN. It was done so well even as a person who's not completely into corn was like I can have another one. I asked them to have the chilli powder on the side as I do not eat spicy but man that corn... We also had the grilled shrimp taco and it was good. I am always worry about it being overcooked but it was done right.I would come back for the corn any day. I recently caught the cuban/latin food bug after my trip to Miami. Cafe Habana is a rather small restaurant with no obvious signage of the establishment's name. Cafe Habana is located on the corner of the block. I ordered the two most popular items on the menu: the corn and the cuban sandwich. I very much enjoyed the corn- I wish it wasn't as pricey as it was, as I wanted to order more. The cuban sandwich was pretty solid- the pork was moist and flavorful. I was pretty content with my food and restaurant selection. It's a solid choice if you want a really good cuban sandwich. East coast Cuban food is always better than west coast. I must agree! When we were in NYC, we made a trip to Cafe Habana in SoHo for their mind blowing Cuban sandwich and Elote corn. For those of you unfamiliar with the Cubano, let me explain: it's ham, pickles, mustard, swiss cheese and roasted pork (yes, twice the pig!) on Cuban bread and then pressed so that the bread toasts and the cheese melts. Elote is Mexican street corn roasted over an open grill and coated withsalt, cayenne powder, butter, Cotija cheese, lime and mayo.These 2 delicacies are my favorites and I've been here many times. I'll always come back and order the same items because they're so delicious and they'll never mess it up. Service was great and quick. Love this place! 3 for okay food.3 for okay service.3 for okay ambiance. 3 for okay environment.5 for the best elote-- Mexican corn !I've been coming to this restaurant since 2008, so I've seen it evolved into an expensive tourist attraction whose prices skyrocketed for what the meal is worth. In 2008 I probably would've given this place a 5; it was novel, it was hip, but most importantly it was affordable.As someone who loves good food to be accessible, I was surprised to see how much the prices have changed. The corn/elote was $10 for 2 pieces of corn. Wow. Wow. Sunset Park and East Harlem have very good Mexican restaurants that you can go and get great elote at for $5. This restaurant is capitalizing on its neighborhood. That's fine. I just won't be coming back.I had the avocado and cheese torta. Avocado  is typically always good-- $13.95 worthy? Definitely NAH. The highlight of it was the chipotle mayo sauce. I would suggest that it goes with the sandwich as a dip, so I can dip my french fries in it too. French fries were okay, nothing spectacular. I've also had the Huevos Rancheros and they're a 3.5/5 <U+200D> because they're pretty basic and standard. There's nothing incredibly special about them. And the red sauce isn't amazing &amp; it should be the major highlight of the dish, but it's OK. Just okay.I used to rave about this place, But after being back, I wonder if I was just a young person in New York who was excited to eat something new and it became my spot and go to place because there were so many people talking about it. It was all the rage. After coming here for about 10 years, it's just OK. It's a solid meal. But it's not worth the money. There are too many other Cuban restaurants in New York City that I could get a good meal for the same price for, so hasta luego! Renee eats Cuban Cute little place on prince street. Has a diner feel to it with cute decorations. Came here for late weekday lunch so the place wasn't crowded, which is not surprising. Seated immediately and orders were taken immediately, service was very quick. Waitress was friendly enough but seemed like she was just there to do her job. I ordered the Cuban sandwich which was written to be the ""Best in NYC"". It did not disappoint. Pressed to perfection, definitely did not skimp on the pork. The chipotle mayo was a good touch and a perfect amount. The ham and cheese were also delicious (personally I thought it could've had more cheese). The fries were also amazing, thick cut like I like them and not burnt. Overall a great experience and would return again! Honestly, came by this spot bc Egg Shop had over an hour wait. Sad times. So the eggy wants was strong. And I don't eat meat, soo let's straight with those two caveats. Sunday brunch at 11:30am is a tough time to get seated, but not here. It was great. Except that the seats were REALLY cramped. We had a group of four, and one chair literally flowed into the bathroom area - making for a very awkward seating arrangement. Service was also limited. I saw the waitresses running around and giving at least two tables the incorrect orders. Feels a bit understaffed, but they got a majority of our order correct. Except the side of bacon my friend got. Didn't come til we were already done eating everything else. For the main entree, I ordered the Huevous a la Mexicana (veggie egg scramble) which came with home fries. And we got the corn to share for the group. Let's talk about this corn. Bc it was everything and then some. It's the messiest most delish thing you're gonna have in this joint! Okay, but back to the scramble. It's just not my jam. The eggs scrambled w the veggies this way tastes over cooked. And it's completely under seasoned. This is one of those times when I'm like okay, it's not my restaurant bc I don't eat meat. But I should've gotten the fish tacos. Welp, if I ever come back that's what I'll do. I def would never come back here craving any sort of egg breakfast sitch. But for the corn alone, maybe. 3 stars. This is a go-to brunch spot or for any matter, a go-to food spot!! So great for casual dining with friends.Food:Diverse menu with good vegetarian options and good prices. I've had the tacos al pastor and chorizo con papas, both which were tasty, flavorful and filling. My friend constantly gets the torta de queso blanco y aguacate, which is vegetarian. They make a bomb iced cafe con leche here as well!! Service:Fast and friendly service for a place that's often crowded. Ambiance:It's hip, colorful and inviting. A bit diner style. They keep the windows open on nice days and I love that. On a great corner location right in Nolita so the surroundings are always bursting with energy.Etc:My only complaint is that 1)the wait can get long because it's popular 2)there's a gap between brunch and dinner where they close up to prepare for the transition!! Their Cuban sandwich is amazing. So tasty and fresh. I love how chill the restaurant is during the weekday. We sat at the counter and ate our hearts away. We ordered the steak, the Cuban and the corn (gotta have the corn), and many delicious drinks. It was such a filling and satisfying lunch we didn't even want dinner. But all so worth it. A group of us are driving in New York to a wedding. My friend was almost-drooling as she talked about how amazing Cafe Habana is. I think she talked about Cafe Habana for 20 minutes straight. I thought to myself - I have to try this place! This was 3 years ago. Since then, I have been to Cafe Habana countless times for lunch, dinners, or stop by just to eat their delicious Mexican corn. Cafe Habana is known for their Cuban sandwiches, and grilled Mexican corn.Their Cuban sandwiches are juicy savory slices of roasted pork, stuffed with ham and swiss cheese. It is heavenly. The grilled corn is blackened sweet corn-on-the-cob rolled in mayo, cotija cheese and sprinkled with chili powder and lime. Their caipirinhas are strong. This is one of the best places to have a dinner in the Soho area. Be prepared to wait for the diner portion. Omg! If you're in the city this is a must!! Cuban sandwich and elotes!! That's all you need to know!! This place is okay borderline 3 stars. I'm not a huge fan of diner looking places, but since this place has almost 3K reviews, I thought I'd try it. The prices online and on site are different. One of the server was singing and dancing, which liven the place up a little. The service was good though. My bf had the chorizo con papas, which he said was great. He thinks this is one of the top 5 brunch places. Huevos Rancheros ($12)- 2/5 The online place says this plate was $6.95 but at the actual place it's like $12. Definitely not worth it in my opinion. Everything was very 'wet' and soggy. I didn't even touch the home fries. I didn't even know there was corn tortillas because it was all soggy under the eggs. Grilled Corn Mexican Style- 4/5 This was pretty good, but also a bit messy. Good thing they give you toothpicks with it! They didn't add too much mayo, and had a good amount of cheese and spice on it to give it a slight kick. The place is super small and looks like it would have a massive line during big hours. We split the Mexican style corn and Baha Fish Tacos. The corn was awesome and messy and the tacos were quite good. There is not a lot of room in the place or on the table. A great tiny place with good, simple, and honest food. Well worth the tight space. Very very good food and I definitely want to continue coming here. Seating is a little hard here and it can get stuffy but their cuban sandwich is WORTH IT. It's quite filling and I actually shared one with a friend. Perfectly toasted bread with melted cheese...a hearty, warmness in each bite!Seems like I missed out on the corn though - come to California please! Passed by here all the time and finally decided stop in today and try the food. I've seen a few sites and publications that they had the best Cuban sandwich in NYC and decided to see for myself. We got seated and ordered, food came within 15 minutes which was extremely fast! The sandwiches were pretty thick, bread was the toasted the right duration so crispiness was great. The sandwich itself was phenomenal. There was a generous amount of pork and the ham were both very juicy. The fries were hand cut and slightly crispy. Sandwich was very filling and well worth the $15. I would venture back here next time as I heard the grilled corn is suppose to be superb as well. My friends and I were shopping in Soho and decided to eat dinner here on a whim. The place is like a tiny diner, which I thought was so cute! Our waiter was really nice and did a great job of checking up on us despite how busy the restaurant was. I honestly don't remember the name of what I ordered and I didn't see it on the PDF version of the menu, but I remember it being some sort of delicious meat in a mole sauce (maybe chorizo?) with a side of rice and beans. It really hit the spot, and it was at a great price too!  I definitely would not be opposed to coming here again. Another ""must visit"" spot on my NYC Foodie list. I came here several years ago when visiting a friend in NYC for NYE and to this day I have NOT found a better Cuban sandwich or grilled street corn. So naturally, on my most recent trip to NYC, I made my way to Cafe Habana for lunch. With a constant flow of customers and the quaintest corner spot on Prince Street, I knew I had returned. I grabbed a spot at the counter and my tastebuds began to dance. Of course I started with an order of grilled street corn: mayonnaise slathered over grilled corn and coated with queso fresco and chili powder. YUM. YUM. YUM. One order comes with two ears of corn ($9) and I proudly ate both. As much as I wanted to stray from my typical order of a Cuban sandwich to try their brunch menu, I couldn't resist temptation. The Cuban came out the classic masterpiece that it is... thick, crunchy bread to support the perfectly seasoned, melt-in-your-mouth pork ... all coated in cheese and mustard and pickles and ham. Ladies and gentleman, you won't find a better Cuban anywhere. Even in Cuba (pure speculation). So if you've never experienced Cafe Habana, you don't know what you're missing.",https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/q3UijyLKWvRCr3OuZHvb8Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QBL7PpkajSW5h2SGxtDvhg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/U1lZoyZU9GUP3mHygph5ww/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/t6OHB-R7bn7ME0gzM2Ep8g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QQF1Ak3E6r4hOdshw1N_9w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/sumorU-iz_aYJMPleJoI8A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/t37RaUYDrQALYUBdluDPoA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Px8yzdIO8-sdXf4KYhVLYQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Gf5QVhj5P39j4n1rZ-W58g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bG409rlCxnAk_bN_xzi8Dw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gyQ9luDks5kEHl_2sPPrCA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qDRbhzv2TpqIkYQHkGAQBA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KIPA5NvB-EKKq_7QxEoUPg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CB9Rasu-eR1f1PnRuS8WPQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/740RaPk_7fyuEQnUWEVw1Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Q94LdxR2r6eSS1zZHr4bOQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WqB0VR1tIAj07qyo3oksqg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tX2e3lVDPWBFuRAzSf2bFA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3YDwOmizJZjGOalY-1nnNA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bDEsIm7IRv1f6vZc17I4yg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/plOzKgeD3hVVmPVHLknxww/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/w3C0eLvLMba2rGABQkFyvQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IKYRLc2nUtQxmYRIfzZnQg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OYv40xj8CN8CiEJVPP0fSg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IoCoRyCEuU6NHcEXDYxJlQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/A2o1U0ssEXaZOLT7nQjxYg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_YvzCX8DxXXz1lmW25oeJQ/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/cafe-himalaya-new-york-2,cafe-himalaya-new-york-2,New York,10002,NY,Himalayan/Nepalese,NA,NA,"What a pleasant surprise to find this place! We ordered mostly vegetarian dishes, and it was best vegetarian food I've ever had. Each dish was savory and rich with the flavors of the vegetable ingrediants, and the dishes had variations on the distinct regional spicy-sweet flavor. We ordered one dish per person, and shared the dishes and rice family style. A friend who spent a part of his life in the Tibet region said that the food really tastes like home (although a bit less spicy than the food he had in Tibet--I found the spice level to be medium and perfect). Service was quick as well.The smoothies are great, and pair nicely with the spicy food. Chili Dofu (tofu dish) and Tsel Shesha (mushroom dish) were my favorite entrees--so rich in flavor. The rice pudding for dessert was better than any rice pudding I've previously had--perfect consistency and not too sweet, with raisins and bits of fruit on top. It's a tiny restaurant in lower east side and you can get very cheap food here. We wanted to try both Tsel Momo(vegi momo) and Shogok momo (potato &amp; herb). They said they can give us mixed one which was nice. So we got 4 pieces of each. I liked Vegi momo more because the flavor was better than potato momo. It was a good choices. We also had Tsel Gyathak Ngopa (sauted noodles with vegetables and tofu) and it was just okay for me. I just didn't like the flavor because it was new for me. Maybe I would like more next time. It's a small restaurant but it's pretty popular. We came here around 2 and the tables were almost full. I recommend Tsel Momo (vegetable momo)! I will come back here to try new food! I went to Cafe Himalaya for lunch this past weekend.  It is a small place where you seat yourself.  Very no frills.We were very torn between which momos to get, and also if we wanted Thukpa (a noodle soup), Tsel Gyathuk Ngopa (sauteed noodles) or Tsel Gyathuk Takpa (pan fried noodles).  The waitress was extremely helpful and gave great service.  We were torn between Tsel Momo and Shogok Momo Takpa, and she let us have half of each, which was great. And she explained to us that the sautees noodles were coated in sauced while the pan fried were not.We ended up going with the half and half momo and with the sauteed Tsel Gyathuk Ngopa.  The noodles were really tasty.  They had an unusual flavor that I liked.  The momo were not the best I've ever had, but they were solid.  I wished the potatoes in the Shogok Momo Takpa had a bit more chunkiness or texture to it. The flavor was good, but a bit too mushy for me.  The Tsel Momo was definitely the best.And the prices were very reasonable as well.  For the two dishes we spent under $20.00, which is a great deal for New York City. I don't know if I'd go back unless I was in the area.  Jackson Heights still has the best Himalayan food, but Cafe Himalaya makes a great meal! Cafe Himalaya is an amazing find in the East Village.  The small cozy restaurant is perfect for a quick, cheap, and delicious meal. Their soups are perfect for the winter time with my favorites being the Thang (tofu, noodles, ginger, and tomato's) or if your prefer meat the Chasha Thang. A must try are their Sha Momo dumplings. They come steamed or fried and packed with meat. All in all Cafe Himalaya is a perfect place if you're looking for a quick meal at a very affordable price. While it can get crowded, the service is very fast and you won't be waiting long. What you need to know: - there are only 28 seats for this tiny restaurant and it gets crowded after 6:30pm - accepts credit cards, but only one per table - an excellent choice for vegetarians (and meat eaters!) - menu has extensive vegetarian options - this tiny restaurant gets EXTREMELY loud, we were literally screaming to one another across the table - BYOB What we ordered: - Avocado Salad price $5.75 - do yourself a favor and GET THIS!!!!! Himalayan style spiced and seasoned potato and avocado in lemon dressing.  My eating companion said these spices sang in her mouth and is seasoned perfectly.  A seemingly simple dish but is absolutely fantastic! The spices are not hot spicy but gives your mouth an explosion of flavor. This remains our favorite dish! - Tsel Phing $9.99 - bean thread noodles sauteed with spinach, cabbage, carrots, peas and comes with one paratha bread.  The noodles and the veggies were cooked well and was filling, even though the portions are not too large. It is even better with the spicy red sauce they provide! - Tsel Shesha $9.99 - sauteed mushroom, broccoli, zucchini, carrots and spinach - comes with a bowl of basmati rice.  The veggies were cooked well (not too crunchy or mushy) and was more savory than spicy. Before I start, this is my first review (and I promise I am not a fake). I use yelp religiously to figure out what and where to eat, so after finding a few great places I've decided it's time to ""give"" back. It's just a typical boring Tuesday night and I needed dinner. I've been attempting to try new things &amp; stumbled upon Cafe Himalaya. The reviews and pictures seemed enticing. I took a deep breath, and submitted my order. Less than an half hour later, the food arrived. I ordered the Sha Momos (pan fried beef dumplings) and Tsel gyathuk Ngopa (veggie and tofu sauted noodles). Both dishes were delicious. The momos were juicy &amp; tasted fresh (the cabbage salad was a nice addition as well). The noodles weren't greasy, they were nice and chewy. I wish there were more hearty veggies (I woulda killed for broccoli) but they were still very filling. The hot sauce was also very tasty (I'm not big on spicy, but a few drops added great flavor). I won't say I was blown away, but being in the east village and living in fear of bad, dirty, greasy Chinese / Thai / Japanese Food this place really will stay at the top of my list for when I want some dumplings and noodles. #12. Tsel Momo (Steamed) 5/5These guys are a little on the bland side but totally amped up by the red sauce served on the side (looks spicy but it's not that spicy. Use it liberally Mix it with the soy sauce get crazy wid it) #19 Chili Dofu (5/5)Perfect amount of spice. Great amount of veggies piled on there. Don't fear the oily, embrace the oily, get extra rice for that oily#17 Tsel Gyathuk Takpa (5/5)Not vegan oops they use egg noodle. Small place though, just bring 1 trusty eating companion here A-ok defines this place pretty well.  This is definitely a ""blink and you'll miss it"" kind of place since it's tucked away on 1st St with inconspicuous signage.  We stumbled upon this place and just had to try.  We ordered the Gyathuk Ngopa, Chasha Shamdey, and Paratha to share.  I'll start by saying the portions here are on the smaller side.  The noodles were definitely a regular sized portion but the curry and paratha were both barely enough for one person!  However, the prices are very reasonable and the service is quick, so if you're still hungry, it won't break the bank.  In addition to the smaller portions, the flavor was just not present.  Thinking back on this meal, I can't remember any identifiable flavor except grease.  Am I mad I tried this spot?  No.  Would I go back again?  Probably never. This place is a gem. Great, fresh food and great prices! Cafe Himalaya is super vegetarian friendly, however they also have non veg dishes here. I just want to say though, I have had tofu in every way, shape, and form throughout my life and have disliked it until I had CH's Spicy Tofu. It's my favorite! I like it with their version of a Paratha. Also, $4 glasses of wine here make me very very happy :) i'm bettin' u ain't had Tibetan...hello Dalai!small dining room. very casual and simple. small tables. stripped down decor. perfect for solo eating or very casual meals.the dishes are balanced between vegetarian dishes and non-vegetarian dishes.the offerings range from soup to salad to noodle to rice entrees. the food has a good amount of spices and spiciness without being overpowering.PRO TIP: the lunch special is fairly generous amount of food for $7.50. served noon to 4pm.the pan-fried dumplings are quite tasty whether you get vegetarian or meaty ones. the dishes are like a cross between chinese/indian without the greasy or curry elements. the food is comforting yet has very simple elements. i prefer the sauteed/pan-fried noodle dishes here to the rice dishes. i really like the vegetarian ones like the Tsel Gyathuk Ngopa. there's a nice selection of fruit smoothies to choose from in terms of beverages--all under $5.drops mic for some comfy eatsi outzz One of the best fusion restaurants, the food speaks volumes of the Asian/Nepalese flavors. From spicy pan fried potato dumplings( No.13) to vegetarian noodles (no.16), this place has all the bearings to become a cult favorite. Drinks were surprisingly cheap (Merlot $4), then again it is not an ideal location and the street has a desolated vibe. But hey, taste matters.If you have a low threshold to spice, ask them for recommendations. And please if you order a take out, be careful as it will probably leak. In our case it was the noodles!, the oil completely drained and thankfully inside the bag. I came here on a Saturday night before a night out with my girlfriend. I decided on Himalayan/Nepalese because it had been quite some time since I had had it, and my girlfriend never had. We arrived around a bit past 18:30 and thankfully found a few tables open, at which point we got the table next to the window for people watching. Why people will get at the end of a 30+ person-deep line at a pizzeria is beyond me; maybe they just really like pizza. The ambience consists of a moderate light level, not dim to the point you have trouble seeing, not bright to the point it stings, the tables and chairs don't feel like they're made out of particleboard, and there are some assorted framed photos from the Nepal / Himalayan region on the walls. When Karen L. says this place gets loud, she was not kidding, so if you want a quiet dining experience, look elsewhere.Anyway, the waiter spoke English just fine, so if you are new to this kind of food, you should not have the problem with some restaurants like this where the waiter speaks maybe three words of English, and God help you if you ask for recommendations or any type of question. I ordered the Shapta (#41), choosing the rice because I was hungry and apparently its portion size is bigger than the paratha option, which the waiter said was the more traditional option, and my girlfriend got the Gyathuk Ngopa (#29). Upon the food's arrival, we were not disappointed.My Shapta was mildly spicy, not bland, nor was it spicy to the point it makes you sweat, which I love and routinely eat. I thoroughly enjoyed it, really savoring the generous beef portions and the ample ginger in the sauce. My girlfriend is the antithesis regarding my love of spicy food, we forgot to specify to go easy on the spices for her Gyathuk Ngopa, but she was able to enjoy it without issue. It came with a little serving dish of a red sauce that was moderately spicy and extremely heavy on the cilantro. It went quite well on my rice.Random comments; they take credit cards (Visa and Mastercard if I heard the waiter correctly), which a lot of small Asian restaurants don't, there is a single restroom in the basement, the Yelp prices reflect the actual menu prices, which is a huge pet peeve of mine when they are inaccurate, and when descending the stairs, you had better pay attention to that ""Watch Your Head"" sign, because unless you're 5' tall, you will smash your head against the ceiling towards the bottom of the stairs if you don't duck.In summation, if you want something other than overpriced bar food or pizza and you are in the Houston St. area, I highly recommend this place. In following tradition of trying different foods each week, my friends and I decided to try out Tibetan food. We were not sure what to expect but have heard good things about this place. The place itself is easy to miss and to be honest it does look a bit dingy from the outside. Inside the place is pretty small, but we got there just as some of the customers were leaving so we did not have to wait for seats. The people working were extremely nice and friendly. The menu is split up with a section for vegetarian dishes and another for dishes with meat. None of us are vegetarian so we went straight for the meat dishes. There were quite a lot of options for meat dishes which was great for us. Food wise: -Gyathuk Takpa with beef: The noodles were wonderfully flavored and was delicious. The only compliant I have about this dish is that since the noodles are fried it was a bit hard to eat it since they were not malleable. However, the fried noodles were crispy which I also really liked. -Gyathuk Ngopa: This dished used the same type of noodle as Gyathuk Takpa but the noodles were not fried, making them a lot easier to eat as well. All my friends that got shrimp said it was delicious so def. try it out! -Chasha Shamdey: I got to try a bit of this curry and it is pretty good, not really spicy but pretty flavorful.  -Paratha: This is def. a must get, it is super fluffy and so good especially with the curry. -Mango Lassi: This was super yummy and creamy!! Trying new types of food has always been a hit or miss but this place is def. a hit! Forgettable Asian food. Came in at 530 pm on a Wednesday , place started to slowly fill up by 7.  Avocado and potato salad was a tasty appetizer . The main dishes were disappointing - chili chicken was chewy and bland.  From the time we received our dishes to finishing them , the waitress did not come over again and left us with dirty plates for probably 30 minutes.  The price point is great but with the quality of food and chilly service I would not return. Love this place. Good is good and cheap. My friend brought me here a few years ago and every time we came the food is pretty consistent. I was pretty sad when I thought they had closed out, but they haven't. Can't wait to go back. Very solid restaurant offering a wide range of vegetarian and non vegetarian options. We had the vegetarian pan fried noodles and it was great - super crispy with the vegetables and tofu bringing a lot of flavor on the top of the noodles. The other choice was a traditional vegetarian curry that was good but not quite remarkable. By the way it looked I guessed there was a lot of seasoning going on there but it tasted a little flat. We also had pan fried dumplings with potatoes and beef - those were really good, way above average especially because they manage to make the crust very crunchy. Prices are very decent and the service is good and fast. I LOVE THIS PLACE. Small but AMAZING food! I have been going there for over ten years and haven't found Tibetan/Nepalese food like it anywhere else. Came here during the month of Saka Dawa, meaning it was vegetarian only. As a big lover of meat, admittedly, I was a bit sceptical.To start, we had the Momos, which are little vegetable dumplings that come with various chutneys and dips. These were pretty good, and have a vegetable samosa kind of vibe.We had the crispy chilli tofu which had great flavour, and a good amount of spice. The paratha bread was also the best paratha bread I've ever had. The main attraction for this place is that it's really cheap. You can easily get a substantial meal for two for $30!Will definitely be back, when its not Saka Dawa, so i can get myself some MEAT! Such a casual, afterwork dinner spot. Chill date spot, after shopping around the neighborhood spot. Really this place is good for almost any occasion. Just don't come in expecting a 5 star, super fancy, quick service restaurant. This place is perfect for what it is, just stumble in and you won't regret it. Came here with a friend after work and the space is small which I don't really mind. Once we were seated we were both comfortable. They were pretty busy on a Friday night so it did take what felt like over 15 mins before our orders were taken. Ordered the steamed beef dumplings and the chili chicken, both were delicious. The chili chicken wasn't overly spicy and well seasoned, full of flavor. Portion was great af most of all the prices were so cheap! To be located in the east village business must be booming with those cheap prices! My bill was about 22 dollars for both the chili chicken and dumplings before tipping. Definitely plan on coming here again to try out some of their other menu items. I had the Sha Momo beef dumplings to go. Overall they were juicy and savory. It could have used some sauce / condiments, but it was meaty and delicious. The dumplings are big, but you will probably want an appetizer or side dish for a full meal. Worth a try if you need a casual meal and you are in the area. I would try the vegetarian dumplings next time.",https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lHBhInQlokZPCJXXWAyqQg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/F78VrxNr4w21l64s4aaPZw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_G29JghJJiQ3_pQr0gPQ_Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TpHehQCIaNs-ah-_-aESwg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/shpxRfgjcTZCUeeCUKhzow/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/aTS0SLJceXNqjdlNvVpHBA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BmYMNKy0ysjMF2lwyOApqg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wr4tPg69e1wxRwggCX7fZw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Mwmij6Ls2d88Y7XqRbYwqA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Swj64mpJ2bJoSBY-3CFMRw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Diwg8FGuv_OriTgYvClPMA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vyNg_RnveSzuxuX9xapuGQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QaOaHDR-8EYxjvhSRl_Ckg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TTOtw9CaM3zXxAcRLN81vw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XQnTE2FPk77QHVcxFUVZMg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_xR6BYELpWj4s7u3iOjzTA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/N7nFTdleu5-mpNayOFz6HA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oTsb4W-qy6NlJ3tAdAOZIA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gycykbXUcVaZD3EF-D8IAQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FnaooL6itEzP6PyXFT5gZQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tamU1oSHmpv8erkpYT4gmQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EX7q9oUjledzyrScuHl_-Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mtZ8nPtuewTDEVbQcxbI4Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KCS59gmwrZllq68hAz8sXw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dn7yPt-RRxndFhvXgPHaQQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CXeM4grEQ7P3mqvB7WoGww/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FKuCTYcfSUnHCtYPnGnx3g/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/cafe-katja-new-york,cafe-katja-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Pubs,German,Austrian,"Cafe Katja was awesome! Loved the ambiance and the manager (I think?) or server was super helpful.My brother ordered the berner wrstel, which he loved. My parents shared a sausage sampler, which they enjoyed, but they aren't huge sausage people to begin with, so their favorite part was the cheese dumplings. Also, that's just a lot of meat. I ordered the hummus and ratatouille which is vegan (no substitutions or changes necessary)! It was wonderful and someone even came by to bring me more crostini. They also cooked up some veggies meant for a pasta dish (I think?) which were a m a z i n g. Everyone at my table wanted a bite and I did not want to share. We had a great time and they treated us so well :) We will be back soon! Had dinner on a cold winter night here. Place was quite and cozy as it was mid week. Ordered the Goulash with a beer. Very tasty and filling portion which had especially good sauce. Also had the cheese sausage. For desert we had a strudel with apples and grapes inside, on the side was the Kluge. Would come back again. We had such a nice experience at Cafe Katja.  I don't remember how I first heard about it, but I had been wanting to come here for a while.  We finally did.Although it may be true that they are located a little out of the way, that's why I like going out to eat in the Lower East Side.  It's not as touristy and has better quality establishments.I spent a year in Austria, and I really like Austrian food.  It's hard to find that cuisine in the US.  Turns out one of the owners is in fact Austrian.  The other owner's wife was our hostess/server.  She was just so nice and accommodating!  Best service in ages!What really impressed me was that they have Stiegl on tap, and it was not only VERY FRESH, but it was also served in the appropriate glass, as it is in Austria.  They also have a wine list with each of the major Austrian grape varietals, including Welsriesling, Zweigelt, Grner Veltliner, and Blaufrnkisch, which are very hard to find outside of Austria. Came here with 3 other friends on a Friday night around 7 pm. There were open tables so I didn't need a reservations. I just came back from Eastern Europe and wanted to try out the Austrian food in manhattan. It's ... somewhat authentic. My friends got the Ruben which was obviously more of an American dish. Heavier on the cream and the cheese. I got the Austrian meatballs which were good. Lots of pepper and very tender! My bf got the weiner schnitzel and we both thought it was alright. A little dry and there were a lot of air bubbles. Also huge beers for $8-9! I enjoyed the service! The owner or restaurant manager is personable and seems like a real Austrian. Cafe Katja is an LES classic, and I have no idea why it took me so long to finally grab a meal there. Actually, I do know why - Austrian food is rarely the first cuisine I default to when considering a culinary destination. Despite not having a palate that automatically gravitates towards Central European fare, I do gravitate towards homey, welcoming restaurants that are a rare breed around New York nowadays. The room has a whimsey and charm that a lot of newer restaurants in the neighborhood don't possess. You can't force it, it has to happen organically over the span of a decade with warmth trickling down from the top. The staff are wonderful. It's worth going just to grab a drink at the bar to be near these lovely people. The food is heavy - sausages, potatoes, schnitzels, etc... There's no denying that. But you can also dive into lighter options as well if you're watching your figure. Good thing winter is approaching, as this is the perfect hearty meal to get through long, cold nights in the city. This restaurant has it all - wonderful food, ambiance and service. My friends and I visited last night at 6pm. It's good we came early, because  it was packed by 7:30pm. The atmosphere is rustic and cozy - perfect to visit on a cold night. We were seated at a long table so, you can interact with other patrons. Our server was so nice and checked on us at even intervals.I've always been curious about Austrian cuisine, so my curiosity was finally answered. We tried the sausage sampler for two, and our other friend had the berner wurstel. The sausage sampler was so great but    unhealthy.  Although it was very delicious, I'm not used to eating that much meat at one meal and felt somewhat guilty. My friend loved the berner wurstel. The cucumber potato salad was really yummy. Next time, I'll try a vegetarian entree to offset the gluttony.I tried one of the fruity beers in their tallest glass. It was the perfect beverage to drink with a heavy entree. Please patronize this restaurant. It truly is a gem in the city. Love this place! Great food, great service!I've came here twice. Once for brunch and once for dinner. It's tough to get a spot for dinner since they don't take reservations but it is worth the wait. The food is amazing. For brunch I had ratatouille with hummus per the waiter's recommendation and thank you thank you for recommending this. I didn't think it would be enough but it was the perfect portion. It was the perfect combination of sweet and salty with smooth hummus and crunch bread and I just have to say the presentation was beautiful. Waiter was super friendly as well!For dinner, I had the wiener schnitzel and what can I say? Huge slab of fried chicken? Just yas all around.If this place was a little more convenient to get to, I'd be here all the time. Definitely recommend! Awesome German style grub, bratwurst, sausage, and pork belly plate for two was spot on with the pork belly super crispy on the top and tender meat on the bottom.  Sides of garlic chard and pickled plates were standouts, right balance of acid and seasoning.  The dumplings were super fluffy, light, fork tender.  Only wish the staff wasn't as rushed, 3 waiters/bartenders on a Friday evening wasn't enough. They were friendly but a little hard to get a hold of at times. This place has it all! Meat, potatoes, beer, sauerkraut and more meat! Yum!! This place has very high ratings for the amount of reviews it has and I can see why. Not only was their food spot on delicious, but the service was stupendous!I came here with some friends on a busy Saturday night and although there was a wait, the hostess was so attentive in keeping us up to date on the wait of our table as well as ensuring we had drinks on hand while waiting. When we were seated, the waitress along with the manager checked up on us at a well-paced regular basis to ensure we were having a good time. It was very appreciative. As for the food, we started off with their aufschnitt teller, a charcuterie dish essentially with pate and other spreads. Very appetizing. We then got the Sausage platter for two which comfortably fed three people. Thick, delicious, succulent sausages (two different kinds), fatty, moist pork belly with a slightly crusted skin, fresh sauerkraut and creamy, thick dumplings all on one plate. So good and so filling. We also shared their special of the night which was pork shoulder with butternut squash and potatoes with an apple slaw on top. Just as delicious. Potatoes were cooked perfectly. The pork was fall of the bone, super tender. Butternut squash was roasted to perfection. Great place for drinks and food. The restaurant is cute and cozy with a great bar in the middle. Great for a date or a group of friends just wanting to chill and eat some good food. So legit and so delicious! We came here for dinner after hanging out in a cat caf. I was starving and someone we met in the cat caf recommended Caf Katja for good Austrian food. I agree! The food was so good and the service was amazing! And the ambience is charming (candlelit tables and pine/fir lining the bar) for groups or dates.Food.We ordered the sausage sampler. I wanted to try everything! The sausage sampler has 3 types of sausage and crispy pork belly. If you want more options like me, its better to get a big group and order from the wurst section. I loved the savory garlicky bratwurst, and the crispy fatty pork belly. The emmentaler sausage was a sausage stuffed with cheese. The sauerkraut tasted homemade (and actually fermented instead of using mayo) and had bacon bits inside. So good! I'll have to come back to try the blood sausage. I love blood sausage usually.Service:Our waitress was so cheerful and happy. She was great and explained all the sausages to us after we ordered. She was so chipper! Thank you so much! Ambience:Loved loved loved the real candles on each table, but it was bright enough to see your food and your companion. Loved the simple wood tables. There was a random cute golden good luck Chinese cat on the mantle. We had a great time! Came here last year while looking for a good restaurant to eat in. Upon reading the Yelp reviews and looking through the photos, what hit me was the Reuben sandwich.My coworkers decided to celebrate with me here for my last day of work. We ordered a Reuben sandwich and bratwurst sausage with some cheese dumplings. Overall the the was good. I'll say the Reuben sandwich was the most memorable. The sausages were good too but the cheese dumplings were too bland and didn't really like it. I like the interior, very romantic and great for a first date. When we got there, the noise level was perfect and not too crowded. I also forgot to mention that the pretzel appetizer was good as well. What a good surprise!The place is very cozy, ""Austrian-German"" decorated and clean.Food is very good and good price for the value!We had creamy spinachs with poached eggs (suuuper soft and tasty) and a wurst, which was delicious. Lemonade ok.As dessert we tried the strudel... that was pretty average (it has grapes as well and we did not like it...)35$ check. Isn't that a good price?Will definitely go back Mmmmmm. Good German food in a casual but nice environment. The buttered spatula and the potato salad are standouts. Plus, you get a pot of mustard, and who doesn't want that? Delicious. First time here and have only had the bratwurst and sauerkraut but it was really good.I had a coupe of beers and they were very good too. I've been willing to come here for a while, and this evening I finally did. The place is very cute and welcoming. I got the Reuben, while my wife tried the duck breast. The Reuben was colossal! It can easily feed two people. I was a little turned off by the very small quantity of meat (usually Reuben sandwiches are loaded with pastrami), but the melted cheese was tasty. Unfortunately, the duck breast was so overcooked we had to send it back. They were beyond nice about it, though, especially the gentleman working on the floor. He was very apologetic, and despite our temporary disappointment, he made a huge effort to make us feel comfortable and well taken care. Because of the outstanding service, I would totally go back and try other dishes. Came here for brunch a few times and was always able to find seats. The food is delicious here and they have a great selection of beer! Holy crap this place was GOOD. the portions are HUGE and you will not leave hungry. I met an old friend here at his suggestion and it was fantastic. We split the cabbage salad, which was nice and refreshing, and a platter. The platter had frankfurters (eh), sausage (drooooool) and mofuckin pork belly. Oh and all this came with sauerkraut... cooked with bacon. I almost grew a curly tail.  AND... there were these fantastic little dumplings. The mustard this paired with was a nice spicy contrast to all the fattiness and juiciness.  A little pricey, and it was surprisingly empty when we got in around 6 on a Thursday. Would definitely recommend and return in Manhattan. I found my now favorite beer thanks to this restaurant. This is our go-to for the area and it has consistently been good. The expansion makes the place even better, although I did enjoy its coziness when it was still small. If you're in the mood for Austrian/German food in NYC; you've got to check out Cafe Katja. You'll definitely won't regret it. From my first visit to my third; they have always been consistent. Great atmosphere, great hospitality, service, and lastly great food. Four main components Cafe Katja provides. When it comes to food, everthing on the menu is worth trying; you won't be disappointed.I would definitely recommend their buttered spatzle; a must side and as well as any house made saussage; don't forget the pretzel as well :)Don't just believe what you're reading, go experience it yourself is my say. This place has been on my radar for a while, and after attending a fun event in Lower East Side, we decided to head over for dinner. They had their large windows facing the street open, which made it feel like the dining area was extended into the outside, making the large space even more spacious. The inside was quite large, bigger than it looks from the outside. There is a main dining area when you walk in, with a nice size bar taking up half (or more than half) the room. But, the dining area extends to the left, with booth seating and larger table seating that can accommodate larger groups of people. We started off with a beer, and of course, right after the first sip, we had to have their warm pretzel...! Well, it was more like steaming hot pretzel, it was great! As for the main dish, we wanted to try their Assorted Sausage Sampler which I heard great things about. It comes with several kinds of sausages, pork belly, sauerkraut, and dumplings. Most of everything is home-made right there at the restaurant, including sauerkraut and dumplings. The sausages were huge, plump, super juicy and packed with flavor.The service was very friendly, our server was super nice, she took a good care of us. She made us feel welcomed with a warm smile, made sure we had everything we needed.  I would love to go back for more great food, maybe a brunch on a weekend...

https://www.yelp.com//biz/caracas-arepa-bar-new-york,caracas-arepa-bar-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Venezuelan,Bars,NA,"This spot is STRAIGHT FIIIIRRRREEEE! You aint gonna find none of those fluffly yellow street fair arepas up in here! The food is magnificent. Oh and the SAWCE!!! Need that secret recipe bottled up like yesterday. The service is lightning quick. The experience is amazing. The wife and I spent our 6 month married anniversary lunch here. Delicious. Then grabbed a few brews up the block at McSorleys afterwards. It was money. From the religious themes to the food, to the spanish writing on the wall, this cozy joint is As authentic as it gets. Arepas run about $10 a pop. They got beers on deck too. Go get you some arepas ASAP This place is great for a quick sit down meal. It is very affordable and the employees are very welcoming. The only downside is the size of it. It is very small so if it is crowded there is no where to wait but outside. The food is very good and they have a good amount of options. Everything is cooked to order and delicious. They have a good selection of beverages and the soups are amazing. I would definitely go again. I would not go to this place with more than 4 people due to the size. Value: 5/10Experience: 7/10Taste: 6/10Cute tiny sit down with slightly smaller portion sizes than expected.Value: I got their classic arepa (forgot the name but it was like the 3rd one) for $13 after tip and tax. The arepa really was quite small for the price I paid.Experience: The interior had a friendly atmosphere and food came in about 10-15 minutes. They also had a bathroom with a small gap in the window making it kind of cold. The inside is definitely a bit cramped and we had to pull out the table for my friends to sit on the other side of the table.Taste: The arepa smelled delicious but the taste just didn't match that. The meat and filling were a bit bland and we needed the hot sauce to spice it up. I think there may have been too much potato or something starchy and drowned out the flavor. This arepas restaurant is literally one of those hole-in-the-wall places that people try to seek out. This restaurant can hold no more than 20 people probably, maybe even less. You walk in and the tables are directly in front of you and then there's a small kitchen in the area behind. It's a small business feel and someone approached us immediately and sat us down. We ordered two of the most popular arepas on the menu and started off with around of plantain chips as an appetizer. They do sell alcohol here but we skipped it for this mail so I can't speak to that. I absolutely love plantain chips and a bunch of different kinds came in a basket as our appetizer. I completely devoured our basket, it was so delicious!!! I would go back here just for those to be honest. Our arepas we're pretty large, and filled with plenty of meat. Mine was made with a beef and some sweet plantain, the combo was pretty unique but really delicious. My husband ordered one of the spicier options, but it wasn't an overbearing spice. We thoroughly enjoyed our food here and the serving size were perfect, especially when you down a hole plantain appetizer!If you're looking for some arepas this is a great spot to check out! More of a 3.5 for me. They hand make the arepa buns here! So good and so fresh. My go to arepa Sammie to order is the La Surena! It's chicken, pork sausage, avocado with their classic chimichurri sauce. Sooooo good and juicy and tender deliciousness! It is very messy to eat, but you'll eat every bite, licking your fingers. The sad thing I learned was their main restaurant closed down and they changed their carry out side to be their only Manhattan location, so it was very crowded and hectic to sit down to eat. The service also has gone down prob due to the crazy crowdedness. No warm and friendly service here, but the food is good, so I would still go back when the weather is warmer and I can eat it outside without having to wait for a table etc. This is the traditional Christmas dish from my Venezuela . Chicken salad, Hallaca (is like a tamal filling with pork, beef, olives, amazing excellent and ham bread. For my country this is a sad moment for all the political, economics and injustices that are happening there for the dictatorship. Please pray for us  and enjoy our food. @manudominguezm I'd had Caracas bookmarked for years, but it turned out to be overrated, overpriced, and underwhelming. I ordered the Yo-yo appetizer, which should actually be under the dessert category, the Hot Queen (made of pulled chicken, peppers, onions, mayo, avocado), and the Da Pabellon (shredded beef, beans, cheese, plantains). The arepas were small and ALRIGHT. The former was overtaken by the avocado, and the latter was pretty salty. One is not enough per person, and these arepas are not cheap. ~$10 for each one, which are the size of my fist, is kinda unacceptable.Place is abnormally small, so you may have a wait. For a party of two, we waited fifteen minutes outside and ended up sitting at the bar. Unique atmosphere, tender meat, tasty &amp; plentiful sauce( bottle on table). The pulled pork sandwich was full of tender meat. Although the tomato was mealy &amp; the Masa dough was a bit under done, it was still tasty. The beef sandwich with black beans and plantains,also loaded with ingredients! Again the sauce set it off. Expensive for what it was ,slow to receive the food combined with the dry personality of the staff knocked stars off. The Quick: Tiny location but big arepa (fried Venezuelan sandwiches) bursting with flavor. Love!The Details: not much can be said about this amazing arepa place without my stomach growling... The food is incredible. The East Village location is extremely small, so if you're looking to go with a group try their Brooklyn location that is large, bright, and trendy (so Brooklyn!) You can't go wrong. All the options are delicious, even the brunch arepas are exotic and savory.Pro Tip: if there is a wait, put your name down and split a lobster roll at Luke's lobster next-door. That's right, I sometimes pregame dinnerThe Damage: extremely reasonable! Each arepa is around nine dollars and they are extremely filling. If possible, I suggest splitting three between two people although it's messy. Or split an appetizer Never a dull meal at Caracas.  Attentive staff.  Quality Arepas with a healthy variety of fillings.  You might com hungry and try to order two, but trust me, that's a food coma waiting to happen.  La Suena is my favorite.  Go for the special sauce on the table it's perfect.  And for fun wash it down with a cocada on a warm day.  Love it there. The fundamentals are here but does not sing in harmony.  Skip the appetizers as they were mediocre.  The arepas were made well and freshly toasted.  The fillings by themselves were good but seem to lack cohesion as a sandwich filling.  Maybe a sauce would be the bond that ties it together.Passion fruit juice was nice.  Very small and limited seating.  Take out might be a good route. One of my favorite. This place is the first place I take out of town guests to taste NYC. It's best to go at lunch because you can get the lunch combo (arepa plus salad or soup). The restaurant is tiny. Expect a wait, expect to be sitting on a crate and to be sitting in someone else's ""bubble"". It's very very very tasty food. The chimichurri sauce (available for sale) is out of this world -- nectar of the gods! They won't tell you wants in it but if you have a good allergy I'm sure they will tell you to avoid it if it's going to be a problem. La Surenya with Chicken, Chorizo, Avocado is my favorite. I went with my Venezuelan friend, and she said they were good arepas. We both got the vegetarian arepa one... forgot the name... with fried plaintains, avocado, and some sort of white cheese. I really really liked it. The white cheese reminded me of mozzarella. It could be bland for some people, so feel free to use the sauce that they provide on the table. It came out quickly and tasted fresh.We also ordered the tequenos. She also said they were good, and they gave a good amount. They tasted like pillsbury dough boy breading with white cheese in it. It was tasty. I just don't know if it all should be $9.00-$9.50. It was more like $7.00-worth it, but again, this is New York. Place was small and cramped. Not good for big groups or to go when it's crowded. I recommend just taking it to go. Obsessed with this place! They make the best arepas!! The inside of this location is very small and is very busy, but worth the wait! The De Pabellon is my favorite arepa although any of them are great! Also love the fried plantains with salty cheese appetizer and the chips &amp; guac! Caracas arepas are reasonably priced and taste delicious every single time! Don't miss out on this place! Why, Caracas, why? I've been going to Caracas arepa bar in east village for 10 years on and off and I thought the original location was tight. Since there was the fire, they've converted the former ""to go"" location into a dine in restaurant. Now imagine the teeniest little stools and tables imaginable. They've crammed as many tables as physically possible, which I appreciate, but cannot help but feel claustrophobic as soon as I set foot inside. That being said, I love me some Caracas arepas. Arepas are Venezuelan sandwiches made with corn flour stuffed with goodies. La surena or die, I am a girl who likes what she likes and always orders the same thing. It has chicken, chorizo and avocado, with the house sauce it is to. Die. For. I could drink that sauce its a little sweet and adds a kick, I would probably put it in my eggs in the morning if I wasn't too lazy to bring it home. Yes, you can buy a bottle for yourself - you're welcome. Please, arepa gods, let me love you and open a bigger location asap! I haven't had an arepa since my visit to Puerto Rico, so I was excited to try this place out. Inside is pretty small, not too much seating, so I wouldn't suggest it for a larger party size. Most arepas are around $10. I ordered the playa deluxe, which comes with tilapia, onions, mushroom, and avocado. All these ingredients are stuffed into a freshly made Arepa bun. It's tasty, flavorful, and enough to fill me up. This was stop number one out of seven on a food adventure night with my friends, and two of my friends said this was their favorite spot that night. We visited here a long time ago and recently ordered again for delivery. The first time we went we were really full (trying to get a good taste of NYC before a flight) so I chalked up the sorta average experience to that.But then we had it again when we were really hungry... and basically, it is what it is. It's heavy and it's messy but it'll get the job done if you're in the mood. If your trust fund spots your east village apartment and you have a pink whale stickered on your lap top this will probably be your favorite restaurant. You might also enjoy if you shop at brooks brothers or lululemon. Hands down the best Venezuelan food in NYC. I came here on Friday night around 8:30pm and waited 20 minutes to be seated. The place was really small literally a hole in a wall. The service was amazing despite the fact that it was only one waiter who served all the tables and took care of the seatings. What we ordered: - Guacamole and chips: The guac was okay, super pureed and had more of a sour lime flavor to it if you enjoy that. It comes with a variety of chips (sweet potato, plantains, etc). The ratio was off they give you a lot more chips than guac. - Hot Queen: The arepas come piping hot. It's starchy and so delicious. The pulled chicken was great but it had a really strong cilantro taste which I'm not a fan of. I would reccomend it to anyone who loves cilantro hahaha. - Playa Deluxe: Excellent!! I'm so glad I went with this. The tilapia was fresh, plenty, not fishy and went so well with the mushrooms, onions and the crazy flavorful homemade herb mayo. The spicy sauce they provide on the table also went really well with it. - Sangria: I'd pass on this. It was $16 for 4 small glasses. Quite expensive and not that great. It was a quick satisfying meal. My only complaint is that the chairs were so uncomfortable. My friend and I couldn't sit longer for 10 mins. The bill was about $60 including tax and tip which is expensive. I would probably return or possibly order for take-out next time.",https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/q32mPKv-WrIiavzLeD4SJg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9HKydiGdmVFcmcMWx1AjXg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tiYzFORvGgiMj3eVpQWGzg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/51nLSp2fzVaeFSyLB7d3Kg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dQoTnjKYcTrnRWSTsc2VYA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/spPHZCY1uelvvXOST5dmxg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4lzFEIR9ChVz0iX7oHYbRw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1Xlv-C-2QkeH4L4lZLyShQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YoE4wxVUoHLoO_296fxP_w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/U1yJJ67X5DeOw37QprphTw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-V3b8esKJocPcCKN3kFEmg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WGP7srAtVyYh_9Xc_BhWMQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LVP6HJNEu-FnAmFgJkJ1yw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dEIFv18-JKzC5oNpQ1OAyQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/D7UI6hL-v4DtGXq4z5XtgA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/k-1oxVkgkB2w-CIPmANO7g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4lR8CJpJ4D6w0b0g3YbHAQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/idNTyNz_U-llAFS8aIMWFw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CtRIAjGX_S8xqiQgJGdV_A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uDMpsItUGvzkjv5TH7A5ow/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pCM6CRBg5w5SPONivJrisA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0ZIG7Vxs3UH5JIYhXJfGnA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IBii5Kq_MRt2jFQ_NUi5yw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZOQLHE2u4AU9p_oQoXrk6A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/J3hC833XK-rRRrmv6gA_2Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/e0IocDV-az3sPOirt5fNBQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/H-l9iks0JhqkUxFyHbojpg/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA

Get the creme brulee. good place - good coffee, nice selection of baked sweets and chocolate if you like that, truffles are actually really good.It's also quiet and sometimes deserted. These croissants = CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH.Maybe my expectations were too high going in after reading the Serious Eats article, but I was a little disheartened after trying the croissants here. I came in around 9 am on a weekday and got a plain croissant ($2.95) and an almond croissant ($3.75).1. They feel very greasy, even for croissants.2. The shell is very crispy and crunchy and shatter-y and hard, too much so - biting through it reminded me of childhood breakfasts eating corn flakes (though the shards here are much thinner).The plain croissant has a nice butter flavor but it's so so greasy, and I feel greasy after eating it. A little disappointed at the inside as the one I got had a massive hollow and the layers clumped together.2/5The almond croissant was very crunchy and shatter-y too, and most of its faults of this are also faults of the plain croissant. The outside tasted slightly burned, and even the next day after being stored in a bag it was super hard and crunchy instead of getting soggier from the moisture in the almond paste... I love the almond pieces in the frangipane though - it adds an amazing texture! One end didn't have any frangipane :( I haven't found my perfect almond croissant yet, but I think I've found my perfect almond filling.3/5 - +1 from the plain croissant for the frangipane I don't like to poopoo local businesses, but having had several bad experiences with their products I cannot help but feel obliged to review. My office bought a tart from here to celebrate a coworker's birthday and my slice had a large bug inside. I'm not sure what it was but it was a whole bug and about the size of a fingernail. Yuck.I gave them the benefit of the doubt - bugs are attracted to sweet things. This could happen to anyone. I purchase a croissant every morning from a local coffee shop who get their baked goods from Ceci-Cela (I saw the order invoice once). While a little unnerved to see this I continued to purchase my morning croissant. Once, there was a small fly cooked into the glaze. I picked it out and ate my croissant - it was that or starve until lunch time. Today, the final straw, my croissant had a black grit residue throughout the pastry. I have no idea what this substance was, but it was disgusting and definitely not supposed to be there. Sadly I will need to source my breakfast elsewhere, but I will certainly be steering clear of Ceci Cela. I think they may have some production issues that I'm no longer prepared to endure. Overall excellent experience. We had a cup of English breakfast tea that was fine but not great and even if you were sitting in they gave it to you in a paper cup. The pastries though we're all excellent. We got an almond croissant, a chocolate croissant a cherry cheese danish and mini apricot danish. The cherry cheese danish did have a pit in one of the cherries which was disappointing. It was great that they had the mini option in case you didn't want a full pastry. The croissants we're definitely the hit of the trip. Both the chocolate and the almond were in top ten category of croissants I've had. Service was quick and pleasant. There is a decent amount of seating it you do want to stay and sit but there's only one big table so be weary if you have a large group. If yelp did half stars I would have honestly given this place a 4 1/2 Had Ceci-Cela's fruit tart at a friend's birthday gathering. I was thoroughly impressed by the quality and freshness and can't wait to return to try out more of their pastries.A friend brought over a raspberry and blueberry fruit tart (I didn't buy it, so can't say much about the price) and it was absolutely divine! The fruits were so fresh, and coated in a sugary syrup that only enhanced their flavor. There was a custard in between the base and the fruit that was creamy but not too sweet. The crust was flaky and tied the whole pastry together perfectly. Overall, a delicious alternative to a more traditional cake! Definitely planning on coming here in the future. Ahhhh, at last. I've found the mecca for croissants and delicious French pastries in NYC. After being clued in to this place by 12 Corners (and apparently ignoring this storefront the 50 times I've walked past this block), I finally visited for a morning drink and nibble.The teas are from Harney &amp; Sons, which are always lovely. The Paris blend smells and taste pretty damn heavenly. The pistachio Madeleine is plump and beyond moist. I curse myself for sloughing it with the Starbucks packaged ones lately. And finally, the chocolate croissant. The perfect balance of chewy and flaky, that doesn't deflate once you've taken a bite, even after the server warmed it up in the toaster oven for me for a hot minute. (Lol, hot minute.) And it has the right amount of chocolate to round out the scrumptious flavor of the whole pastry. This is it man. This is the one that I've been searching for, and it's thankfully downtown and near my home. Maybe some will argue there are better ones uptown/elsewhere, but idgaf. I'm good and satisfied with this one.Of course I wish it was as affordable as it is in Europe, currency calculations aside. But the space is lovely and the staff cheerful and accommodating.It has gotten a tad crowded and hectic post-10am on a Saturday morning. And I haven't tried the sandwiches and such, so I can't in good faith dole out the coveted 5 stars.But, the early morning hours right after opening is when you want to be here to get that little respite from the NYC grind and a touch of Parisian joie d'vivre. Stopped by on a snowy Saturday for some respite from the wind and cold. My friend and I shared an almond croissant and chocolate raspberry cake. Both were delicious (I love almond croissants so much). She also had a chai tea latte, which she enjoyed.Service was super friendly and we didn't feel pressured by the staff to leave at all, despite a growing crowd.Definitely want to come back for more croissants and to try the giant macaron cake! Craving a pastry on Sunday morning, we stopped by Ceci Cela based on the strong reviews. Sadly, it did not live up to the hype.At 11:30 am, they were already sold out of every type of croissant. Which happens, and there were ample pastry options still available.  We selected a blueberry danish and a sugarbread. Both pastries were incredibly dry. The blueberry danish kept losing berries because there wasn't enough pastry cream or fruit juice to hokd it together. My husband - who has never been known to leave even crumbs behind - could not finish his pastry.Worse yet, the service added insult to injury. I started by saying I was craving a croissant, did they have any? There were none in the case, but sometimes places have extra they haven't put out yet. The server bluntly said no. We then asked for some recommendations, which led us to the blueberry danish. When she pulled it out (with her bare hand!), She dropped blueberries on the counter. She did not apologize, but did quip, ""more for me."" Not even a thank you or a have a nice day when we left. Basic common courtesies are not too much to ask for, folks.Beautiful pastries, but dryness and poor service will keep us from trying this spot again in the future. Ceci-Cela serves up some amazing croissants. Although the croissant pastry seems like a simple French staple, it takes a long time to make--you have to freeze and re-freeze the dough, and that takes hours. At first bite, the taste and texture may seem like nothing much, but after a few more bites, the true essence of the croissant seems to come out: the oddly familiar, yet warm buttery taste embedded in the flaky layers, enriching the surface of the tongue with each mouthful. It's soo amazing. I've never had a croissant like that before. As for other items, I've also tried a Pistachio Madeline, but felt that it could be better. The texture was a bit stale and the ""Pistachio"" flavor was too sweet and sour(tangy?). And, oh, I almost forgot to mention this, but the cashier at the register is sort of cute. ;)) I had the most lovely time talking to the staff here. I wandered in on a lazy afternoon, looking for some type of pastry. The lady behind the counter recommended the classic croissant (less than $3, forgot the exact price) and explained to me that they have the best ones in the city! Upon checking the back, the lady came back and told me that there actually weren't any left, but recommended a few other items on display. Often times when bakeries run out of my first choice, I usually just leave, but the staff here was too friendly and helpful. They were just EXCITED to be working and seeing me as if it made a difference that I was there at all. I ended up buying one of the turnovers, and left the store feeling great! Long story short, I didn't actually end up eating the pastry since I just wasn't feeling hungry. I ended up passing by a homeless man on Broadway with a sign that had the word ""embarrassed"" plastered quite largely on it. I felt compelled to reach out and give him something, so I decided to pass along the pastry I bought so I really hoped it was a treat! Technically, my rating isn't about the food, but it's about the establishment itself. Nothing like going to a bakery that can uplift your mood and inspire you to pass on the good feels to a complete stranger. Next time, I'll definitely come by early and sit down to enjoy a lovely croissant! Come support a business that really does care about your experience! Update: still one of the best croissants in the city. I've come to the conclusion that the almond surpasses both the plain and chocolate-almond. we recently purchased the frozen croissants that are made my laurent dupal. they are easy to prepare and provide a very french, delicious, unusual breakfast for guests (or for your own private indulgence)run don't walk to get them if you can. Delicious croissants!Cute bakery with seating towards the back. Upon entering, you will notice it's a bit narrow in here with loads of delicious baked goods displayed on your left. Employees are friendly, quick, and wrapped up our goodies neatly. Picked up some croissants for my mom and aunt, who love them. They are delicious, with the consistency and taste on point. I enjoy their pastries but wouldn't say this is my ultimate favorite place for them in NY. I stick to the croissants here. Cute cozy spot to grab some good pastries and coffee! Stopped in here after lunch and I wasn't disappointed! They had an array of croissants, macaroons, and cakes! I got the Creme brle which was 5.50 and honestly SOOO worth it! definitely coming back! I've walked by this pastry shop over a dozen times but never thought much of it, until I was craving a croissant this morning and saw the raving reviews on Yelp! Walked in and loved alll the delicious cakes and pastries in their display windows mmm! Got a chocolate croissant to go - delicious, buttery, soft and flakey! Can't wait to come back and try more. The shop was relatively empty with open tables and free wifi - will definitely add this to my list of work/study spots, though dangerous to be so close to so many sugary &amp; buttery delights! Definitely some of the best croissants in the city, now available in a much bigger spot.The original one on Spring Street was practically just a tiny hallway, so this new one with tables and more seating is a welcome change.The plain and almond croissants are amazing, so definitely make sure you stop by here to try either one or both. As an added bonus, they're giving out mini ones on this opening weekend, so get there now for a free taste. I was disappointed that their croissants aren't as good as they were when they were back closer to Broadway. Guess time changes and so do people and perhaps consistency. May be I went on a bad day or I just got the bad batch. Very good pastries, liked the raisin danish on my first visit.  There was also an almond croissant that looked great.  They even had a brioche w/ orange cream filling which is pretty cool.  The space was nice, but with very narrow counters to eat inside &amp; just a couple outdoor tables.  Other small downside, most of the pastries are 4 bucks a pop, which is expensive.  But the staff was friendly and with a quality product, it is very much worth trying out or visiting on occasion if you're local.  Certainly not a daily spot unless you have a fat  wallet So over two years later I finally came back for more than just a chocolate mousse. I tried their turkey sandwich which was tasty, except the bread was a little chewy (rubbery, almost). Also came out pretty fast which leaves me wondering how long they stay refrigerated until somebody orders one...I kept my promise of trying their macaroons though. Sweet is definitely an understatement, like literally biting into sugar. I much preferred the fraisiers... They had one with raspberries which was great.I'll definitely be back but maybe just to stick with my traditional chocolate mousse.",https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/N_YrbfJ7nJJNoroM64wmSA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Tml7QaWvR-s-CbAgGJUqQg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0btS4mMD0HWWZW2L3Zju9w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/t9mWNmaK7vSOzERA8g-S-Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YnV2iUoVbAJXBL8Q_kQMdg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3XDa4f2CWWBWGR8fjruFWA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Pm3yc0cBvJbqR8bzYbJtow/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kt8ChcHhyVKnZnsYuoyIhQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2iIXis60Mw8zDWmF6uHmzQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oS6aXgJ326zQ4XrZ4OH3kg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/V36SrdDxGjC5cCM_aL_QvQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fy4cVP9K52dqoR4fgRvBpQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GioERWiG6jsmHvFElYZygw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Sl_KAnGEcv9SPMXjmrmuPg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zZXDwPSBP7fhtEQv9rKTkg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gzz4027059LjMzGZG931ng/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VZNcxrA-a0D2M8wYjtXiRw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qhDORSfT5cHykzmwNHoBXw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2B9wpzDOhKcOITdR7q6LnQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/j1FLMJz-VVTHwAd2mleuUg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Q0Z24C4mP4Rqis4NvOMA5A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/F48YnB_ZK7rdP3hGNOzJRQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UV9L_DAgiGiwmQgsioshtg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/t9LzwRXuOpOhPlKRVk0k9w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/U6gMRfMmOIuOz83ph_JGrA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MVPWuzYCI6xEir7EWaFl6Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6aFnjHAGhsIF8JcD6G74hg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IRFV_iY-HI9ijXcJbjrzvw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BHcTIbKRr-Mwdp5KgPz4mg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TZQgVx87-NG9skKfOH5MZg/258s.jpg
https://www.yelp.com//biz/char-sue-new-york,char-sue-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Asian Fusion,Pan Asian,Beer Bar,"Char Sue is a great casual asian spot with a cool vibe and a short list of delicious drinks. When we arrived, the staff quickly showed us to a table on a Friday night even though it was shortly after 7 and we had expected to wait. It turns out we arrived just in time, as within 20 minutes, the restaurant was full and there was a wait. There is a Happy Hour menu with a half-dozen deals on small plates (tacos, pork ribs, etc.) as well as drink specials. Happy Hour occurs from 5pm - 8pm. We each ordered drinks that were priced very reasonably as we were just within this timeframe. For food, we ordered the green papaya salad, Mapo pork belly, five spice duck wings, and crispy brussels sprouts. The standout was definitely the brussels sprouts, which we could have easily eaten two orders of, and the wings. The papaya salad was fresh, but could've used more dressing, and the pork belly was a little rich for my tastes. Overall, can't wait to go back as portions and prices are definitely reasonable and they have a good selection of sake that I would like to explore some more. Highly recommend. Good Asian fusion spot if you're into non-traditional Asian food with a flare. We started with happy hr appetizers that start at $6, pork belly taco came with a crunchy shell and tangy green sauce. The duck wings were a bit too glazed and fried. Same for brussel sprouts, which came out too charred but were well flavored.For the main dish, we had the duck with rice, which was garnished with pickled radish and peppers (wish they had more of the garnish to balance the fat from the duck). Our pieces were too fatty but the skin was very crisp and well flavored.Finally, the highlight was the vanilla cappuccino, which has dashes of the Vietnamese coffee and fluffy whipped cream. Char Sue on a Sunday @ 5:40pm as a first time patron... I wasn't sure what to expect. However, I do know this establishment has been bookmarked for some time. Before I was willing to commit I asked to see a menu, based on what I saw (majority pork, which I don't eat) I'm not clear on why I even bookmarked this place but I was already there and heck I must've saved it for a reason. So my bestie and I decided to give it a whirl. Boy oh boy... were we glad we did!Bonnie was amazing from when first walked in and wasn't ready to ""yes to the plate"" just yet. At first we were the only table and there were some gentlemen seated at the bar. She clearly explained everything to us and gave us the time to figure things out. We decided on the sharing plates and vegetables. They were Shrimp Summer Roll, Monkey Bread, Five Spice Duck Wings, Crispy Brussels Sprouts (OMG never have I ever experienced Brussels Sprouts this dang GOOD), Broccolini and Nigori to drink.Shrimp Summer Roll: avocado, chinesse celery, cilantro, carrot, ume vinaigrette ($10)- very tasty light and refreshing with an amazing vinaigrette that isn't too over powering. Monkey Bread: freshly ground thai green curry, roasted sweet potato ($12)- the sweet potato under the bread is a nice touch to prevent premature sogginess. However, the highlight of this dish is the thai green curry sauce/broth. You will literally be licking the bowl. Five Spice Duck Wings: plum sugar glaze, cucumbers, scallions, sesame (Happy Hour $6)- H/H is until 7:30 and this portion comes with 2 wings. Great flavor profile, sweet and salty but not over bearing. Crispy and saucy skin with very tender meat. Crispy Brussels Sprouts: nuoc cham, peanuts, chilies ($8)- FREAKING AMAZBALLS... So dang good we ordered it twice. I do not know what they did to this veggies but whatever it was, it was Amazing!Broccolini: charred, pumpkin seeds, soy ($8)- ok people, idk what they do to vegetables here but they do it very well. Another wonderful dish, with great flavor. SHO Chiku Bai, Junmai Nigori ($6)- explained as a cloudy form of sake ... Wasn't a fan only got it bc of my name.Clearly I had and enjoyable meal and look forward to returning. I will be ordering serval of the same things again like those Sprouts. Only complaint was that the menu consists of mostly pork and I actually do not partake. So that was initially part of my hesitation. 5 stars !Clean QuirkyAmazing serviceSharing platesSimple menuBraised duck Short ribsPapaya saladNot much to say because it was an amazing fare.Very simple and up to the point.Thank you The terms 'pan-Asian' or 'Asian fusion' typically arouse immediate suspicion, but those are words I would use to describe Char Sue and I really enjoyed everything I ate the other night! It's a very casual spot, with table service, a bar you can eat at, or a grab and go counter at the front. The first pleasant surprise was when we found out that we had made it in time for their happy hour, which goes til 8pm and offers lots of drinks and food items at $3-5 - a great deal! From that menu we got the pooty fries with the five spice short rib, which was my favorite dish of the meal. The short ribs were amazingly flavorful and tender, and next time I'm definitely going to get the full order of them over rice or noodles. The other dishes we had were also mighty tasty for the most part. We really liked the lamb in Japanese curry over rice, as well as the broccolini side dish. We weren't fans of the Japanese eggplant, simply because they were far too salty and a bit mushy. The ambiance is brightly lit and perhaps a tad too casual for a romantic date, but perfect for an easy meal with friends or on your own. Everything came out really quickly and was hot and fresh. Prices are pretty reasonable too, depending on what you get. I have to admit I'm curious about their full Peking duck dinner, which they say feeds 3-5 people and costs $150. A perfect location near the Essex stop, and lots of other bars to drop into for a drink before or after. This anti-pan-Asian may be a convert thanks to Char Sue! I've found a new favorite place.I love how no-frills this place is, yet the food is top notch. I can just casually walk into this place and have an amazing meal. That's a win-win in my book. Also, there's a counter for solo eating, in case you either have no friends or you have friends but you DON'T WANNA SHARE. Everyone's got that one food-stealing friend. (PS - If you can't think of one, it's probably you.)The roast duck with noodles is my newest obsession. Why is the duck so good?? The portion is just right, although I wouldn't mind just a teeny bit more noodles. The duck is juicy and tender and the skin is crispy, fatty, and flavorful. It's similar to roast Peking duck, but elevated somehow. Also, the daikon salad is a nice starter. Sweet, tart, salty, and refreshing at the same time. I'm eager to try the other items on the menu, although I'll probably order the duck a few more times before I move onto anything new. It's just that good.The service is pleasant enough, the place gets crowded unless you go early, and the happy hour wines suck. Go for the food and you leave happy. 'Nuff said. It's a quirky kind of decor but the tables are nicely spaced out. Service is pretty attentive and your water glass will be filled. The food is beyond delicious. The meats are cooked so well, tender and full of flavor. The curried lamb is just all kind of flavors bursting in your mouth. The star of the meal is the duck. Their take on the traditional roasted duck is done very well. The skin is crisp and there is a nice layer of fat and then the meat. It's tender and I would eat it every day. The Szechuan spice rub adds the new twist and it's not overwhelming at all. I love their take on something so comforting and executing it well. Char Sue was the bomb!!! It was worth walking from the village to this new comer in the LES. It is right across from the really cool covered market place and near Beauty and Essex. It is in a simple interior with no pretention that you enter this amazing eatery! You have a prep kitchen in the entrance, and a large bar towards the back of the place. We sat on high chairs and wanted to order everything from the menu! Small menu, which I like, the less you have, the better and fresher the food tends to be. There are traditional Asian restaurant appetizers such as green papaya salad, shrimp summer rolls, pork belly, wings... everything looked appetizing but we started off with a sandwich! There are 4 meats: 2 pork dishes, 1 duck, 1 lamb. They come in a bowl with rice or egg noodle or in a sandwich. We wanted to try all the main menu flavors, so we ordered 2 main dishes and 1 sandwich (and that's why we started off with a sandwich!)...We had one of the pork flavor on a sandwich and it was AMAZING. It reminded me of a bao meets banh mi. We loved it. The white fully cloud like bread was delicious. The meat was perfectly seasoned, the spices were on point! We chose our main dish to be the other pork dish (5 spices I believe) with rice and the duck with egg noodles. OMG. The flavors were unbelievable, like nothing I ever had before. It was perfect, just perfect. The pork was fantastic. It had so many layers, the juices and sauces are what dreams are made of. The duck was excellent. Crunchy of the outside, perfectly cooked on the inside. Beware of the little bones... Honestly, this place is a hidden gem and it should be on triple D for Guy Fieri to try. It's so tasty, so simple, and yet the depth of flavors is really to die for. I cannot wait to go back, and eat there again. The owner and chef has been trained by the best, and his talent, energy and creativity is clearly showing in the dishes presented. YUM! GO! I first stumbled into Char Sue several weeks prior, and had the chance to sample an array of their small plates and appetizers - which are ideal for any happy hour get together. I can still remember how flavorful and well-encased in an egg roll shell the Black Pepper Beef Tacos were and the seasoning and spice that were layered in the Five Spice Duck Wings... Needless to say, when the opportunity came to revisit Char Sue for a five course dinner menu, I immediately said yes.The restaurant is conveniently located just steps away from the Delancey-Essex stop in the LES, and is set up for diners and groups of all sizes. Looking to just grab a quick bite? Take a seat at the bar or one of the two tops to the side. Hoping to have a group of friends and family? There's a communal table that'll seat everyone at once as well. It works for almost any occasion, and the food alone is deserving of a special visit.Dinner began with a new menu addition: Monkey Bread served a top a slice of sweet potato in a Thai Green Curry. The bread is a family recipe, compliments of Chef Matty Rojas, and is soft and pillowy with no small amount of butter - perfect for getting that slight crisp at the bottom of the bed. It's the perfect vehicle for scooping up the spicy and creamy curry, and contrasts well with the sweetness of the sweet potato. The following dish isn't, unfortunately, on the permanent menu, but if I had my way - it would be. Tender, succulent slices of octopus were served with charred brussels sprouts and paired with a spicy pennywort vinaigrette. The flavors were reminiscent of the Yu Xiang (<U+9C7C><U+9999>) sauce that I've grown up eating, and was the perfect savory-spicy flavor for the protein.Next up: Crispy. Pork. Belly. No other words are really necessary, but I did my best to savor each of the three pieces that were served; they had a crisp, crunchy crust that yielded to a tender and fatty interior, and was highlighted even more with the side of a garlic-chili dipping sauce. It ties with the Char Sue Duck as my favorite dish of the night, but how can you compare to a plate of decadent dry-aged roast duck coated in a blend of Sichuan spices? A crisp, crackling skin, tender and juicy white meat, all served a top of bed of warm sushi rice... this would easily be my last meal (if I ever had to choose one) and is more than successful as a modern, elevated take on the traditional Peking duck.To finish, a sweet almond pudding with a strawberry jam provided the ideal light finish to the meal... and also cemented my desire to camp outside their kitchens for the remainder of my time. (You think I'm joking. I'm not.)I'm already planning a return visit to Char Sue, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a uniquely NYC restaurant. Here, Asian food is redone and reinvented to even better and more delicious forms, but still stay true to their core flavors and tastes - and truly, you won't find these dishes anywhere else. 3 stars because the food here was severely lacking some oomph. We tried the short ribs app ($9) and duck noodle entree ($17). The short ribs were cooked well, but not long enough because the meat didn't fall off the bone. They smothered some copycat teriyaki sauce on top of the ribs instead of marinating them which tasted really basic. The duck noodles were a hot mess. Duck breast had an interesting/okay flavor but was overlooked. The noodles/broth was way too sweet and the radish too salty. Overall one of the individual components of the dish complimented each other well. The chefs here really need to step up their game and pull together more thoughtful dishes.   In the other hand, ambiance was nice, and the interior is pretty cute. Our server and hostess were both really great. Such a pity that the food here is so underwhelming. Save your $$ and goto Chinatown for some cheap and yummy Chinese food. Walked passed here many times in LES and finally gave it a try tonight. I was pretty deceived by the name because i thought it would be Chinese BBQ pork. But their speciality lies in their ducks and five spice rub. Our waitress recommended the roast duck with noodles. We also ordered the spare ribs and brussel sprouts to share.The duck was very flavorful and The noodles were delicious but the duck to noodle ratio was off. Surprisingly there was more duck to noodle ratio! At best the food was okay but would not return again. I get rent is more expensive here than chinatown but for that money i rather go to big wong in chinatown for a fraction of the price I dropped into Char Sue for their first-ever beer pairing dinner with the good folks at Transmitter Brewing. Quite frankly, Transmitter was the name that caught my attention, as they are the brewery behind two of the best beers I have ever tried (FYI the W1 and G6). So, I grabbed a friend and grabbed two seats to this unique culinary event.The five-course menu was prepared ahead of time, and each course was better than the last. The highlights were a rainbow trout with cucumber coulis (Char Sue brings the sauce!), lamb merguez scotch egg with smoked (!) yogurt, and a sweet and savory ice cream bun. The beers were also great, and carefully chosen to pair with its respective dish. Beer winner on the night = G4 golden ale.Sadly, of the dishes we had, only one is currently on the regular menu: the pork belly taco, which is on the happy hour menu. While not a winner on the night, this was more because the other dishes were exemplary rather than a slight on the tacos. The tacos contained a great amount of heat and brightness thanks to a Thai chili salsa that will kick your ass.All in all, this was a uniquely pleasurable dining experience, and I hope they continue the practice on a regular basis. I will definitely be returning to Char Sue to see what other delicacies they have in store. I had this place bookmarked for a while and was excited to try it, only to be disappointed that it was not really Chinese BBQ. Don't get me wrong--the roast duck I had was really good, but the price, for me, was just too much at $17 and prevented me from giving 4 stars. The noodles that came with the plate were standard egg noodles and came in a sweet sauce. I liked that the dish came with a lot of duck, but I wish the duck and noodles were evenly proportioned because I didn't feel full afterwards. We also got the eggplant appetizer which was interesting. The eggplant was soft and came in a light sauce that was sour (think vinegar). I thought it was weird and much prefer eggplant in garlic sauce, especially since it was $7. Overall, not sure I'd come back because I'm never in the area and just a bit too pricey for me. Service and ambiance 5 stars, but food I would give is 3 stars. Definitely not your typical Chinese restaurant. Food here is definitely unique. The item on the menu that caught our attention was the beef tacos and after we finally got a chance to try it, I now understand why people rave about it. The taco shell was perfectly crispy, with well seasoned ground beef with hidden pieces of red hot peppers, topped with a generous amount of guac, and finished off with shredded cabbage to make it photo ready. Warning: it is super spicy but it's the kind of spiciness that makes you crave for more. Aside from that, we also got the Brussels sprouts, mapo pork belly, and the duck with noodles. Everything was good, but the duck with noodles was certainly not worth $17. A few pieces of duck, with 2 bites of noodles, and some random pieces of veggies on top that doesn't even make sense. I would like it more if the noodles actually have more flavor. Overall, cute date spot. Highly recommend you go try the beef tacos, you won't regret it. So. Freaking. Good. My boyfriend and I got the green papaya salad, duck wings, pork ramen, and braised pork with black bean sauce with rice. The papaya salad and pork ramen were good, but our favorites by far were the braised pork with rice and duck wings. The duck wing meat was falling off the bone and super flavorful. The braised pork tasted like the ultimate home cooking and almost reminded me of the Taiwanese pork and rice but better than any I've had here. The salty, savory flavors were on point and the added salad, pickled radish, scallions and garlic balanced the richness. We ended with the basil ice cream which was surprisingly refreshing.They ran out of the actual duck and ribs when we came, but after trying the pork, we will definitely be back to try those. As a skeptic of any cha siu place that isn't a hole in the wall, I was blown away by the deliciousness &amp; quality of the food here, in addition to the atmosphere, cleanliness and friendliness of the waiters. Crispy roast duck in the mantou sandwich was super flavorful, and I highly recommend it. I was expecting a small mantou with a little bit of duck for a pricey $8 but boy I was wrong! Huge mantou with a bit of that duck fat grease, and enough pieces of duck that you'd see on an entree. Prepare for this to be messy to eat, naturally. Just pick up the duck pieces that fall out with your fork and add some of their heavenly chili sauce to it. The five spice short rib plate with egg noodles was surprisingly tasty as well. Short rib is fall off the bone, except they make it even easier and take out the bones already, topped with a bunch of garlicky, saucy garnishes including braised daikon. It was super delicious. My only feedback is that the egg noodles were a tad soggy and a tiny bit bland (though that might have been bc I didn't mix some parts of it well, as everything else was bursting with flavor), but this was entirely made up for when sprinkling some of their garlic chili flakes and oil. Admittedly an entire mantou sandwich and egg noodles plate was too much for one person, but I'm glad I tried both and was pleasantly surprised at the big portion sizes! I'll be back again for that crispy roast duck. Located directly across the street from Essex Market, this seems out of place from the rest of the area. I absolutely loved the interior. It has a very chill/laid back vibe that's great for catching up with a friend or a low pressure place to bring a date. We came in around 6pm on a week night and it was pretty quiet with just 1 other table. Prices are a bit higher for the type of food, but the portions are decent. It's about $8 for a bun, but they are bigger than what you would get elsewhere. Didn't try the entrees so I can't speak for those. We got the roast duck and 5 spice short ribs. The duck was so carefully crafted with just enough crispy skin mixed in and the short ribs were so tender, they just fell apart. Overall, the mantous were great and delicious. Cocktails were $10 a glass so of course we had to try them out. The two we got were very colorful and perfect for summer. Light, citrusy and clean on your palate. Something between a 4 and a 5. If the prices were slightly lower, I'd probably increase the rating a bit but not by that much (as well it couldn't go over a 5.)Instead of getting noodles I stuck with two mantou sandwiches, the braised short rib as well as the pulled duck with black bean. The bread was super fluffy and it held the sauce well.Of the two I preferred the braised short rib though both were excellent. I just found it less conventional for the price. Both were good and a bit messy. I found the duck with a bit of spice to actually have a good amount of sour heart.I tried a bit of their homemade hot oil. It was different but quite good good. A bit earthy in flavor compared to others.They have a very good beer selection. The cheaper ones range from 6-8 bucks. For happy hour at the bar only (change this as it's not that much for deals) you can get tap beers and wines for 5. The waitress offered me a seat there if I wanted but instead i stuck with an 8 dollar imperial stout which was quite delicious. I';ll probably get the good sounding Yuzu spritzer next time.Service was excellent.4.5 Bare 5. It's a newer place so I'll increase it slightly. I thought this was one of those Chinese food spots that cater to the more American palette with good service, nice ambiance, and alcohol. Definitely did not expect it to be somewhat different than similar spots in Chinatown. To start, they dust their roast duck with five spice and anise so its got a slightly szechuan taste. They also added some of the duck drippings to the rice underneath. Their pork ribs came in a stew that was light but flavorful, and went really well with the curly Cantonese style egg noodles. There's also little slices of pickled radish and roasted potatoes as well.The prices are a bit high compared to spots in Chinatown, but I think the prime location and the attention to detail well justifies this. An exciting new edition to LES! Char Sue is a play on ""char siu"", Chinese roast pork, and offers Asian-inspired dishes that will exhilarate your taste buds. The neon pink light-up sign outside instantly catches your attention to the establishment, and you will also notice the hanging meats to the left of the sign, which shows what meats are fresh and available for the day. I have to say the decor of the restaurant really fits - their color schemes work very well together without being too much. It's not super trendy or upscale and is a great place to grab a bite or a drink with friends after work for a good price. The bar in the back is my favorite area because they have BAG HOOKS UNDER THE BAR! This was the first bar I've visited that has those and I definitely give them points for the great idea. They offer a variety of beer and even have wine on tap! Their whole menu is very innovative, including the cocktails. I had the Char Fizzle, which has rice wine instead of liquor and has a unique rhubarb taste. I also ordered their five spice short ribs mantou sandwich, which is a classic Chinese soft white bun with their specialty of meat inside. The meat was SO juicy and flavorful and the wanton crisp was a good crunch paired with the softness of the bun. The only downside was that the bun was a little too dry, but given that the restaurant just opened, it was a pretty good sandwich. Their staff was also very friendly and attentive. 10/10 an amazing experience and will return to try more items on the menu!",https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_kR1Qlqvh4GKDSccE1jlQQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nevb0nRfktkq7hQTgDKXiQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bTZi5FP0b6MDBqo6FgNi6g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/iWKtsfMS6GPwQosPLnx5iw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QSy6Fw1GDQkyTX6Xf7YSrg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YvZ7IKwRoa9xyFEjLHB5kQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/b-235qBhW5KEnGRE5OHsPA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Zbgw6E2Q2r-RgVBtD67hOg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fS7AJ5qsLDNm2KzEG4_erw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2XV7RIhScIOmt-MTA7LJSQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AI0HaQ9mXmfMDbFgX3hM7g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TAUlkyEJMS7pSwEH75QbzA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yZM-oJ445x5k_sAJVDlwPA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wl6jozSDlZSI2xuFhL085Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yvS0KMLD4F1oF0veK_ataA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DXzL9kaCufK5-kzVU8v1oA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JLxV7W3uRF3cK6NUVlDIFw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Va8k5Agxs8FBPBm3tAzkUA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zms4R4ChuXwWgDAbuEFujg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9B5JDyd96oHn975iau5Mlg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GZWL-YQiixP3EzDKOP2niw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rHJBEdjzBEFwO8W64ggYlg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/y6Uys45WuYtrPDE2LvSENw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jn4C20qMDPmC0qPYFmy5ag/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fNxG4Br-u4tCkLSd1A1oHA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PEPfId-mJiMQ7S2tUD6QgA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OuEkCKHvldHVLbSC3jINzQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OgEMpJw_rmtniWcskbjnlQ/258s.jpg,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/cheeky-sandwiches-new-york,cheeky-sandwiches-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Sandwiches,Desserts,NA,"A+++! I LOVE this place! They serve New Orleans food right! You must get their fried chicken biscuit. It's fried chicken, buttermilk biscuit, cole slaw, and gravy for only $6.50 ($7.08) after tax. About 7 bucks for this magic?! Yes please! It's made to order fresh so you need to wait 5-10 minutes. Since this is very heavy I only need one sandwich. If you're extra hungry get two. I sometimes will add a bad of Zapp's Voodoo kettle chips, which is hard to find in NYC. Imagine all the best chip flavors in one bag! It's a little on the salty side but you're planning to eat a friend chicken biscuit so it won't do much extra damage at that point! HahaSpecial mentions: For dessert get the Ben-Yay's (Delicious beignets aka deep-fried nuggets of sweetened dough, served 3 to an order) for a sweet $1! I wish I had room for this today! I had just come from brunch. (Hey don't judge! I was saving it for later when I got hungry again.) All the food is best eaten fresh though. The eggs and biscuit breakfast item is fantastic too. They also sell Cafe du Monde Chicory Coffee for $1. Only down sides: Very limited seating inside. You will smell like fried food after leaving. No bathroom that I could see. The rap/hip hop music sometimes gets insanely loud. I just get my sandwich to go and eat it at a nearby park. The store front is disguised and easy to miss. Didn't see much signage. Look for the store front that's mostly white, looks closed, and covered up in white paper. You're in the right place. I recommend this place highly! Although I had very high hopes for this place...it was just ok:( From the pictures and reviews, I figured it would be amazing but it wasn't. I ordered the fried chicken sandwich, the Beignets, and the pork sandwich. The fried chicken sandwich was extremely extremely bland. Not sure if there was mashed potatoes on it but combining that with the biscuit, you need some type of glaze so you actually have a tasty sandwich! The pork sandwich my boyfriend had and again pretty flavorless. The Beignets were good because I mean it's fried dough but way way too much powdered sugar! I definitely think the workers were very nice and the prices are EXTREMELY fair but this place was personally just not for me! A hole in the wall but with surprisingly good amount of seats. The prices of the sandwiches are on the menu but they're a bit microscopic. The sandwiches are everything everyone is tantalized about, especially the fried chicken biscuit sandwich. It is such a comfort food, the gravy is perfect without making the sandwich a sloppy mushy mess. The biscuit is still very buttery, flaky and did not crumble apart when biting into the crispy chicken. The cabbage slaw gave the perfect crunch and tartness for a huge flavor contrast. The fat girl that I am, I also got the braised short rib on challah bread. After having the chicken biscuit, it just didn't compare. It was still extremely delicious. Make sure you are a pro at squats if you're to use the bathroom. They do have a bathroom offered to the customers even though its kinda in the kitchen. The bathroom feels like a ship cabin, with the toilet seat extremely low. Beware of the hand wash sink, there is only one lever that dispenses extremely hot water if you don't finish washing your hand within 5 seconds. Who knew an unmarked dingy looking storefront would have such a delicious sandwich, from the outside you'd never know what to expect!The sandwich is messy, crispy, drenched with gravy, the biscuit was crispy &amp; fluffy, and worth the $7. It's a sandwich that makes you want to take a nap right after.The menu has a lot of variety: braised short rib, veggie sandwich, pork so if fried chicken isn't your thing there are other options to explore. I can see why this place is so popular. Lately I have been pretty skeptical of a these popular restaurants because I've been let down by so many of them, but this one I was very satisfied. I came here the other night with a friend and we both ordered their famous chicken sandwich. It was so good! To start off, we both appreciated the fact that the sandwich was not only inexpensive ($7) but it was also a decent size, it wasn't no little bird or anything like that. As for the chicken, it was crispy on the outside but the actual meat on the inside was very juicy and tender. The gravy was not overpowering nor was it salty making it a great addition to the sandwich, same goes for the purple slaw. All of the ingredients meshed well together! And as for that biscuit...I could eat those by themselves. They were soft and buttery, not dry and overall a damn good piece of bread. Also, my friend and I made a new friend; Raymond. A very nice guy, who also is an adventurous eater and an overall cool dude. If you're reading this, it was a pleasure talking to you! All in all my friend and I had a great time, enjoying great sandwiches and great conversation. We also got complementary beignet, which were bomb as well! Looking forward to going back! What a great biscuit fried chicken sandwich! You start out with a buttery, flaky but dense enough not to fall apart, with a lightly golden outer shell biscuit, then add a nicely seasoned fried chicken, with a purple cabbage slaw with a nice crunch and just the right amount of vinegar, and then top it all off with a rich and creamy gravy. Sooo good. The place itself is pretty small and it's easy to miss if you aren't paying attention. The storefront doesn't look like much so you won't really notice it if you're just walking by on the street. Inside there's mostly bar seating and then there's one able at the front that can seat 5. My minor complaint for removing a star was that when I came in, they said the only thing they were available to make at that time was the chicken sandwich. While that's what I wanted it is a shame that they weren't able to make any of the other items on their relatively small menu. When I tried to order a soda, they had 4 flavors sitting out but then it turned out that they were out of all but 1 of them. Seems like there might be some inventory issues that need to be worked out. I found this spot on yelp but my friend I went with today has been a bunch. I saw photos of the fried chicken sandwich and that's what I got. It was delicious and packed with flavor! The biscuit added great texture and the slaw and gravy drenched over the chicken was fantastic. It's a small place but wasn't that crowded when we arrived. Friendly staff and quick service I normally don't opt for spots beyond out of my way (I'm from Bergen County NJ) but my good friend from California was visiting so naturally, I had to go look for an EXCEPTIONAL sandwich spot (as he loves sandwiches)I went for the ""Sea""wich and he did the signature ""chicken."" The prices aren't disclosed on the store menu but it's cool that way, you don't decide to not get something for its price.Lastly I thought the prices were so more than reasonable. Mine was around $12 and my friend's was $7. James the guy who attended us was so funny and hospital. It turns out he's a musician so the music playing whiles he's on the clock is always going to be BOMB!!!Also, watch out for the toilet. It doesn't FLUSH but that vintage porta-potty look they were going for was super cute, you can't hate it in my opinion.I promise I'll be back!!!!! Awesome chicken sandwich.Venue: (4/5) the small hole in the wall is easily missed when you are trying to find it.  It looks like someone tore pages of coloring books and pasted it to the outside of the restaurant.  Either way this is most a pickup and eat place.  There were a couple bar seats and one table for a small group (3-4 people max).  Nothing fancy just order move over and get your food when it's made.  Food (4/5) this is an awesome sandwich if you love fried chicken sandwiches and biscuits and gravy.  I'm not a huge biscuit person but appreciate a good biscuit.  I'd recommend to anyone that loves both.  Service (5/5) great service.  The guys that served us were nice and patient as I tried to take photos of my food. The best sandwich shop I've ever been to! I currently live in Austin, Texas, and I still think about how delicious Cheeky's is. The fried chicken and homemade biscuit is an instant classic. In the sandwich world, Cheeky's stands out by offering only 9 sandwich's, each worthy of paragraphs of praise. The attention to detail is second to none, the quality is notable, and the hole-in-the-wall aesthetic complements the experience seamlessly. When I first visited, I literally stumbled on the place--a little white door on the edge of china town, in the heart of the east side, two steps down into a one room restaurant with newspaper wallpaper and bottled sodas and hand pressed sandwiches amongst an array of quirky kitchen tools and machines and ingredients. The space is cozy almost to a fault, forcing the owners to squeeze everything in. But that's half the charm. When I stumbled in, I instantly loved the laid back, casual feel. Even still, I  was skeptical. Could such a small, cramped little artsy sandwich shop produce a quality product? After my first bite, I was in love. Cheeky's is unlike any other restaurant you'll ever visit. Truly one of a kind. Great little place. Hard to find, little to no signage. Inside it's tight quarter's, very little seating, the staff is very freindly and the food is great. Their menu is small but the food packs a punch. They specialize in sandwiches, they have one sandwich for every protein category including a veggie. And for desert they offer biscuit w/jam, bread pudding and ben-yays. We tried their famous fried chicken biscuit sandwich. The chicken was nice and juicy, the biscuit was great as well it didnt just fall apart and the coleslaw and gravy really rounded the sandwich out. We also had to try their ben-yays (their spelling) for me I was a little dissapointed because they were really tiny and also undercooked. The great place, great staff and tasty food. I've gone here several times and I think it's time to give them a review. You're here for the chicken sandwich, I hope. It's a good sandwich! But how it's prepared, the place and the service has got more and more disappointing with every visit. Let's get to the breakdown:Place: small hole in the wall spot. It's usually packed inside so you'll feel super cramped. A few seats at the counter and a table for around 3 people. You're probably better off just ordering to go. Service: where are they hiring these people?? Hipsters with no professionalism and just weird. I don't care if you got that skinny jean type of style with your flower pinned denim jacket but address your customers, greet them! Ask them what they want! And most importantly don't look so lost. I went in the other day and that's exactly what happened. Observations: what's the point of wearing gloves if you're handling everything with them anyway??? Dude is slicing up limes, leaving it there for the flies to land and chill on them then goes off to handle the radio / iPhone to change it to hood rap. Listen, I love music but for you to play rap with profanity is not professional especially if you have younger people who are eating in there. I can only imagine how else they handle prepping of the other stuff where you can't see. Food: get the chicken sandwich. Everything else is not worth it. Like I mentioned it's good but I question how they handle the beginning to end product due to my observations. I'm giving this place a 3 star and not lower because I do enjoy the popular item here but I will not be coming back because I was disgusted &amp; I don't appreciate the vibe I was getting. To each their own. I stumbled upon Cheeky Sandwiches during a search for late night noms. The restaurant was quiet aside from two others who had just finished their sandwiches. The guy behind the counter was super helpful and friendly when we told him it was our first time. He immediately suggested the Chicken Biscuit so we went with that. The chicken was perfectly fried and piping hot. I loved that they served it with gravy. However, the pickled slaw that they served it with was too tart for my taste. Additionally, our fried chicken came on toasted challah instead of a biscuit. They had run out of biscuits but didn't notify us until I inquired.Overall, for $7 it's a pretty good sandwich, but I feel as though I can't give a higher rating since it wasn't the original sandwich. I'll have to make my way back to give it another shot. Cheeky'sWhy have I not come to try this place until recently?? I've had this place bookmarked for years now. 7 years ago I use to come to this area weekly and I remember passing this place not knowing if it's good. I'm so glad this place is still around since there has been numerous changes in the neighborhood.First off, the chicken is a MUST. It's fried chicken on a buttermilk biscuit with coleslaw and gravy. It was such a delicious sandwich! The biscuit is buttery and flaky. The fried chicken is moist and has a nice crunch. I also had the beef which is braised short ribs on challah bread with arugula, cherry tomatoes and horseradish sauce. This was also good, but I prefer the chicken sandwich more. I can't wait till the next time I'm on cheat day. This is all I want! And also, they help you cut the sandwiches in half if you ask. Yummy fried chicken sandwich! Meat was juicy and perfectly fried. Biscuit was really soft and not tooooo crumbly, good for sandwich purposes. Comes with a free beignet!Staff was incredibly friendly too. My only complaint was the wait time, I think it took about 10-12 minutes for them to make my sandwich and I was the only one in the store at the time (around 11:30am). The NYC grit is oozing out of this place. A minimalist space transformed into a southern themed restaurant that looks like it belongs to an underground secret society. All this in the heart of Chinatown. At Cheeky, The chicken biscuit and the poboy are the two popular items. Beef, pork, and vegetarian sandwiches are also available, along with beignets straight from cafe du monde. As far as the food goes, I can't say anything in particular blew me away. The biscuit was a good size, but it had more of a bread consistency, while the beef sandwich lacked in flavor. The bread pudding is on the dry side. The egg sandwich with muenster is pretty satisfying. That might be your best bet. Cheesy+Fluffy eggs=winner winner. That being said, it's a great atmosphere with friendly service and fair prices. Cheeky is a decent option for a quick bite. Very good fried chicken sandwich, pretty bad beignets (or benyays as they call them). The fried chicken sandwich comes with chicken (duh), slaw, and gravy, piled between two soft and crumbly biscuits. Although I'd have liked a little more spice or vinegar to cut through the savory, it curbed my fried chicken craving. The beignets, on the other hand, were just plain bad. The inside was extremely mushy, rather than chewy, and the powdered sugar was clustered in a few places rather than spread throughout. Its only saving grace is that it was $1 for 3 pieces (we threw out 2 of the 3). Overall, a pretty solid place. Their other sandwiches looked and smelled good also! Just skip the beignets. Cheeky Sandwiches is the place to go for a solid fried chicken sandwich. The place itself is pretty hard to find and there is limited seating, however it is definitely a must go to spot for their fried chicken sandwich . The biscuit and slaw on the fried chicken sandwich really stood out and was the highlight of the sandwich for me. The chicken itself was of course tasty, but nothing special. They make everything fresh which means you might have to wait a while for your sandwich but it is definitely worth it. Another thing that really stood out to me was their hospitality and service. The staff was nice and offered to throw away our stuff, and get us water and napkins. Overall it was an A1 experience Wow. Wow. Wow.I've even looking for a true Po Boy for a long time New York. Finally, found one. When you walk in, disregard decor. Rock out to the incredible music, chat with the regulars and grab not one but TWO po boys. One for now and one for later. It's not very large but it is filling, I went with fried shrimp. The French bread was warm and not too chewy, flavorful fried shrimp and the sauce wasn't too tangy. That's super important when making a Po Boy, let the shrimp have its moment. Lettuce was fresh, again you weren't skimped on the amount of shrimp or toppings. You can also add the rare but delicious voodoo chips. Perfect addition to such a great sandwich. I can never find them but when I do I make sure to grab one. I'm ordering my second one now. Two thumbs up here all the way. Went to Cheeky Sandwich after reading the reviews on Yelp. I have a habit of taking apart sandwiches before I eat them and found this strand of hair sticking to the tomato of the shrimp po boy I ordered, as seen on photo here. I don't know where this hair comes from and don't care to know. I lost my appetite after that. Won't be going back",https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IwgJEZEA9nK77KK6FaHZng/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xfO5MBQ6xE6cTdOOwblQ7Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9_pCTlajdlKEtZLlVlwlHw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/J5ePPhwWfm_DN99_5ielog/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XGGQOLhQIL-Y8Y-CdHeOPg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/G79gsCE2v_ZOVtzyVPNqxA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JrOS_JvA8ez0VW55AXtUxQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BZ9m2kgxhq57GrMYjArV1A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/h18MhAyIA0sivUJsnSm_4w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Na--wjjJZ38-kCpmZR1EmQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cx3qFyFHlhP6hOFiQSgwgQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oZ8t_AwdLFhed1vGkoTm1w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RRfAYhQvqrUVeXwmGCVYFA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GXTADiMlrRmaTUfwiBjWBQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6P12h4cnDusztC58ld6yRg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0Rf-h_ld-f4GC0CVP6EOKg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GtFRz-lNWQOf0dGV0ByqPA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oNfLGNywsdJ2i4cad_DqtA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QaybsxHvYzVieS3RIw8R9w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/W5n0a2lkM8Er21G_W8Xjzw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lyYHbCNbUcQUw6u1uvgjhQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xTb2oyLJndmhGf9Sx5dPUA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/40c2wfAkpACAA8rmXseh_g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/y5Ets9dWXbXHLy6gdzkmWA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/J_AhsHmWVowXbhaOeInTHA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SWP55AbF8ZFnefGoQXcW7A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/e9WvzEGpf9E3Gr4ng3YPkw/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/cheese-grille-new-york,cheese-grille-new-york,New York,10002,NY,American (Traditional),Comfort Food,Sandwiches,"I had Buffalo chicken grilled cheese, and I'm pretty satisfied! The pic is what my friend ordered; triple cheese. Simple classic option. They have fresh bread everyday delivered from a certain bakery.  And they understand how to make it golden without burning them~It's great to have this for brunch~ and the amount is good for a lady. The grilled cheese is all about grilling the cheese all kind. What a taste to beauty and the delicious to delicate. With some nice interior design makes ambience better and good atmosphere with huge sitting area . Including the pictures on the wall makes even brighter interior.The buffalo chicken grilled cheese was perfection to taste that you could easily finish and order the second one . Don't get me wrong it's big enough for a lunch. Grilled cheese the caramelized onion makes it haven of spot with that beautifully served home made tomato soup smelling the all fresh tomato can make your lunch even better You know, we all crave for some good grilled cheese once in a while for sure and this is the spot that is taking your craving out of your mind because the grilled cheese only could be made this delicious with some or many kind of sauce you can choose.And like most people here saying it's good or it's the best. For me there is know best food that's why I look around for food all the time.  But good food is good food I love to be back soon to get that buffalo chicken grilled cheese with that tomato soup. Dope grilled cheese sandwiches. Enough said. First time trying cheese grille after seeing it all over IG (thanks @devourpower). Really cute interior with a good amount of seating. Staff was really friendly they even bring your food to u after u order. I would say it's a cute little date spot (granted u both really love cheese) especially in the summer. Now on to Le Food ...The buffalo chicken grilled cheese was amazingly gooey, crunchy, and spicy. The sweet potato tots were bomb (although I wish they were a little crunchier, I'm that weird tater tot lover who likes them super crunchy). The cheese fries, which was def more cheese than fries, were a bit soupy and the amount of cheese left over after eating all the fries kind of made me mad (who wants to waste cheese?). Regardless I was def pleased with what I came here for...the grilled cheese. Will be coming back soon to try the Mac n cheese! The food was so good! I wonder if it's because this dinner was my first meal of the day. I ordered the ham grilled cheese and it was so good!!! I wish the portions were a bit bigger compared to the price, but I was full after my sandwich, cup of soup, and bites of my friend's Mac and cheese. Grilled cheese: the caramelized onions were amazing! And the Dijon gave it such a great kick. My only request is that they spread out the onions and Dijon better because the edges which were missing those two ingredients weren't nearly as good. The Dijon was all in the center, so I'd get bites of intense, nasal passage clearing burns of Dijon mustard. Buffalo Mac and cheese: my friend liked it but I wouldn't eat it again. It was too heavy and fatty tasting because of the fried, battered chicken and the decadent, heavy sauces. Tomato soup: I liked it but it was too expensive for a cup (4-5oz for $3.50). Overall, the sandwich impressed me so much I'd come back! Traveled all the way down here to try out one of their grilled cheese sandwiches and boy was the wait worth it. As soon as I walked in I was greeted behind the guy at the registered and made we feel welcomed. I order their ""Italian"" grilled cheese and it was made to perfection. I will recommend this place to anyone. Nom Nom... We ordered a Buffalo Chicken (4.2/5 stars), Three Cheese (4/5) and fries (2/5). Overall pretty satisfied with our lunch here. The bread claims to arrive from Balthazar daily, didn't taste much better than your typical basic white bread. Personally I like more of a grill on my grilled cheeses. Wish we passed on the Fries.... lackluster, fried well... but very basic and seasoned 0% (no salt bae here). Chill staff. Cheers to the classy table of belching female tourists preaching about the difference between ""love"" and ""in love"" ~ burrrppppp! This establishment epitomizes why I love New York--this city manages to turn the most basic foods that you would never crave in any other city (e.g. bagels, pizza, grilled cheese sandwiches) into one of the best foods you've ever had. I've been living out of a hotel down the street since moving to the city and walk past this place everyday. There's a poster outside that reads something along the lines of, ""Best grilled cheese in the city or drink on the house."" I scoffed at this for a good week, like best grilled cheese? Low bar much? Ever read a sign that said, ""Best candy corn in the city""? Not only do all candy corn taste the same, but also who the hell craves candy corn/grilled cheese?But it got to me. I craved a grilled cheese today. I walked in around noon on a cold Sunday and ordered the basic ham and cheese sandwich for $8. Dijon, gruyere, caramelized onions, white bread, whatever. Let's add a bowl of spicy tomato soup too because all the reviews said the portions were small, which really worried me because I grew up in middle of nowhere California and expect nothing less than Cheesecake Factory portions. The bread had a larger area than I expected, at least 5x5, and perfectly crisp. Turned to the side, the sandwich was pretty thin, with a small slice or two of ham, some caramelized onions, and 2 thin layers of cheese. I can't think of a way for the sandwich to be thicker though, because the ratio of bread to cheese to meat was just right. You have to get the spicy tomato soup--it elevates all the flavors of the sandwich without ruining the texture. The interior has a line of tables and chairs by the window so you can sit and enjoy this experience alone or sit at the counters to socialize. I highly recommend savoring this experience for yourself at least once. It's too easy to scarf down a piece of bread while talking without realizing that you finished your food. The downside was that the food took more than 20 minutes to come out and the restaurant was hardly full, so I wouldn't come here again if I were looking for a quick lunch before spending an awfully long day in Ikea. I would order for delivery or come back at night to have this along with some beers with a few bros--it stays open late and has a decent selection of drinks. So my friend and I kept scrolling by these delicious sandwiches on Instagram so we decided to finally check them out in person. We came to Cheese Grille on a Wednesday evening around 4:30/5 o'clock. Thanks to Yelp I already knew what I wanted...The Sloppy Joe grilled cheese which consists of sloppy joe ground beef and jalapeos. I also got an order of the sweet potato tots which are supposed to come with some type of sriracha Mayo which they must have forgotten so I just used ketchup. In addition to our food, we ordered a carafe of one of their white wines. The food was delicious and reasonably priced. The food is also super photogenic; therefore, you can get some great snaps. The ambiance of this place is super casual and laid back. Absolutely no frills. I'd definitely return and recommend to others in the area who might be looking for a quick bite to eat. However, I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to return even though the food was good. So I've ordered take out from Cheese Grille the past three days in a row.  Not only because it warmed me up during our recent blizzard, but because the GCs are outta this world!  Especially when you add tomato and truffle oil.  They offer other sandwich toppings like caramelized onions, basil, etc.  I also add a cup of tomato soup to dip my sandwich in.  You can opt for gluten free bread as well.  I'm a big fan as these bread/cheese combos as they make me feel rite at home.  Comfort food at its finest! We were in a cheesy mood the other day so we  went and got some. The location is simple in decor, bright and open. Communal height too seating. The young man taking our order at the register was cheerful and very helpful in terms of explaining selections. We opted for the buffalo chicken Mac &amp; Cheese. It was very good, lots of spicy kick. Keep a cool beverage on the side. I added some BBQ sauce to the Mac &amp; Cheese just to balance the heat just beyI have low tolerance for heat but again it was very good. We also purchased the Little Italy grilled cheese sandwich which has a Pesto spread, oh so good! Overall, on point selections. I am sure we will return to try a few other menu options. When you are craving grilled cheese this is the place to go! It may seem like a simple concept that can be done at home, but going to this restaurant is worth it. It's not terribly pricey and your grilled cheese is probably amazing. I came with a friend and she loved her grilled cheese as well. She ordered the Sloppy Joe and she was a big fan. My order-The Mediterranean and Fries *yum* It was honestly so good! It didn't take long to prepare and it was very filling. Service- The guys who were funny and polite. You don't get served at this restaurant, you have to order at the register and you take your receipt with your number. The Place-Very chill, no one was there when we first arrived, but it started to pick up and it was pretty nice. It had a relaxed vibe, which is perfect when you are eating comfort food. Yummmmmm nothing like a crispy, melty grilled cheese with some hot tomato soup on a cold day!!Upon entering the restaurant, it was actually a little awkward. A man (who I later realized works there and was perhaps the manager?) completely didn't acknowledge me. I was a little confused too because I wasn't sure if you order first? Or get seated and they take your order. In any case, someone who was cleaning acknowledged me once it was clear that the other guy wasn't about to say a word. It was then made clear that I can order at the counter then they would bring the food. The man that took my order and the man who seemed to have been cleaning were very nice and helpful. The guy that seemed to be the manager was an interesting character though.. not that I saw him be mean to customers, but he seemed to very much micro manage and talk down to the employees... not necessarily directly relevant to customers, but still of interesting mention as far as environment feels of the establishment. There is some bar seating and some table seating. Good for anyone stopping in on their own, fun date, or meetup w friends. Random street art type stuff along the walls and really random stickers plastered. Casual and fun feel overall!The food though. Dear god. Crispiest grilled cheese I've ever had in my life that wasn't burnt. I got the Little Italy. It wasn't a heaping sandwich, but it was filling enough along w the cup of spicy tomato soup. Cheesy enough for sure, I wish there was more pepperoni, but man. The pesto really gave it a nice touch. The soup, while hot w a little kick, was also refreshing in a sense. The lemonade to accompany was pretty tasty as well - not too tangy/sour and not too sweet. I will definitely be back. There are too many amazing things that must be tried here o.o [Visited Back in April]This is a bit sad, but I stopped by with Hubby with the intention of eating a grilled cheese sandwich, but Hubby wasn't amused. The entire trip was basically me eating my way through Manhattan and it amounted to eating something nearly every hour. It was our last day there and I walked in... and decided to appease Hubby with just getting the sweet potato tater tots to go. We had a plane to catch in a few hours. I still think about the grilled cheese sandwich I missed but next time! Back to what I did buy: the tater tots were pretty good! I finally ate them on the plane so they weren't quite fresh but still satisfying. Tater tots were always a love of mine but sweet potatoes were a new one and I don't regret it one bit. I think we were their first customers of the day and the man did a slight double take when I only ordered the tots but got over it in a split second. We got out order in no time and we were on our way. The decor was nice; I would have liked to take my time to enjoy the goodies, but I still had a few more places I wanted to stop before we had to head to the airport.'Till next time, Cheese Grille! Whoa! Not a major grilled cheese person but dang this was really good.  LES has so many place to eat it's hard to pick a place. I was in the mood for something f quick and found Cheese Grille. Parking and traffic is annoying around her but worth the stop.I placed my order at the registered and since I love to people watch, they had plenty of open window seats so I planted my little behind there. 1. Goat Gouda, bacon and avocado??? AHHH so good. 2. Three cheese w/ bacon. So crispy it was great. Also ordered a cup of tomato soup. Had a bit of a kick. I have had better but was good w the grilled cheese. 3. Mac and cheese bites. 5 decent pieces. Was good not the best I have ever had but yummy. ;) I had quite a unique experience here and I doubt that it will ever be repeated, so I struggled with how to rate this place. The food was pretty solid, but definitely not life changing. So maybe a 4/5. But The immaturity of the people working there brought the score down to a 3/5. While I was ordering at the register a TV prank was happening in their very tiny sitting space. While I was just far enough away to be able to try and ignore it, my mother was sitting right in the middle of it. She eventually got freaked out enough to leave her seat and come up by me at the register (there was a man wearing 3D glasses who was freaking out, knocking things off tables, waving his arms frantically and bumping into people). Finally, the actors stopped, let everyone know it was a prank and that it was for a TV show. Too late, my mom was already pissed and didn't find it amusing. Frankly, I didn't either. But I'd just paid, so they already had our money. My mother expressed her concerns and was visibly upset, but it didn't seem to phase the man at the counter. In fact, he could barely keep from giggling as he explained that they had signed an agreement with this company and couldn't do anything to stop what had happened. We're I the business owner, I would be concerned about losing a costumer. I would, BARE MINIMUM, offer to add a drink or side dish for free, get the order out ASAP, and continue to check on the guests to make sure they were comfortable in every other way. But again, all he could do was giggle. Thank goodness the TV people were better. Maybe because they just wanted us to sign their paperwork. But after hearing my mom's concerns, they immediately offered to pay for our meal. We got a a grilled cheese with bacon and avocado. Pretty good! We also got a side of sweet tots. They were great with the chipotle sauce (which was extra $). Not sure I'm dying to come back to this place.... Cheese Grille is great when it comes to selling themselves on Instagram, though the actual experience of coming here is just okay.Came here on a recent NYC trip with high hopes for a delicious/cheesy experience. The counter worker was pleasant and walked us through the menu and we placed our order. The wait was fair, though admittedly there weren't many people there ahead of us. The food was very aesthetically pleasing when it arrived (as a brief perusal of Instagram can verify), though the taste didn't measure up to the hype, nor did the portions for the price. As an added thought, the drink selection here was quite good.Overall, I would consider coming back with friends for a (very) light bite to eat. Guess I just set my expectations a tad too high.Overall: 3.0 stars----------Pros:- Food is good, and very aesthetically appealing.- On warm/nice days, the open design of the restaurant is a great way to enjoy the evening.Cons:- Didn't quite live up to the hype.- Prices/portions were below expectations. Best grill cheese I've had in a while. The sweet potatoe tater tots are amazing, especially covered in cheese. You won't leave here disappointed!? The food itself is pretty dang good. We order the sloppy joe, garden melt and spicy tomato soup.  The bread on both was crispy to the end, great for dipping into the soup.  The garden melt was light and delicious, didn't feel heavy at all.  The soup however was light in both salt and spicy, could have used more spicy. All in all, food was great. Definitely more of a snack place than a meal.  But a must return kind of spot. Very satisfied with everything.The food was great and the service was great. It's a perfect place to stop by before or after Soho shopping I think. I had 'Little Italy' and everything was perfect. The bathroom facility was a bit small but somehow fits the restaurants mood? Overall, recommended for everyone! After a not so stellar first visit, I decided to return to try out the ""Sloppy Joe"" and Onion Rings-- which caught my eye last time. The grilled cheese was grilled perfectly, not too much cheese, not too much ground beef, and to top it off, I dipped in Chipotle sauce, which totally enhanced the experience. (Kudos to Michael for making the suggestion). The Onion rings also hit the spot, and weren't too greasy. As I waited for my order I checked out their Instagram page, and noticed they had Mac and Cheese--- I guess that give me no choice but to return for a third time to give that a shot!",https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GsPzRIcD5GhmLh6PBFOTFg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MCgsYKLCpVJl4_V4_EvNCg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xqaOc099uuz73eML5tLqKQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5MabM2fNme8kOcrWB1BtBg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SPILdzjAnxWDgOxmhmLEmQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rsYZjppifw1VtnJQtchyhw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5GjQzbvy39ECkdCnNnD4AA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/14DUvhQ33kwYy6tRoNfCSA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/iRkbC44ILdnwMI-TsuqstQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KREVsKZIibAGeXeSREGUVg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Q41p6MMgmlx1-UVvWCWuyw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jw2Y9MLF1Hak0vph5D_qhw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cF-0h4NiUGDtuE3rx0bZ_A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/H49n3eH-QdzqCjjlsthk6Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FWA3Pc1nLlFtYdLpAu_K7Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yXjrwyNlHM_obd_K_qiSag/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4Rfrgq1epp-709A1kjuT8g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/auee0KNGewChL_ZCGEte4A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3HCDlpN6Vfpdlqh6aqRrew/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/I7rlATjFGyps62RVswry4A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HY1AcXfxeN9-zYqsUf9L8A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LhW_XOh5IO9pySSPEhFY0g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IrZGhRZDQqkqx7D8s_HBXw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fYF03sb734EiDt2a0L4eAA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Do0pM9ulbw5bPSfK1os9HQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/iwXrcAJPW2c0ktI82RgPlw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Ot5ho-0Fdn1a1_PJ06Arsg/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/claw-daddys-new-york,claw-daddys-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Cajun/Creole,Seafood,NA,"This place is not just for seafood lovers, if you're seafood hater, they have amazing happy hour drinks and wings special till 7:30!If you love seafood, this place is heaven for you! Love their grilled (baked?) oysters for $1.50 during happy hour. If you missed happy hour, then get the Cajun shrimp bags. I personally think shrimps are better than Crawfish but it's up to your personal taste.I've tried almost every caprisuns and love every single one of them! Also came here on a wednesday for Craw Feast, and that was absolutely amazing!! Come for the happy hour and apps, do the boil - I had oysters and crawfish last time and lunch was good!But this review is for the ""Feast"" that was $35 a person. The snow crab legs were delicious, but we had a rotten clam that smelled and the shrimp was not fresh and definitely over-boiled. You know how a shrimp gets all mushy and hard to peel when the meat sticks to the shell? Yeah, that was 95% of the shrimp tonight. Won't be going back for the Feast - unfortunately not worth it for a table full of shrimp and clams since crawfish are out of season. Definitely could've used a few more crab legs! If you're debating whether to go here or the boil, Just go to the boil... the food was so mediocre. The medium seasoning was so hot I couldn't enjoy my food and the mild had no kick to it. The Dungeness crab was not sweet at all, actually just tasted like water. Very disappointing. The grilled oysters And sweet potato fries were good and so were the deviled eggs... skip the adult Capri sun too... they were strong for someone who drinks all the time but not tasty at all. There's so much more I could write but this place lacked well everything. The atmosphere was boring the drinks sucked the food tasted weird and worse of all.... I spent over $200 on a meal for twonot including tip. This isn't a 5 star restaurant there's no reason I should be spending this type of money at a bland mediocre seafood spot. Not as good as other similar themed restaurants. Although the decor and staffs were nice, I would not recommend coming here for the Louisiana seafood boil. I suggest coming here for the happy hour specials and then grab entrees elsewhere. This place has really good happy hour. Food and drinks were priced reasonably priced for happy hour. The Cajun wings were addicting; the wings were flavorful, crispy and not drenched in oil. The raw oysters were decent for a dollar each, but the showstopper was definitely the grilled ones. The grilled oysters were amazing! They were garlicky, buttery and cheesy; definitely get them. The crab cake fritters were good, but definitely passable next time. The adult Capri suns were good, but packed with garnishments and ice. Still delicious though. Overall, I don't recommend the Louisiana boil because it didn't taste fresh. The shrimps were all overcooked and tasted mushy. The sauce was okay but not comparable to The Boil.Come here for happy hour, but skip the Louisiana boil, especially the shrimp. The short: super fun and chill on a Friday night, and tons of really, really good happy hour deals. The longer: we came here as a party of 8 for my friend's birthday. We all LOVED it. On Friday there's a DJ spinning very loud music. The place was packed with couples, friends and some families. We started with the adult Capri Suns. I had the Yours Truly sans raspberry syrup... and was very, very happy. The drink had really pretty floating rose petals in it. Then, we shared a bunch of appetizers before the seafood boil. The fried pickles came in big chunks. The Cajun fries were perfectly crispy. The lobster roll had traces of truffle oil. The chicken biscuits were messy but delish. The star though: grilled oysters. Holy shiz. Delicious. Then, we did the seafood boil. I'm thrilled I got just water boiled king crab legs. They were perfect. I didn't love the head-on shrimp (head freaked me out a little), but the less wimpy people went nuts over it and the Cajun seasoning. We'd definitely be back here to take advantage of the happy hour deal. Bonus: Yelp cash back! I went for a friends birthday and the four of us got the claw feast with the claw daddy special sauce. Unfortunately claw fish wasn't in season so we didn't get to try it, but the shrimp and snow crab legs were delicious. The sauce went well with everything especially the corn.The waiters checked up on us only once, but when we had requests they fulfilled it with a smile. The menu states that they automatically add 18% gratitude for tables of 6 or more, however, it was automatically added for our table of 4.We made reservations, however, they will not seat you unless all members are present. The portion for the claw feast was also enough to fill 4 people. They give bibs and gloves to eat which is very nice especially knowing how messy it could get eating from a table with sauce and food in the middle. I came here with my boyfriend's family last weekend for his birthday. We tried to book online and call ahead on the day of, but they said to just show up.I came in around 1:30 on Sunday and was told a 15-30 minute wait; the guy was kind of vague and apathetic. The place was pretty busy. However, he said we could sit at the bar, which we did once his family arrived 10 minutes later.The bartender was super helpful and explained that we could order our food at the bar and get it moved to our table as long as we closed out there. We put in our seafood orders and started with a round of a dozen and a half happy hour oysters. (Happy hour runs all day on Sunday, and includes dollar oysters!) These are not the most knock-your-socks-off oysters of your life, but they were balanced and juicy. I'm kind of picky about my oysters and I would have kept eating these forever. Big crowd pleasers.Our table was ready after about 15 minutes, so we closed out and switched over. Then we got our bibs and gloves and suited up. Our food came out in about 5 minutes.My boyfriend and I focused on the king crab legs (MP, I think it was $30something a pound) in mild lemon pepper. Awesome. The snow crab legs ($23) and shrimp ($15) were also good, in medium Claw Daddy's Special. Both of them came with potatoes and corn in the bag. We also had a round of clams ($15) that were pretty good, as well as crab cake fritters ($9) that were much better than expected. Garlic noodles ($6) are not what I expect at a Cajun spot, but they were tasty and would be a welcome addition if you're trying to fill up.They warn you about the spice here, but even the medium I tried wasn't very spicy. The king crab was our best choice, as well as the medium Claw Daddy's Special sauce. Do note that they don't serve crawfish in December.The only other seafood boil spot I've been to in New York was Hot n Juicy, which had slightly better sauces. However, the atmosphere is just so far ahead at Claw Daddy's-- you're in a modern, light filled space, and it feels much more fun than being in a basement sports bar. Service was excellent. Bathrooms were clean.If you're looking to eat a lot of seafood, Claw Daddy's is a great choice. Do reserve if you can, and do try to take advantage of the happy hour. This Lower East Side seafood restaurant comprises a wide dining area with few communal tables in the middle, while the Mezzanine serves as plush waiting area-cum-cocktail lounge where they serve light bites and cocktails while you wait for a table, which could be a long wait if you did not reserve ahead! if you're not ravenous, light snack is somewhat adequate.For the main entree, we ordered Snow crabs and Shrimps Combo for two people with Corns and potatoes served with plastic hand gloves and bibs. It was not as messy as I might have anticipated.This place is definitely ideal for groups but probably not romantic enough for date night. A taste of NOLA in NYC...The grilled oysters are amazing the clams I would not recommend unless you like them really chewy. As far as drinks the Jays a dream was amazing. The fried pickles are not bad but too thick for my taste would have been a lot better if they were sliced thinner.The place itself is on the small side. Came here early on a Saturday it was practically empty perfect time to go. Full of flavor and fun! I've wanted to try Claw Daddy's ever since going to The Boil. It's a very comparable restaurant in both cuisine and price - both are cajun seafood spots. Claw Daddy's interior is clean and spacious. They had some nice lighting around the restaurant, maybe because it's the holiday season. I was with a group of five folks and we were immediately seated on a Monday at 7pm. We started off with adult caprisuns (flavored soju drinks), which are very fun and tasty. We were in time for happy hour (5-730 week nights), so we ordered grilled clams and grilled oysters, and crabcake fritters to start. Every appetizer was brilliant. The sauce paired with the crabcakes was well made and paired very well with the dish.For the main meal, we ordered a 2lbs of shrimp, 2lbs of clams, and a pound of snowcrab legs, all in a medium spice and claw daddy's special sauce. We ordered two sides of bread, a side of sausage and 3 sides of garlic noodles. I can talk for hours about the garlic noodle. The sauce is fairly tangy and rich in flavor, though it wasn't nearly as spicy as I would have liked it. The shrimp is the best bang for your buck as their shell is lighter than crabs or clams. All seafood was fresh, and if you order more than 2lbs, they give you potatoes and corn. The corn is a must-try in that sauce. The GARLIC NOODLES !!!! I would get them 100x over. They're hot, super garlicky, cheesy, and just a pile of goodness. We couldn't stop eating them and kept ordering more. It's also a nice palette cleanser from all the seafood doused in the rich sauce. All in all, Claw Daddy's is a fun and messy experience. I would definitely go again, but I'd choose to go to The Boil over it only because the special Claw Daddy's sauce was personally, a little too salty. This place has some of the best Cajun seafood you'll find in the city. We ordered the snow crab legs with a side of corn and potatoes and it was really amazing. They also have some great happy hour deals. Our favorite was the Capri Sun cocktail (not pictured here) with rose petals floating in it. The ambience was also nice and cozy. The atmosphere in general was chill and fun to spend a Friday evening at. Definitely will visit again. Most people love Claw Daddy's for their great seafood, or Lower East Side ambiance. All that stuff is good but I just care about their adult Capri Suns lol.You can choose between 7 different flavors, I always get Just a Dream ( my favorite ). Regularly the drinks are $10 but if you go during happy hour ( 5pm-7:30pm ) you can get it for $7 - and we all love a good happy hour.Now don't get me wrong, they are not the strongest drink you probably will have in your life. They are actually relatively sweet and smooth BUT they will sneak up on you lol. Before you realize it you probably had about 4 and once you stand up you will feel it lol.Im not a big seafood lover, so I don't want to judge the food because I really only go to Claw Daddy's for the drinks.Tip: Claw Daddy's opens up at 5pm and gets crowded quickly ( it be a line outside before it opens ) so call ahead to make a reservation to save yourself the aggravation or opt to sit at the bar. Do you ever get an overwhelming craving for crab claws? No? Just me? Well it happens to be on the regular, and seeing Claw Daddy's $35 special I knew I'd found the place to get my fix. What it lacked in ambiance it made up for in delicious boil sauce, and a couple of standout items that are enough to keep it on my radar should another craving hit me with a vengance. We came after crawfish season, which was fine with me because I don't actually like the little bugs, so our boil was chock full of shrimp, crab, and clams. The star of the show though? The sausage. Smoky and rich, it was some of the best andouille I've ever had, and dipped in the garlicky butter sauce? Heaven in my mouth. The crab was also delicious, succulent and not in short supply. Clams were a little chewy and the shrimp was a little mushy but a fine vehicle for the sauce, which I recommend mopping up with the provided bread the moment you've run out of room for crustaceans. Pro-tip: we're spice lovers and almost went with the ""spicy"" option. The server warned us against it and talked us down to the ""medium."" This was 100% the right call -- it was still spicy, but not overwhelming. I think kicking it up a notch might've made such a huge amount of food hard to eat. The adult capri-suns are a cute idea but so sweet -- I'll be sticking to iced tea or water next time. Beware of the 2:45 reservation spot -- the kitchen closes at 3:15, and the bar at 3:30, so there's definitely a little bit of rushing that happens if you're in that last slot. The canjun lobster is great and I love the sweet potato chips. The crab cake is okay. The environment and service is good. A nice meal. I don't think you can go wrong with this place if you're looking for a cajun seafood spot. We ordered the shrimp and snow crab with the original claw daddy's sauce and were not disappointed. We also came during happy hour which consisted of $1 wings-- which were amazing, I'd highly recommend ordering them. The capri suns are also a fun drink, and it was cool because they were all made with soju but they were a little too strong for my liking and tasted very similar to the mixed drinks you'd drink at a college frat party. The cajun fries and mac 'n cheese were also nice side dishes. I'd say this is a fun place to go with a group of friends especially since you can get seats for larger parties (they also take reservations which is a plus). It also can be a great date spot to go with a boyfriend or girlfriend (not for a first date though because it does get messy). I'd recommend making reservations if possible because the place is located in a popular area and it does get pretty packed. Claw Daddy's offers great seafood at a reasonable price. It's spacious and can easily accommodate a large group. Probably not the best place to take a date to since eating here can get a little messy. Try to make a reservation before going since Claw Daddy's gets packed. The adult caprisuns are not only cute but also very delicious. Their grilled oysters give me New Orleans flashbacks, which is always a good thing. All of their seafood tastes fresh and packs a lot of flavor.If possible, try to make it to their happy hour from 5:00 - 7:30pm. The have $1 oysters and good drink deals. This review might not be as comprehensive as possible considering I didn't try the seafood, but felt I'd leave my two cents regardless!Came with a party of 6 on a Friday night. We had a reservation and were glad we did - the restaurant was crowded! My friend and I stuck to the cocktails (adult Capri Suns!) and the Cajun fries while the rest of our group got some variation of the boil. They enjoyed it for the most part, had a few complaints / confusion over portion sizes, but overall had a good time. The fries, though, were out of this world. Some of the best I've ever had! Hot, crispy, meaty, they were insane. We kept ordering more and more.As for drinks, I chose the Sweet Georgia and enjoyed it so much. It was sweet but also strong, and the cranberry really helped balance the Soju out. My friends got the Blush and the Just a Dream and loved all of them. I'd come back for the drinks alone.Our server was so friendly and energetic, offering suggestions left and right and engaging in small talk. It warmed my heart how nice he was! I'll definitely be back to try the seafood feast when I'm hungrier but I'm already so impressed with my one experience here! What a fun, interesting restaurant / concept (and love the cute bibs and gloves that come with the feast as well). TL;DR Happy hour 5-7:30PM$1 oysters and chicken wings$1.50 baked clams and oysters$7 cocktails (normally $10)$5 draft beersVery good happy hour for oyster lovers. Mild is still kinda spicySi les gustan beber deben pasar por aqu entre las 5 y 7:30. I'm always down for a happy hour and I've gone to Claw Daddy's a few times. The drinks are always on point.  I ordered a couple of oysters, chicken wings, baked clams and baked oysters. They were really good. For drinks my fiend and I got Just A Dream and Sweet Georgia. For the prosecco lovers the Sweet Georgia is for you. When the waiter came out with our drinks he realized one of them was incorrect and quickly get it swapped out for us. We also got a pound of crawfish and head-on shrimp. Mild sauce. My one problem was that this wasn't mild at all. It was more of a medium spice than mild. We ordered 2 pounds because we would get potatoes and corn. We got 2 red potatoes and 2 quarters(?) of corn? Personally, I didn't think it was worth it. I'll stick to just one pound next time. The garlic noodles as a side was pretty good! Despite the spice situation this is definitely still a go-to for me. Tip: Make a reservation early ahead of time -- especially if you have a big group if you want to have the""Claw Feast"".The Claw Feast is a hefty serving of crawfish, snow crabs, shrimp, and clam (2 lbs of each) and a generous serving of corn, potatoes and sausage on the side. This is all for $35/person with a minimum of 4 people. If you have less than 4 people, you cannot participate in this feast unless you want to pay for 4 people's worth of the feast. You get to choose a type of sauce for your seafood. The most popular options are the Claw Daddy's Special or garlic butter. I chose the Claw Daddy's Special which came spicy (with your preference of spice level). I selected medium but they were not as spicy as I anticipated. The drinks we ordered were the ""Adult Capri Suns"". They were cocktails with very fruity flavors in a little Capri sun-like pouch. Very delicious and minimal alcohol taste! You get a pair of gloves, paper plate, utensils, a wet wipe and 2 buckets for your shells. You also get a side of bread! Overall, this was an extremely filling meal. Although it wasn't all-you-can-eat, the portion size was almost too much to finish between 4 hungry people. The seafood was very delicious and paired with an excess of sauce: perfect. The service here is adequate. They get you what you need and check up periodically, you can't really ask for more. Would definitely come back if I'm in the mood for a lot of seafood! I had a great time!! The food was delicious this will be my permanent all birthday spot.

https://www.yelp.com//biz/clinton-street-baking-company-new-york-5,clinton-street-baking-company-new-york-5,New York,10002,NY,Bakeries,Breakfast & Brunch,American (Traditional),"I've been wanting to try this brunch spot, and finally made a point of getting here on a Saturday morning. Luckily we planned for the long wait: 90 minutes for a table for two. So I'd definitely recommend getting there to put your name down, and plan something to do while you wait. Once you manage to get seated and order, the food comes out pretty quickly. Which is very necessary because after such a long wait we were famished.I ordered the Huevos Rancheros with chorizo. Such a good decision! It came with whipped sour cream, guac, salsa, beans, and two sunny side up eggs on a tortilla. Filling and satisfying. We also shared a plate of the Blueberry Pancakes for the table. I think you definitely need to try the pancakes if it's your first time here. They are so buttery and fluffy! Great brunch and a must try, but not sure how soon I'll return. There are so many other great spots I need to try. TLDR: the best fried chicken and waffles I've ever had; use the NoWait app to minimize wait time; cash only; friendly and attentive staff; large portionsLive close by to Clinton Street Baking Company and have always wanted to try it, but was discouraged by the long wait times. However, one of my friends mentioned that it was recently added to the NoWait app (where you can virtually put yourself in line if you are close enough to the restaurant), so decided to give this place a try on a late Sunday morning with my two roommates.We put our names down on the app around 10:45am and then headed over to the restaurant about 45 minutes later. Although the app said our wait time was up and to report to the hostess, we still had to wait an additional 30 minutes (unsure if this was due to the app or the restaurant). This was slightly disappointing, but better than the usual wait time.The restaurant was bustling with all tables and bar stools filled. Bright light was shining through the large windows and the place had a ""diner"" feel to it with wooden tables, regular and booth seating, a stainless steel counter at the bar, and chalkboards listing daily specials.While everything on the menu looked great, I knew that I had to try the fried chicken and waffles. My roommates opted for the crispy potato pancakes with house smoked salmon and wild maine blueberry pancakes with warm maple butter. Everything came out pretty quickly and was absolutely delicious. I had a bite of each of my roommates' entrees in addition to eating half of mine (had to take the other half to go since I was so full).While I'm not a fan of smoked salmon for breakfast, the crispy potato pancake was still delicious and served hot with the perfect amount of crunch. The blueberry pancakes were also great--sweet, fluffy, and decadent with the blueberry topping, powdered sugar, and amazing maple butter. The fried chicken and waffles were hands down the best dish out of the three and the best I've ever had. While other restaurants typically serve fried chicken on the bone, the fried chicken here was boneless, flavorful, and covered in a delicious glaze. Adding the warm maple butter and fluffy waffle completed the dish.I ate my leftovers the next day at work and all of my coworkers were commenting on how delicious it smelled. Head over to this place for the fried chicken and waffles and you won't regret it. Great food! Definitely recommended. Wait is really long though so go early. We came here for an early dinner since tales of their brunch line was too formidable for us to attempt. Even so, a line had already formed outside and soon it was a full house inside. Food was good, not amazing, and service was mediocre. I had the Sugar Bacon Burger with sweet potato fries, and we shared an order of the Blueberry Pancake that came with their divine maple butter. The burger was pretty basic, but the sugar bacon was extraordinary, thick-cut and beautifully caramelized. The pancakes were fluffy because of whipped egg whites folded into the batter, but surprisingly bland. They really needed the butter syrup to heighten their taste. Use it wisely because extra butter will cost you, and then the blandness of the pancake starts to peek through.Overall a novelty to try once, and the LES lends a lot to explore afterwards, but I probably won't visit them again due to brunch/dinner lines and quality factor. 3.5 StarsI don't know what to think of this place with all the high reviews, so I had to check it out myself. I was craving pancakes and therefore I got myself the pancakes with warm maple butter and banana walnut ($15). I personally thought it was okay and not the best I ever had. I think I'm too spoiled with SF brunch scene that this place just doesn't cut it. As for service, it was okay at times and other time we had to waive them down. I ended up not finishing my pancakes and some random guy looking in from the window was starring at my pancakes so I nodded my head for approval and he came right into the restaurant to get it. Tehehehe **CASH ONLY**Okay, now I may continue my review. My friend was craving fried chicken and waffles while I craved normal brunch food, I decided to bring her here to the famous Clinton St. Baking Co. I ordered the Country Breakfast, I opted for the bacon instead of the ham and the toast instead of the biscuit and my friend had the ginormous chicken and waffle dish. I was so pleased with my dish, the scrambled eggs was delicious, bacon was perfectly crispy, the hash was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, a pretty solid dish in my opinion. My friend really enjoyed the chicken and waffle as well. Overall, I'll definitely recommend this place to friends, but only for small groups because let's be honest, who carries that much cash to pay for a group of 5? Anyways, this place is worth the hype and the insane lines during the weekend. Finally made it to the infamous Clinton Street Baking Company for brunch! (...after a 1.5 hour wait, obviously) They are present on the NoWait app, which allows you to virtually get in line as long as you're within a 1 mile radius of the premises. Unfortunately, it said Clinton had a ""special event"" the day I went and wouldn't let me reserve a spot. Didn't notice anything special event related when I got to the restaurant to put my name down though. My friend and I ordered blueberry pancakes and the southern breakfast. The pancakes are as good as everyone says they are--light and fluffy. The maple butter it came with was AMAZING. I heard multiple comments around me about how people wanted to drink it with a straw, and I would totally agree with that sentiment if I wasn't worried about the caloric intake. The blueberries were also flavorful without being overwhelmingly sweet!I liked the southern breakfast as well. It came with two eggs (I got them over easy), cheese grits, and sugar cured bacon. The portions seemed slightly disproportionate. The amount of bacon given seemed excessive for the amount of grits I got (I know, you can never have too much bacon, what is this blasphemy). In this case, I actually really liked the bacon but if you eat too many in a row, it gets a little sweet. I personally liked ""chasing"" it with a spoonful of grits or eggs, but I ran out with around a few chunks of bacon to spare. With that said, I did greatly enjoy all the components regardless. The fried green tomatoes were amazing and were gone almost immediately.Overall, it was definitely worth the experience! I'm not sure if I would go out of my way to wait that long again, but if I was in the area and the wait time was shorter, I would definitely swing by. Cash only. This place was packed on a normal workday morning. It was about 30 minutes wait time. Space was very tight. Someone almost knocked down my silverware with her jacket without apologizing. Maybe it would be better to visit here in the warmer weather seasons. The service was average. It took a long time for the food to be served, at least 40 minutes. For a highly rated and super busy restaurant, I would expect less or no mistakes from the wait staff. However, I asked for the blueberry sauce on the side of the pancakes when the food came out, the sauce was on top. The wait staff did apologize after and I got a new plate of pancakes with sauce on the side. The first table to the left of ours had to wait for a long time to get their changes. Oh right, this place was cash only, which was a huge drawback. If the guy didn't ask for it, they might never get it back. I got the most famous blueberry pancakes. It was pretty fluffy, sweet and not overwhelmed with baking soda. I still think the pancakes from Tops Diner in New Jersey is the best pancakes that I have ever had. I was glad for asking to have blueberry sauce on the side. The sauce was too sweet. The warm maple butter was definitely a huge plus for the pancakes. It was warm, sweet (yes, it was very sweet and I could only have a little bit) and flavorful.My husband had chicken &amp; waffles. The chicken was well seasoned and crispy but waffles were pretty dry and plain. Filled with my fellow Jews on Christmas weekend, and they're holding it down! Some points I don't think other reviews mention:- Download the Nowait app as soon as you're within a mile, and put your name down. My wait was barely twenty minutes on a Sunday morning. It's very very easy and makes coming here a breeze. The host is busy, but she looks out for everyone. - Clinton St Omelette with spinach and mushrooms was awesome. The potatoes are great, too. Perfectly soft, but not mushy at all. - blueberry pancakes are among the best pancakes I've ever had. The maple syrup house sauce it comes with is unlike any other sauce. - coffee was not bitter, but delicious. All sorts of milk available, including almond. Tried the mimosa with the blackberry puree and thought it was delicious as well. - great for families and dates. I wouldn't come here with a group, unless you have a reservation.To conclude, this place brunches, and it brunches well. There were afew positive elements from this restaurant and a couple not so positive . The positives are that this restaurant has great workers . It's evident by their hustle and their politeness. Another positive was the fact that they give great tasting biscuits before your meal and I was able to get some for the road as well . They comped my disgusting salmon entree . Their pancakes which I saw a lot of people getting smelled amazing and looked delish .The chicken wings were reallyyyy good .The negatives : The salmon entree was likely the worst salmon I have ever eaten . Before I could even get a bite in I was overwhelmed with a strong disgustingly fishy scent sorta like the scent you get when you are in the Whole Foods fish section. I initially overlooked it because of the crispy skin it had and i squeezed the accompanying lemon on it to cut the scent . That helped 0 percent . The fish was not cooked all the way through unsurprisingly and I was only able to get two bites in . Fortunately , I was able to sample my partner's chicken and waffles entree which was better but not stellar for me to bump them to a 4 star rating . The wait times for everything is ridiculous . For the wings , it took about 30 minutes to arrive and just as long for the entrees . It was not swarmed pack which is worrying if it eventually were to be . You can get unlimited biscuits but man can't live on biscuits alone . Overall this place is a solid 3 stars . Refrain from their salmon entree and eat breakfast foods and you should be A-ok . A place with so many positive reviews is going to be busy right? Well good thing we accounted for it before coming here. We allowed ample wait time and went during off hours to avoid long wait times. Our plan worked and we only had a relatively short wait. We were seated by the window which was nice. Our server was prompt at getting us menus and taking our drink orders when we sat. She was patient with us as we looked through the menu to make our selection. With how busy this place is, above average customer service.Mink ordered the Pancakes with Warm Maple Butter and I ordered the Fried Chicken &amp; Waffles with a Clinton St. Bloody Mary to wash it down. Our drinks didn't take long to arrive. While we waited for our food, the place filled up fast and a line formed to dine here. Talk about good timing right? Our server got our order into the kitchen before the rush so we got our food quickly. The portions were HUGE! Mink's pancakes were very fluffy. My chicken was very moist and tasty. The waffle was soft and just paired perfectly with the chicken. There was also this red and greed hot sauce that I added to every bite of my meal. This place didn't disappoint and I see why they are so highly rated. Came here on a late Sunday morning. Generally, I always see a crazy long line here so I was happy to see that I lucked out and we only had a quick 20 minute wait. It must have been a weird gap in between crazy wait times because soon after we were seated the line started building again. (Yay for luck!)The first time I ever came here was for brunch in 2015 with a bunch of friends as we were planning the bridal shower and bachelorette for another friend. It was in an older restaurant. I think since then, they renovated the place and made it larger because I didn't remember it being located on a corner before. It was much more spacious and the large windows allowed a lot of light to come in. I had the Southern Breakfast with two fried eggs, sugar cured bacon, cheese grits, fried green tomatoes... I LOVE fried green tomatoes and these were done perfectly crunchy. The cheese grits were cheesy but not overwhelmingly so and the bacon was thick and felt filling. I also had the watermelon lemonade which was light and refreshing. Despite how packed the restaurant became soon after our order was taken, I still felt like the staff was really good at being attentive and making sure that we got the extra ketchup and hot sauce we asked for. All in all, a good place to brunch if you don't mind the wait times. Clinton Street Baking never disappoints! I bring all of my visiting family and friends here for brunch (weekdays only because it gets packed &amp; the wait time can be ridiculous). This has actually been my birthday breakfast treat for a number of people. My favorite meal is the chicken &amp; waffles but all the pancakes I've tried are delicious. Mind you, I don't even like pancakes. When they have the soft shell crab special, please order it. You won't regret it!In terms of beating the wait time, arrive early! The usual brunch times (11am-1pm) are super busy and you will wait a long time. Since it was my first time, I decided to be basic and get the two most popular dishes I saw on Yelp photos: Fried Chicken and Waffles and Wild Maine Blueberry Pancakes with Warm Maple Butter. Food: Both dishes came pretty quick and were both served with maple syrup! Fried chicken with maple syrup was a weird combination for me but it worked and tasted great! Although I would still rather prefer it with the Tabasco/red sauce they offer! What I love about the waffles was how surprisingly easy it was for me to knife through it! The taste of both the chicken breast with waffles was so flavorful and worked so well together! 5/5: I just found my favorite brunch dish here! The Fried Chicken Waffles were so good, it made the Blueberry pancakes look bad! Usually, I prefer sweet dishes but, to be honest, the pancakes were nothing special for the price! It does have a very buttery, pan-fried taste to it though. What stood out was the maple syrup which complemented well with the pancakes! 4/5!Interior: The overall location felt like a diner. It was packed but not too packed on a Wednesday afternoon. I really enjoyed the lighting given off from the big windows! Service: They were really attentive. A little bit too much to my liking. I know I take forever ordering but they legit came over to me like 3 times to take my order.Remember this place is cash only!!!!! Luckily, there is an ATM across the street if anything. If I had the money, I would definitely come back to try the other dishes they have! Since writing this review, I've finally gotten the chance to dine at the main restaurant, and one secret I've discovered is to go for dinner! That's right, though this place is a madhouse for weekend brunch, it's actually very chill for dinner, and they still offer their famous blueberry pancakes.I'm still partial to stopping by the bakery annex next door over waiting for a table if it's in the morning. My all-time favorite is their triple berry scone, though the chocolate chip and the goat cheese scones are also excellent. In my opinion, their scones far surpass their muffins. Thought those two new nuggets of info were worth an update. Enjoy! For me to give a 2 star rating, it means I regret going there. As a NY tourist, I was told that the blueberry pancakes here were super good. I got there and was seated immediately at the counter since I was a party of 1. Parties of 2+ were looking at a 1.5 hour wait though.The waitress at the bar gave me a menu and took my order which was fine. But the wait for the pancakes after that was a whomping 45 minutes. I could see the guy making the pancakes too, and was left wondering which one would be mine. When I was finally served the pancakes, they were indeed good. But some of it was undercooked.. also, at $15 for 3 pancakes.. no sides.. that is pretty steep.Things to note:Cash ONLY. This was a bummer since I didn't realize this was the case... and I didn't realize until 30 minutes into my waiting.. They really should make it more clear on their menus that it's cash only. the waitress told me there was an ATM across the street but I chose to walk the 10 minutes to Whole Foods (to make a purchase and get cash back) and 10 minutes back instead of paying for the ATM fees.. because after the ATM fees, my breakfast of just 3 pancakes would have cost me $28 after tax and tip..heck no, I'll walk the 20 minutes. All in all, long wait after ordering, undercooked pancakes, and overpriced food, I left wanting more. This was not worth my time or stomach space tbh. Even though it was hard to find this place (how are you supposed to know what street it's on?!), it was well worth the adventure. The first thing you'll notice is that there's a line, which means that there's some combination of great food and insufficient seating, which is an excellent start. When we went they gave us some sample pancakes, and honestly it was worth the trip just for that. You know how pancakes are fluffy and light and sweet and delicious and make you consider how infrequently you eat pancakes and how maybe you should eat them more? These guys definitely made me reconsider my dietary habits, which is the best compliment you can give a restaurant I think. Eventually we got seated, and since they're famous for pancakes and I had just had my world changed, I ordered the eggs Benedict. My dining buddy got the pancakes, because she's sane, and she got the blueberry version, because she's healthy, and they came with maple butter, because screw that, you're having pancakes, not salad. They were glorious. Buttery, fluffy, sweet, I almost cried when they were gone, etc. You know, the usual. The eggs Benedict were also probably the best in the city, so I guess I didn't mess up too badly in my portion of the shared meal. It came with salmon and the egg was great, and it was an overall awesome dish. But yea, pancakes are the move for sure if you don't get to split two meals. Definitely worth a visit! Fantastic. Ugh I can't get over how delicious and filling this place was. I read previous reviews of how packed this place could get so I planned on arriving close to opening time, despite it being a Monday. When I got there around 930, the place was already packed with people already waiting. My group of 6 was quoted a time of 20 min, which was not awful at all. I gave my number to the hostess and she said they'd text me when my table was next to be cleared so my party had ample time to be there. They won't sit you without a complete party so plan ahead! The hostess suggested that we could wait at their bakery next door and grab some drinks there. Two of us ordered their drinks before I received my text saying my table was ready! 10 min wait yasssOur orders: - regular Benedict and a side of fruit - salmon Benedict with a side of hash browns- chorizo scramble with a side of fried chicken- buttermilk biscuit sandwich- southern breakfast- country breakfast- stack of blueberry pancakes for the tableOur eyes may have been bigger than our stomachs once we saw how much food we actually ordered lol. But everyone was more than satisfied with their order! My regular Benedict was so flavorful and the eggs were poached perfectly. I tried a bite of the buttermilk biscuit and it was buttery and flaky. The fried chicken had a great coating on it and it was amazing. If I'm every back in town, I'm ordering the chicken and waffles lol. The pancakes were so fluffy but very filling! I could only eat a couple bites. Eat it with the warm maple butter that is served alongside! They're cash only so bring tons because you're gonna want everything. We definitely would've waited longer for the food because it was that worth it. Would recommend 1000%! While the wait to get into this place is pretty intense during peak brunch hours, I think the food is worth it! Most decent brunch spots in NYC will have an outrageous wait anyway. The challenge is striking a balance between not coming here starving, but also being ready to consume a large amount of food. I've been here twice, and both times, the food was fabulous! I'm usually not too crazy about pancakes, but the ones here were fantastic. Did they secretly slip in some addictive substances? (Maybe in the incredible maple butter sauce that comes with the pancakes?) Their chicken and waffle was also amazing. Both fried chicken and Belgian waffle had the perfect texture, and there was a generous amount of both, along with the same addictive maple butter sauce that comes with the pancakes. Service was not remarkable, but not bad, and I was way too busy focusing on the food to mind. I will definitely be back! The wait is forever and a day BUT totally worth it. Love their chicken &amp; waffles and Potato latkes w/ salmon! I haven't tried their pancakes or French toast yet but heard they were a must! 2 tips ;; CASH ONLY &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;download NOWAIT App and line up on the app and when you're closer they will text you to check in so you do not need to wait in the cold or heat forever",https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MQCtW6gKU1FxFfa0ebOXmA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_NdA8fDnsPM3rNAjN1JEMg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TqQ76XkoPta66KkwcwIZSg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0WH6srq5Z74vI0jIXMkrzg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4rYt6c5r_ki1U2aaM_Sxmw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3FpKpRXs6hiaCorWAxCpgw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FFgPPNTCNdrmodFse7tGgg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LxDQHXHd1Zb7MqGbES0MPw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/D9bubU4DamsW7CMgTuhT2A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/k4E7r3fME85-5zTvp9NE2g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7-nkHJAzvRID7tlOvNHKyg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MvwgZWYV2QTL_uBuoC1uEw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zBUPfww_JVVtQsx3O6vDFQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Kl0fKdgtbNM1fn3scjSpTw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zdih5TK1sMAKZhdGMz_49w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tGOj5U1mSfsSBpUVHcnocA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YN-FqRJJJ84k793xI0qu7A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2K0vZLJYNQkQqvHRC64nMw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lupg3M-H9baS8bQ6TQFUqw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mhTxuaHWcpGovLhb8qtH-Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bswZVzgDBaVdENpS0NDAPA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AJ_yu1RMEMuiro1AfIz2-Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_hbcEMYTUWETHn7prxABfw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OA5qwHy7-etRGvEDbDW4QA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7kBK5ySzTz9-28h8srHh8w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tsTwferKuvceLT9M_xPkpg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cgXkuUS6Dyk7NFO4EmaVHg/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/cocoron-new-york-2,cocoron-new-york-2,New York,10002,NY,Japanese,Noodles,Soup,"There are two Cocoron locations just a couple blocks from each other. Not sure about the one on Delancey, but this one on Kenmare is quite small and toasty. My first time trying soba noodles and I'm glad we chose Cocoron!I had the Japanese Curry with Sliced Pork Dip Soba, and the cold noodles on the side tasted really fresh, which complemented the boiling hot curry really well. The flavor was just right.My boyfriend got the Sliced Pork with Kimchi Warm Soba. Surprisingly, it tasted somewhat sweet. Overall, we had a good time and would recommend this place to others. The staff was attentive and the prices aren't expensive!NOTE: Cash only! We arrived at the restaurant at about 1:30 pm on Saturday. There were not many people at that time. I and my friend chose the seats at the bar and ordered two small size sets of dip soba. The ambience is nice and intimate. The dip soba we ordered presented as a pot of soup and a basket of soba. The waiter would then light up the fire under the pot, keeping the soup warm enough during eating. The dip soba we ordered were the Mera Mera Dip Soba and the Chicken Meatball Dip Soba. The soup of the Mera Mera is a little spicy and a little hotter than the other one when the fire is on. The taste is much heavier than the other one, too. Except for a little minced meat, there is no other things to eat in this soup. The taste of the Chicken Meatball soup is lighter. The meatballs and the vegetable with the sauce soup taste good. The soba is average. The portion of the soba is too small with the small size. I came here after eating 3 pudding cakes, but I could eat more other things after the soba. I think the ingredients in the soup is not enough with the price of $15.5, especially the Mera Mera. I had expected there would be more meat and vegetables. The fire under the pot was on long enough for my meal. Maybe next time will try its cold soba. Anyway, it's affordable but with not enough portion. such a great noodle place!  great place to warm up during a cold winter season.my brother and i came in for lunch on a cold and windy nyc sunday afternoon and were seated immediately. however, we must've beat the lunch rush bc everyone after us had to wait for a seat. We both ordered the dip sobas, which were SO GOOD. I ordered the spicy one which honestly wasn't that spicy! for someone that has no spice tolerance it wasn't that bad (it was more like on the hotter mild side). so what happens is the food comes out with a soup bowl and a noodle basket. the noodles are dry in the noodle basket. and what you're supposed to do is take the noodles and ""dip"" them into the soup bowl to flavor and then eat. Then near the end of your meal, they'll bring you a small teapot with broth where you're supposed to pour into your soup base to make it less concentrated and more like a real soup thing so you can drink it. I didnt know that, so i had already started drinking the concentrated soup anyway during my meal (and thought it was kind of salty but maybe im just super sensitive to salt which i am anyway). haha i am an idiot.Anyway, great experience and i loved the food! high quality food and great service. they're quick and friendly here! a must stop if you like noodles / japanese food / high quality food! PROTIP: cash onlyPROTIP: they also have cold soba for the hotter summer months Good casual soba spot that will hit the spot.  There's a very extensive selection of hot and cold sobas / soup and dipping options; possibly too many, actually, as it's hard to figure out what you want.  There's also a number of different appetizers you can try.Most recently, I tried the mera mera hot soba, mentai mochi spring rolls, and steamed chicken meatballs covered with sticky rice.  Everything was good.  I was most excited to try the spring rolls because I love mochi and have never had mochi in spring rolls before, and that was a good dish, although there was barely any mentai (cod roe).  Overall everything was tasty though.  May not be your highest quality food, but I don't think it will disappoint either. The best soba I've ever tasted. Always very consistent texture and the kimchi pork soup was always perfect!!!  Staffs are so polite and sweet.  Very cute little place.  Must go early otherwise, long wait. I tend to like this location more, because it tends to not be as busy as the Delancey location. I wrote a review for the Delancey location, but I felt the need to write a new review. My wife and I just got back from Japan. We were excited to try food right from the source. We had friends recommend a great Soba place in Hakone, a mile from the train station. We hiked in the rain and found this little wooden table and watched the river pass as we had delicious dip soba. But you know what? We both left thinking that it was just as good as Cocoron. I have a new appreciation for Cocoron. Had a tough time finding this place because it looks abandoned from the outside, luckily it wasn't! The hours are a little odd, and it was packed when we came even though it was only 30 min after they opened for lunch. The menu has lots of good choices even for a restrictive diet, so that's exciting. I got the warm curry soba noodles with beef, and it was delicious! It's a little unfortunate that it's cash only, that's a little limiting, but if definitely be back to try the rest of the menu! I also very much enjoyed the little cup of tea they give you at the end of the meal. This is the first place I've been to with dipping soba! I got their ""MERA, MERA Dip Soba"" because I'm a spicy lover. It has ""Homemade SOBA noodle w/ Bonito flakes and spicy sesame based soup, Mincheed chicken, Bean Sprout, Bok choy, Scallion, Sesame, Sesame chill oil.""I got the small which was a pretty good amount. The dipping sauce was super rich in flavor, almost like a concentrated ramen broth. I loved the combination of the cold soba noodles with the hot, spicy dip!They also gave us some broth later on to dilute the sauce into more of a soup, which was great. I drank EVERYTHING. haha They give you hot tea afterwards which was also nice. My only qualm was that the food did take a while to come out but other than that, great!**Cash only!** This place is excellent. I didn't even realize I loved soba noodles so much until I came here! It was easy to get a table, even on a Saturday night, and service was very efficient. The menu is a bit overwhelming. I had one of the warm soba noodles and my fianc had one of the dipped noodles. Both were excellent. I added some chili oil to make mine spicer and It perfectly hit the spot. The prices are fairly reasonable and the portions quite large. It's only an extra dollar or two to make yours even larger but I definitely didn't need that. The appetizers look amazing too and I would love to try those on future visits. This place is unique and absolutely delicious. I'll definitely be back to one of their locations! I never had soba before so I was a bit hesitant at first. After trying the stamina soba, I fell in love! I definitely will come back to try the other slabs! The food here is worth a 4 but I had to give this place a 2 because of their poor services.  The waitress are okay, but the busboy, I don't even know where to begin!  They hovered over us the whole time and it was not that busy that they had to rush us out.First off, when we asked for how much it would cost for extra noodles for my brother, we were informed it would cost $6.  Which is really expensive for just some extra noodles.  While the small and large is only $1 difference.  If I knew that, then we should have just ordered the large.  Then it took them maybe 10 minutes to get our beer.  It really doesn't take that long and they also forgot to bring us spoons and light the fire for sterno that keeps the soup hot.  Those are minor things that I can get over but then things started to get worst . While I was still eating there, one busboy would ask if we wanted the check.  Um...clearly I was still eating but my brother was nice to just take the check as I finished my soup.  After he came back with the check, and as I was still eating he asked if I was done and was ready to take my dish away.  Lastly he hovered over us to check if we paid our check.  We were maybe there only for half an hour for the whole meal.  There was no need to rush us out, I understand if they had 10 people waiting for a table maybe but even then I don't think we should have been treated that way! Finally get to try out Cocoron as I came earlier this time. Normally when I get off work at 7, it is packed with a long wait time. So how exciting to try a restaurant with a speciality of Soba! Even though put in a small tight seating space, the atmosphere still okay as the food is what matters the most. So we had order the Cocoron's original fried chicken and Soba no Kabayaki as appetizer. We were told that the Cocoron's original fried chicken will come later on as it takes more time to be prepped. I ordered the warm kim chee soba and it tasted not bad but after eating awhile I was tired of the taste. It is probably because I normally don't like a strong soup base. I did also like the Cocoron's original fried chicken which had seasoning inside the the breading as well as out. The soba no kabayaki was so so.Overall, The downside I had was after the meal me and my boyfriend got a stomach ache which is kind of yours the downside since I though the meal was not bad. I would want to give this place another chance and I wouldn't mind coming back to try something different, hopeful before the rush hour. I love noodles. Cocoron's Japanese soba is chewy and perfect for all types of soups. Cocoron is definitely not the traditional Japanese soba shop. Make no mistake. They do a great job staying in the roots which is making good noodles. Great selection of the cold, hot, and fusion soba soup. Must try. What you need to know: - Soba shop with an extensive menu of appetizers, hot, cold, dipping and vegan options - Shockingly impressive menu for vegans and vegetarians - Cash only! What we ordered: - Cold kimchi soba (price for small $13) - perfectly cooked bouncy and earthy soba noodles with finely sliced cucumbers, apples and nori. At first glance, I was expecting a dry dish since it's just cold soba noodles, kimchi, toppings and a poached egg on the side, but once you mix it all up, there is this amazing mildly spicy and savory sauce that coats everything. It was surprisingly good!!! Definitely will get the large size next time, as I felt hungry a few hours later. - Vegan warm sansei soba (small for $14) - the broth is kombu kelp seaweed based but had a very familiar taste to bonito based dashi broths! The soba was topped with an array of vegetables (bamboo shoots, mushrooms, scallions, etc) and kitsune (fried tofu). It was so delicious that I may get this next time! Cocoron was the first soba shop I visited in New York 3 years ago. The hearty and flavorful broth is still so memorable today. Upon deciding to get soba dinner, I immediately proposed Cocoron. Located at the boarder of LES, Soho, and Chinatown, Cocoron offer good value soba meals. They also expanded to a new location 1 block away from the original one.Highly recommend getting the dipping soba! It's fun and delicious. Soup is heated in a small pot and you dip the soba into the soup before eating it.Overall, good and hearty soba. Worth a visit.Note: cash only. I have been looking forward to a delicious ramen substitute since giving up on red meat and pork - and this place is IT!We went for lunch on Sunday afternoon around 1pm; the restaurant was full, but not on a wait. I drink water like a camel - and the waitstaff was constantly refilling my glass - and it was appreciated! They are a team waitstaff and they were prompt and friendly.I ordered the Vegan Meera Meera Soba Soup and my partner got the pork soba dip. My vegan dish was soooo rich - like stick to your ribs rich! However, when you get the soup - you need to eat fast because the noodles get soggy (because they are buckwheat). I think the dip might have been the way to go - but the soup was still wayyyyy delicious. My partners noodles were fresh and bouncey and he said his broth had amazing flavor.We also really enjoyed the Red Cabbage Kimchi!Overall - I can't wait to come back to try the Vegan Soba Meera Meera Dip! Went here with a friend to check out one of the acclaimed dipping sobas.Was this the best soba I've ever had? No. But the experience and the ritual of eating it made it quite enjoyable. It takes a bit of getting used to, but with some practice and guidance from the wait staff we were able to partake in this specialty.Overall, the soba was good and was very reasonably priced. I was a little annoyed at the lack of space as I was constantly bumped into during my meal, but otherwise the wait staff was perfectly friendly and attentive. Definitely worth checking out for a unique dining experience. So good! Lots of options to choose from &amp; best thing about it is that I don't feel guilty for stuffing my face when it's soba. I much more prefer this place over any ramen joint. Sooooo delicious!!!! I have to admit, this place was great. The food was what I was hoping for but the restaurant is on the small/cramped side and there was a constant lingering feeling that they are trying to get you in and out as quick as possible. The one thing I didn't care for were the seats, the seats were like bar stools and weren't very comfortable. Overall, a good place to get solid soba but don't expect to stay too that long because it is uncomfortable or because they are trying to get rid of you.The food:Kamo no Roast- Slow roasted duck after marinated with homemade soy sauce, blueberry sauce on the side. The duck was pretty good, it had a nice smoky flavor and the meat was nice and tender but I was surprised the duck itself didn't have much flavor. I also thought the dish was expensive for what it was. I also wish the duck skin had some type of texture to it. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=dxNEaJz5nyjwxc7rnQlMlg&amp;userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlAMera Mera Dip Soba- Cold soba w/ Bok Choy, chili powder, garlic, ginger, minced chicken, scallion, sesame. I thought this was great. The idea of DIY soba was a lot of fun and I thought the flavoring of it it was good. I think this is worth trying but it does come off salty and a bit sweet but still worth a try. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=WHUbVYjKIPaWw7wr-xRcDw&amp;userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlAChicken Meatball Dip Soba- Cold soba w/ Burdock, chicken meatball, scallion, shitake mushroom. I think the dip sobas are the way to go. I really enjoyed the chicken meatballs and they give 5 meatballs which is a good amount. I think this is worth getting as well, but I thought the broth was a tad too sweet. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=TFNX8lXQUj8C4a9-SsLHKw&amp;userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA Delicious Japanese food. There soba noodles are great. This restaurant is good at making vegan/meat lover noodles but not the one that is in the between (maybe i have visited it too little). One star off because it does NOT ACCEPT CARDS. cash only, which is a bit inconvenient.",https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Dr_8cvheaRyHB1qFxl6I4w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2fjLFFqDrB8MKOzWfaBiVg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MENXDwHe0U4a_e0ZbiTkdA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IlghfWvend8fArNFZXIcCA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8RH1ryFkapco5ulGmSxTPQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/eZPz8_o2XHAYg7bAqXXhDQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dxNEaJz5nyjwxc7rnQlMlg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WHUbVYjKIPaWw7wr-xRcDw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TFNX8lXQUj8C4a9-SsLHKw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9WVOG4Tv3mHI9duBgq2rFw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/i0cwTuV-hlEkvrJ3mKsiug/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1WYDQYl015WrOo7LGp6FxQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KQwYmmMeMgA3mdPERCzhig/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ArmHduHh1Zg4wkyV0LXRAw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xcv0tK4gooFgdf8bEd2UMw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DtH2wmvl9OUFPQ3eKGE2Yg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QMS999_4VAbtUVwf3l_I-Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kd1vxGuLC1BvBO-fe6zhkA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uIzy_TItmZng1sA_jVvwDQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OgD4mhHXZ2xc65umicUCwQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rJjwSz8V4YZZcrTt4OZZ8Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qJxA5ZB45hbUf1QwaMewSA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/aFxQ9w6SNxF1PjzJeok4ng/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/usar25TnpzhzhpNY1KFrUg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7lVGcdahhC1dDf3n9vFVDA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/M8BY3tYcEvI4MoCKb5oSWA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wYp10DUwf7QrPaVL6nuyAg/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/cocoron-new-york-3,cocoron-new-york-3,New York,10002,NY,Japanese,Noodles,Vegan,"This is my favorite soba spot in NYC for an affordable price. I usually get the Pork Kimchi Dip Soba (small $14.5) and it's perfect for a cold winter day. The broth is sweet spicy and full of flavor - just the way I like it. My mom always gets the Warm Buta Hakusai Soba (small $15) and it's perfect for revitalizing your body. It comes with sliced pork, hakusai (chinese cabbage), grated fresh daikon radish, ginger, watercress, nori, and bonito flakes. The portions are enough to fill me but not to the point where I'm super full. If you're very hungry, I would suggest getting the large. There are also different toppings you can get for extra $. I decided to get watercress (+$1). There wasn't much but then again, it's only a dollar. At the end of your meal, they give you a cup of tea which was nice. I'm certainly a fan of this place and I'll be back again! The dip soba is just so perfect for a cold winter! The soba and the broth are separated so that the soba will not be too mushy. I ordered the Mera Mera dip soba. The broth has full flavor, quite thick, a little spicy, and more of a fusion style.My friend ordered the Chicken Meatball dip soba, which I happened to like it more than their Top 1 Mera Mera. The broth is milder and thinner. You can taste more of the soy sauce and more of a traditional Japanese style. MY FAVORITE PLACE EVER. I always get two things:Soba no KaboyakiVegan mera mera dipDon't question it, just do it. I wish there was a Cocoron in Toronto because I would be a regular. Ever since I left Tokyo in 2012, I've been looking for a place to get high-quality soba. I'm originally from Toronto, so my search was pretty unsuccessful. Lo and behold, after a tiring day in Soho, we walked into Cocoron. I ordered the large pork kimchee dip soba while bf ordered the large cold buta shabu soba. The dip soba has much more visual impact upon arrival at your table and looks mouth-wateringly inviting. The soba noodles instantly triggered my nostalgia upon first bite. I was so happy to be reminded of how amazing soba noodles are. The broth was delicious, hearty, and well-seasoned. It is not spicy at all, despite how it looks. I highly recommend ordering the pork kimchee dip soba on a cold winter day to warm you up!My boyfriend also enjoyed his cold soba, but agreed that my dish was much better. Also, while $15 is steep for a meal, you will leave very full and satiated. Plus, I've noticed that $15 for dinner is the average in NYC. The quality of food is amazing, as is the service here.We wanted to come back here, but because there's so much to eat in NYC, we didn't have enough time. Bf also wanted to try their sister curry restaurant, so that will be on the itinerary next time. Cocoron is changing it up from all the ramen noodle places around coz they're all about soba. Hot soba, cold soba, dip soba. As soon as I heard they had a whole vegan menu I was sure to stop by.Important points to note: cash only, no reservations, no leftovers (they don't have containers), no takeout. Also, they have two locations within 200 feet of each other (because they're that popular) and a nearby curry focused restaurant called Goemon.If you're going for the first time you should try the signature dish, the mera mera dip soba. In my case I got the vegan version of this. It is essentially a serving of cold soba noodles (there are a few sizes) and a dish of broth that they light underneath. Then you can have all kinds of fun playing with your food and dipping the noodles in the broth. The broth gets quite hot/boiling after a while but cools down once the fire goes out.I was really impressed with the mera mera dish and how tasty it was. Often vegan/vegetarian versions of broth can be clear or tasteless. This one had many layers of flavor and was packed full of veg.I have been back a few times now and brought friends. I've tried a few of the other hot soba noodle dishes including those where they are more of all noodle soup. Although I've liked all of them the mera mera has definitely remained my favorite. I look forward to trying more of the cold soba dishes when summer comes around.The ambiance of the restaurant is casual, cozy and clean. I was happy with the service I received each time and the food/bills came fairly promptly. They can often get very busy at the peak of dinner time. As someone who had to (doctors orders) keep a gluten free diet, one of the things I miss the most is Japanese noodles, whether it be soba or ramen. So you can imagine my excitement when I found out this place offers gluten free soba meals with 48 hr advance notice!Fantastic noodles (great texture, even better than the gluten version), and very rich and tasty broth. I got the dipping noodles (both times) and drank up every last drop of the broth. The appetizers are very good as well, and I particularly liked the tofu and rice cake.  You can tell the ingredient used in the dishes are healthy and of great quality, which always make eating out that much better. The cabbage slaw was very good as well, though if you're hungry (like I was) you may need something a bit more filling.I got a chance to catch up with the staff there during my meal, and it sounds like they're trying to offer more heath conscious options and accommodate for dietary restrictions while keeping with the mantra a of amazingly delicious home cooked meals. I can't tell you just how much i appreciate that, and can't wait to come back again soon! ""I want casual Asian noodles that are delicious and filling but I don't want Pho or Ramen or Udon"". Cocoron is your answer.  Important discretion: CASH ONLY. I wanted to write ""fast"" but Cocoron on Delancey is anything but. We ordered at 8pm and they must have forgotten about us since our appetizer didn't come out until 45 mins later. The daikon mocho is surprisingly yummy (and sticky!). I recommend it!! It's like a turnip cake (at dim sum). The Mera Mera is what they're known but and thank goodness we ordered these. I had the Vegan Mera Mera and though it's marketed as ""healthy"" it's definitely fatty (from the sesame) but I guess I can give it to them that it's a healthier alternative than a McDonald's burger. The vegan was delicious but the original was better (and I think lighter IMO). It was packed on a Saturday night (8pm) but you might have more luck with the one on Kenmare. My dish was~$14 for a small. Note they serve large and small. I think small was fine but since I loved it I could have probably kept going with the large. Just please be faster / better with the service Cocoron! Otherwise you'd be a 5! Soba!! I'm so happy that my bf and I stumbled upon this restaurant while walking to a DIFFERENT restaurant we had in mind. We decided to eat here instead and it was such a good decision. This place is perfect for the cold weather. I got the warm mera mera soba and my bf got the mera mera dip soba. Both are kinda the same except the warm mera mera is soba in warm soup and the dip soba is a sauce where the soba is separate from the sauce. I HIGHLY recommend the dip soba because it was SO FREAKIN DELICIOUS! I was kinda jealous that I didn't choose to order that. Don't get me wrong, my warm soba was super tasty as well, but the dipping soba was way more flavorful and I kept on finding myself stealing some of my bfs soba sauce. The consistency in that was much more thicker since it's considered a ""sauce"" and not soup like mine. I loved the juicy spicy broth and the minced chicken on both of the items. Everything was on point. Both items definitely hit the spot and I can't wait to come back to New York to eat it again!*CASH ONLY* Cocoron is a great place to go to on a cold winter day. There are actually two branches that are about two or three blocks away from each other, so if one is busy, you can just go to the other. They specialize in soba and you have your options of hot, cold, and dipping soba. There are also plentiful vegan options. The first time I went, I got the Stamina Dip Soba, which has some chicken meatballs and pork. The soba comes cold on the side and you get a huge bowl of dipping sauce/broth. The sauce was very flavorful and warms you right up. I almost burned myself, but it was worth it! You can either get the soba in small or large, but I would recommend getting the large, since it was only $1 more. The second time I went, I got the Mera Mera Dipping Soba, which is their recommended spicy option. It was decently spicy at first, but not distractingly so. I would recommend both the Stamina and Mera Mera, depending on whether or not you want something spicy. Service was fast and attentive, and they give a small cup of tea at the end too. Make sure to bring cash as it's cash only. Awesome Japanese style curry dishes!! The service, presentation and dishes will have you craving more and planing your next visits picks. Food: I really enjoyed the soba ! I got the stamina soba which wasn't spicy. The beef and chicken in the broth was so delicious and juicy! The chicken meatball was interesting. My friend got Mera mera hot soba dip! That was too spicy for me. I love how it came cold and with a bowl of hot soup to dip in. It was chilly out so that combo was so wholesome and made me feel warm. Service: it was alright, the waitress was blank face serving but got our orders within 5-10 minute. She gave us tea at the end. The vibe wasn't like super welcoming like some Japanese ramen places where they yell ""welcome"" in Japanese. Price: I think for both bowls of soba it was around $26 pre tip tax. Vibe: cozy warm and on the darker side! Located: on Delancey, got off the J train and it was right there! This place is amazing!!Definitely worth the wait at anytime of the day. They do have two locations in walking distance of each other but they're both packed with a wait time that's about the same. Dont be fooled by the sign that says to visit their other location that has ""no wait"" because it's a bigger space. We ended up waiting the same amount of time at the ""bigger"" one. We got the mera mera dip soba and another one i forgot the name of but they both tasted really similar and delicious. We opted for the large size soba and ended up running out of broth to dip the noodle in midway. They provided us extra broth to mix in which definitely helped the extremely salty original broth but nonetheless tasty AF. i love salt but the soup broth itself was so rich i needed to cut the flavors with cups and cups of water until some regular refill broth came through. The presentation of the dish itself is very cute and aesthetic so if you're going to do it for your food blog or instagram or whatever, opt for the dip soba over the hot soba served in a single bowl. Will definitely be coming back here for s'more So good and cute food. First time here after hearing my friends talk about how good this place is. No regrets of course! First olac to try dip soba in blazing hot soup! We ordered :-Mera Mera Dip Soba ($13.5)-Warm Pork Kimchee Soba ($14)-Yokozuna Dip Soba (L: $15) -Japanese Style Curry Dip Soba with Pork: ($13.5) I ordered this since it was a must ! Such nice Curry flavor! Just be careful not to burn your tongue like I did! When the dishes came, they lit the little fire to keep the soup nice and hot. And you blow it out if you want the fire to stop So basically the way to eat it is, you dip the soba into the broth for a few seconds, then eat it. After you finish the soba, they give out hot water to pour onto your ""soup"" so you can drink it since it's pretty thick if not. After your meal, they serve you hot tea so it's a nice way to digest ! The faded fast food orange sherbet awning, with a cartoon face on it and the store windows annoyingly well posted with promotional health aspects of the menu betrays the sophisticated unpretension of Corcoran, with its, in Japanese style, plain dining room in light wood and communal seating.Despite the bad curb appeal, there was a small line to get in a few minutes before the doors opened for business at 5:30pm on a Saturday.  I gradually began being wooed by this place, and it all started with a curry soup with pork $13.  The broth was a little fatty, smooth, a little spicy, with a slight sour tang - it was exceptional.   Nice pieces of pork with egg and scallions. The fried chicken, $5, came last, as I was warned of the cook time.   It had a spicy crust and was served on the bone, and was perfectly prepared.Another quirk of this place, stated firmly on the menu, is that there is no take out, including to go orders.   That made me very full, as I wasn't going to waste one ounce of that soba.   The menu features a bunch of small items, Kim Chee $3, sauted spinach and other vegetable sides with the menu describing their each individual healing properties. Larger appetizers looked equally wonderful, including a savory mochi preparation topped with daikon. Toward the end of my meal this almost empty looking bodega space had transformed into a sophisticated and sleek dining room, and the place was full.The food is special here.I also like that I can get a $3 mini beer pour, it's perfect before going into work. Stumbled upon this place as I was walking around the neighborhood. They sell cold noodles and soup noodles. I loved the presentation of each dish served, very Instagram worthy. The only reason why I give it a 4 is because it's cash only, which threw me off since I wasn't carrying enough cash. A recommendation I can give to the owners is maybe to provide an ATM in the store? So people like me can have the option to take out more money and try more things on the menu ;) Food that's healthy and still tastes good!Feeling cold and slightly under-the-weather, I decided to come here for warm noodle soup. I'm usually partial towards soba, but the Mera Mera and Vegan Warm Sansai sobas I ordered really hit the spot. I believe the sobas are made from scratch, so the chewy texture is just right. The broths are also simple, light, but not bland.I'd love to try the cold sobas next time on a warm sunny day. Never had soba before this but I'd have to say this was SOBA-YUM. I've always walked pass this small spot in LES but I've never gotten to try it, but this is definitely one of my goto spots in the area to grab food. They have a wide variety of soba noodles weather its cold, hot, or dip soba. I tried the Mera Mera dip soba since I didn't know what to get and it was the most popular dip soba on the menu. The soba noodles were fresh and tasty. The broth itself was filled with flavor. It was so comforting to eat on a cold day!! If you're someone who takes forever like me to eat, make sure to not be on your phone too much when eating your noodles otherwise the soba will get soggy LOL. Also one of the perks of the dip soba is that you can dip each bite in the broth before eating so that each bite will be to your liking and that the noodles won't have to sit in the broth the whole time for it to get soggy fast. One thing to note is that the restaurant is cash only so make sure you get cash before coming here! This is one of there newer locations and I cannot get enough of Cocoron. All the locations are convenient and close to my area of interest. I have went countless of times and always order the same items. The Homemade Tofu, Mera Mera Dip Soba (Hands down, the best one!), Chicken Meatballs. The service is usually great every time I go. They have a very interesting menu giving vegans, vegetarians etc. great options. My vegan best friend approves. They are about to create some gluten free dishes too. Definitely recommend it to my diet restricted friends. The Homemade Tofu is served with a side of bonito flakes, seaweed, scallion and ginger. I recommend trying to get each component into one bite. It could be hard since the little wooden spoon is the size of your nail. I prefer heavier flavors so I like to add a drop of soy sauce onto each bite. The Mera Mera Dip Soba has a flavorful kick to it and it's heavily seasoned and thick for you to dip your plain soba noodles into it. The soup will be too salty to drink until later when they give you hot water to dilute it into a filtered level. You may ask them to bring you the hot water to adjust to your liking. I also like adding additional vegetables to my broth.  The Chicken Meatballs takes a good 20 minutes and longer when it's busy. I always like eating this appetizer but it's sad that it always comes out after I finish my entire meal. I wished they'd have some new items for desserts though. I usually get the same desserts. The affogato is served with a small amount of green tea. The dessert is mostly corn flakes, homemade matcha ice-cream, mochi and sweet red beans. My favorite palette cleanser is the coconut milk is a bowl of coconut milk poured over frozen fruits such as berries, peaches, bananas and mint. CASH ONLY. Yummm! I've never been a huge fan of soba, but that has changed after coming to Corcoron. We came for lunch around 12pm on a Saturday and had no problem getting a table for 3. I'm a fan of spicy food, so I was pretty sad to hear that they didn't have mera mera broth that day. We all ended up ordering the pork kimchee dip soba and all loved it! The soba comes cold to dip into sizzling hot broth that has pieces of kimchee and thinly sliced pork. The broth itself had a slightly sweet kimchee flavor which I enjoyed and the small portion was pretty filling. Will definitely be back to try the mera mera broth  also just FYI the restaurant is cash only. We came here on a Wed night around 6:30. The restaurant is a little bit on the small size but we were able to get a table pretty quickly.We ended up getting the summer specials. One with beef and the other one with eel. Its served with a serving of soba noodles, a small dish with the protein, seaweed and other toppings and a little cup of sauce that you pour into the topping dish. It was pretty good when you mixed it together though the portion size is pretty small. There definitely could have been more meat since you dont get a lot. But the flavor was pretty good.",https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IkbHR5AhlnbpFUMZmNQNuQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/a8CdtsGv0fsFyaUj1rSGyQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qELPbKTO348xYecJ58Kcew/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kKsouy4Uf2wKxNQpLGqXXQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Mpo1cWg8ZWic8np2EQ-DiA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ddIRbKx-V6FjwuFRSrn4eQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qc6Rl3iKi5dOPj-bzfhAfg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LXYpeCFrS6fxbA4_J4CQQw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9K8HwiNyrbSzONgu31cwjg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-gQvhqu3dKAAlFcmtmkq_w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UnIZx3YFkrdpNTtE2lzNkw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tcVUX2FRa-1EJjx808AqmQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ppIugKzbnc6tgizy5NGeLg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XetsYYqIdza_9ScVPdMNPw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-ow3_ZD0ZEZN8R4wdt4Tsg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CrRMbgbyQV-wRsrLIbC9rw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yuRzDfnYhNJ10wgzL1JISA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Id-vJYk51ZyicTfyf_1SWQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GU1V-MSBF5hkNmmli0a1gw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/psitUib1kn_gi_aqpuhBMw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Zs_COraRLKaMkOI0W9mH8g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mZSoUWMdrZM9Kez1QWQ7IQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NOdKd44n5PKNdMYO2eNZPQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NK-dqlCYBB6AkSBxIsKQ3w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RVpIzpnqOIE2tnDG7zInUQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ue2TnOLtFFBeHNOJvWrwhA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RYy_3kPcvDUimSSns8U_xg/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/coffee-project-new-york-new-york,coffee-project-new-york-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Coffee & Tea,NA,NA,"TLDR: There's a latte here that will get you the most Instagram likes you've ever had. And it's super delicious!______I came here for one reason and one reason only.... the Deconstructed latte.Granted. I don't know if I was a local if I'd be getting this every day, but as a tourist I sure as heck was going to.Starts with an espresso shot.Then milk...that's been pasteurized at a lower temp. It's weird to say one milk is better than any other, but this was the best milk I've ever had. Didn't even taste like milk that I've had before.Then the latte. They mentioned all the notes I'd taste but I just tasted a perfect latte hat was creamy.Also got a little round bite that was cakey and had custard inside. It was a delight to nibble on while I went on the journey of my latte.Overall they are using great coffee and obviously taking special care when crafting their drinks! Check them out! So like many others I went for the Deconstructed Latte and it was actually a lovely short experience. Dine in only so you'll have to find a spot. When the latte was brought out I received a short explanation and how you should be drinking (essentially left to right with seltzer to cleanse at the beginning and end). The service was quick and the baristas helpful in choosing between drink options. The drink: ($7) so I've never had the opportunity to drink the milk and espresso separately so it was interesting to get to the end where everything comes together. Definitely gives you an appreciation for how the flavors (pungent and strong espresso and smooth elegant milk) come together. The tiny wafer is actually delicious and such a pleasant compliment to the coffee's slight bitterness (in a good way!). The drink of course is a bit pricey but if you want to treat a friend to a cool time without spending a whole lunch affair definitely try it out! The place: It's a great place to catch up with a friend but since the space is small I'd suggest do it at a slower time. One of the things I hate about hanging around coffee shops is the coffee stench that lingers on your hair and clothes and it doesn't exist here!! Rejoice for all coffee smell haters (not sorry). Deconstructed latte: each part was delicious, but surprisingly, the milk is the most memorable for me, I would order it again, just for the milk. The espresso is nice too.Not really a coffee shop to study or work at. I think the place has two outlets total.Service was friendly. Coffee Project continues to be the greatest gem in Noho/East Village for a great cup of coffee. Sum and Kaleena are the nicest owners and their passion for their ""project"" (pun intended) is obvious whenever an opportunity presents itself to indulge them in a conversation about all things coffee. Project #1 is a must try for latte and coffee lovers. It is not everyday you are offered a beautiful presentation of a deconstructed latte which allows you to experience the full espresso taste when imbibing a milk-based coffee drink. Their nitro brew was the one of the first and best before all the other local spots started adding it to their own menus. Make sure you go early for the deconstructed latte as space is a premium. It is merely part of its charm.  Coffee Project is a coffee destination worth going out of your way to visit. Love this coffee shop!  Such unique drinks and cute interior.  It is very small inside so hopefully you are lucky to snag a seat because you do need a seat for the deconstructed latte.  The first time I just happen to stumble upon this place as I was exploring East Village by myself but after trying it, I knew I had to bring my other half of #teamalwayshangry to this spot. One of their specialties is a deconstructed latte.  It starts with a shot of espresso, warm milk, then the actual latte and it comes with sparkling water to cleanse the palette and a nice waffle cookie was a treat.  It is beautifully displayed in these lovely glasses on a tray.  After they serve you, they will take the time to take you through how you should enjoy this experience.  Shot of espresso first, then the milk, then the latte.  The shot of espresso is not that bitter and is very enjoyable.  But the milk, it is milk like you have not tasted before.  I feel like this is the kind of milk you need each nice to have a good night's rest.  Then you come to the latte, probably one of the best lattes you will have.  I don't know if it is the temperature or what but they really have perfected the art of it.  I wish I could start all my Saturdays or Sundays with that deconstructed latte as you just immerse yourself in the experience and enjoy coffee like you have never before.  Highly recommend! Amazing coffee! I do think the deconstructed latte is a bit unnecessary - the regular latte is awesome on its own - but it's definitely fun. Honestly worth it for the waffle cookie. Pastries are incredible, too; I loved the berry scone and almond croissant. They get some of their stuff from Roberta's so don't miss that sticky bun if you've never had it. Super friendly baristas and great service! WARNING: Not a coffee expert!However, Coffee Project is the kind of place that can be enjoyed by java newbies and connoisseurs alike. My friend who is an avid coffee drinker frequents the place, so I had to give it a try.The deconstructed latte (aka Project One) is an ingenious move, borrowing from the modernist fine dining playbook. As with most coffee drinks, a latte is a deceptively simple cocktail of espresso and steamed milk. This format forces the drinker to taste each ingredient almost like a wine tasting, searching for nutty notes among the bitter ones in the espresso and different hints of sweetness in the creamiest milk.As this ""third wave"" of coffee continues to bring quality coffee, it can be easy to get lost in the chaos. At any rate, I would beseech you not to overlook Coffee Project, as its innovative presentation and all-around charm make it stand out. I'm a big coffee drinker. Also a little stuck up when it comes to the type of coffee I drink too..but surprisingly I was not in the mood for getting coffee when I came to coffee project *gasp*I read some great things about a lot of the items on their menu, and wanted to give the hot chocolate a whirl. It was just that kind of day. Couldn't drink any more caffeine, you know?First off, the gentleman who made my drink was just lovely. The place itself is tiny, but on a rainy sunday afternoon there was actually a table open. Also had two or three counter seats for solo drinkers to come hang.I decided to take my hot chocolate to go, but I could see this place getting very crowded during popular times. So drum roll please...the hot chocolate was *pretty* good but definitely not the best I've had in NY. A solid choice if you want a nice dark chocolate drink, but no frill. Whipped cream. Anything. Simple, delicious, but don't think I would get again if I were to come back.Definitely coming back for a deconstructed latte. Looked amazing and I'm intrigued. Innovative and memorable coffee shop experience in NYC. We came here because we wanted to try the specialty drinks: deconstructed latte and the nitro brew (+/- cream).The coffees were made well and delicious. I enjoyed the nitro brew a lot, it was smooth and creamy. The deconstructed latte was an interesting concept, and I liked that it came with a crispy waffle. However the espresso and the latte themselves were pretty standard. The $7 price is fair given that this is not your usual coffee experience.Would recommend for someone who enjoys coffee and is looking for an out of the ordinary presentation. Love would be an understatement.New York City is blessed with an incessant amount of good coffee shops. My coffee taste buds are borderline numb, but Coffee Project has revived it back to life. I got the deconstructed latte ($7), which I think is an incredible concept. You get an espresso shot, a frothy milk, a latte (mix of the two), and sparkling water to help cleanse your palette. Don't worry, someone will walk you through what you're getting and what order they recommend you drinking it in. The espresso shot and milk were both great on its own, and the latte was really great as well. I just love that you can taste the individual components before tasting it mixed together, because you get three very different tastes. The service was also really great. There's not a ton of seating inside the shop, so getting a flight can become an issue if you go at a really busy time.I'll definitely be back to try the cold brew flight and their individual espresso drinks. My friend and I first stumbled upon this place without knowing how much others rave about it. People here are so welcoming and knowledgeable about the menu/coffee. Space is a little tight with only a few tables and some window countertop seating, but I've always managed to find a table as soon as I ordered my drink. Presentation of coffee is always beautiful, and the flavor is great as well--robust yet smooth. This is a perfect place to stop by for a mid-afternoon pick-me-up or to catch up with friends over a good cup of coffee. This place is awesome. The service was really great.Me and my girlfriend ordered the deconstructed latte and I ordered the chai latte and let me tells ya.I drink a lot of chai lalalalatte and I was like ""dude this was a bomb chai lalalalallaallalalalalatte.So I recommend that. It makes you go ""mm this good"" Coffee Project was the first place I stopped after taking a red eye from Las Vegas on a recent trip to NYC.  I had bookmarked it for its good reviews and especially to try the de-constructed latte.  Lattes are my choice for coffee stops and this one sounded so interesting that I knew I had to try it.  Luckily the shop wasn't so crowded that I couldn't get a seat because you can only get this particular latte if you stay; just look at the pictures of it and you'll see why.  The staff was very helpful about describing what the deconstructed latte was and the presentation was wonderful not to mention the taste.  With this order you get sparkling water to cleanse the palate, a latte, pasteurized milk, and espresso plus a treat to eat as you sip.  This is such a unique experience and I'd recommend it if you want to treat yourself. Coffee Project totally changed my perspective on coffee. First off I want to start by saying the service here is AMAZING. The guy who was working was extremely informative as to what everything on the menu was and he explained the whole process of how to properly enjoy a deconstructed latte very throughly. He was also super friendly and welcoming and let us sample the nitro cold brew. My friend ended up ordering the nitro cold brew, I tried it and thought it was extremely smooth and had a nice sweet note to it. The size was also good for the price. I ordered the signature deconstructed latte and hands down it was some of the best coffee I've ever tasted. The concept is totally unique and the espresso was smooth and not at all bitter. The milk was something heavenly and out of this world. Normally I'm not a fan of dairy milk, but as it was their only option for the deconstructed latte I had to give it a try. It was the creamiest, sweetest milk I've ever tasted and paired beautifully with the espresso and it's sweet notes. As for the caffeine, this latte definitely woke me up, but in a nice fully energized way rather than an anxious, jittery coffee high. I also want to capitalize on the atmosphere of Coffee Project. It's a smaller place, but didn't feel cramped. The decor was nice and the atmosphere was really chill and comfortable. It didn't strike me as a place that tried to force a certain image or vibe, and I liked that.  I also liked the concept of one table left for conversation and no laptops!100% I'm coming back here, this is my new favorite coffee spot. It's a hiding place .... already many people here to drink some thing. We ordered cappuccino and Americano. Taste so mild and good taste. A guy at register pretty nice deep voice and knowledgeable about menus. Good to take a break here! Tried this ginger drink that bubbles/fizzes when you mix it? I can't find it on the online menu but it was awesome! The shop is a little small, but seats are spacious and very nice setting inside the shop. I ordered deconstructed, which I liked the concept where you got to try the very raw original flavor of the espresso before consuming the latter. I also ordered a chocolate hazelnut scone, which was alright. I could not taste a strong chocolate or hazelnut flavor from the scone. Overall, this place is nice, and I will revisit. Almond Milk latte didn't need sugar it was perfect good start, deconstructed Latte was something different and I enjoyed it, a little pleasure if you have time to sit down and enjoy it and it's flavors. Cute little spot very friendly staff, will recommend and will definitely come back! Passed this small shop on the way to soho, and thought I'd give it a shot. Probably the best cold brew I've had in New York! The barista said that it's brewed from Mexican coffee beans. Friendly service and great coffee. I saw that they have coffee flights here. Will definitely be back to try! If there were 6 stars I would!!!1. Coffee is so creamy and DELICIOUS on the first day of snow in NY!2. Atmosphere is PERFECTO - nice quiet ambience 3. The severs are very kind and skilled barista4. I almost broke my lid and they offered to give a new one5. The quality of cups and machinery is High to say the least!",https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qCeQT_p_uNalc9Q1WoT2ag/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RN9YD6Ka_xIwPGZm9cZVQA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2Wtg4i2JV0N0ZZnl33S3Cg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/98YBx9eVtDUC_ZGxZ7AL7Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2hkpLlQEUByfKZ2jLOX_cg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BdAj09mL7v-BL8tzJmkZIw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pvx_FqsvIq9AiA1JylTIVQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/z3_NnQfhMCxek6ToKfXv2g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/J5_RcNDWgzJjlNPcWMcg6A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jqDeHV3aeihXtcmMNLa98g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fmI1Dyyjz2DUmOe00owG2g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/j9Pt9Ucachl10G2D6uKnxA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wrBGR3UCrVmbciFsBdz32g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Bx69lt2oL0POHEmZlsxvRQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/H5wT7Ba15qfV3tBMPxBznw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tHpHrPvbdaT0ggFTFX-J8A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mAOSrorDLBYcHFVbhXvXvA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MSCAu_o0YCnwGI-T5vPhlA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bOWBh7mcDwT_7Tp7pV5P5g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uVC51wSSnyu9IB9g8_0xcA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wHdw7CBEuoM6HSVrH3_pAA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vW-8CLgu_O6gj76unIrnKQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rxrgvk6QmiZwYYq8ioQbOw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QzggA0P4Mr8eKvCm1fsQpg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GsfKJexLqPMED_3l99SPrA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jYktQCreKVYfgthkaSBieg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/h2B6okC3FzfHdDtRmWQ_Kg/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/congee-village-new-york,congee-village-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Cantonese,NA,NA,"The food here is good. It's Cantonese style with a few creative spins on the traditional dishes. To our dismay, the sister branch on Bowery St has been changed to a hot pot venue. Luckily this location retains its normal menu. The 4 Stars is strictly for the food. Don't come expecting good service.  I had to ask for forks 5 times before someone actually brought it over. The cleanliness is typical of a crowded Chinese restaurant. When making my reservation, the lady only needed to know time and number of ppl. I don't know how she planned to honor the reservation without a name.Among the dishes I liked:-cauliflower with Chinese sausage (flavors of the sausage was really flavorful  and permeated the cauliflower very nicely), -fried shrimp with walnuts (delicious and was able to accommodate our request to put mayo on the side), -chicken with rice and mushroom in a bamboo log, (good as always)-pineapple fried rice-nice blend of flavors Only the DMV rivals this place in terms of how much the workers hate their lives.If you're in this part of the neighborhood, please love yourself and go somewhere else. Updating my review to a 4 stars, because I recently went back and we ordered a couple of dishes that I really liked.The first dish was the Fried Pumpkin with Salted Duck Egg. I was afraid my table wouldn't like the salted duck egg, but everyone loved it. Even the ones who have never tried salted duck egg before. The salted duck egg batter on the pumpkin was so crispy and delicious. It is quite oily and you could feel your arteries clogging up with each bite, but so worth it.The second dish I really liked was the Salted Fish Eggplant Chicken Casserole. This is one of my favorite dishes to order at Cantonese restaurants. I think it could have used more salted fish, but the eggplant and chicken was very savory and tender.We also ordered the Black Pepper Beef Short Rib which was also a hit with the table. I didn't like it as much though, since it was on the sweet side. I dislike when Cantonese restaurants make this dish sweet. The congee is still as blahhh as before. Even though they're called Congee Village, I'd rather come here for their other Cantonese dishes than the congee.I also forgot how huge this place is. Great place for large groups. I think I'd prefer coming here with a large group friends over coming here with parents. It's still not that amazing of a Cantonese place, but the fried pumpkin made up for it. Congee Village (CV) is one of those places where you either love it or hate it.  Of course I'm the former.  This restaurant is a hidden gem located on Allen in the Chinatown area close to soho.  Whenever I come here, I chose to come at off hours.  Whether it's during lunch or dinner, this place is Jam Packed!!The seafood here is fresh and tasty.  Especially their seafood congees.  We ordered the crab congee and the abalone congee along with some pea tips veggie.  It's simple and OMG good!!Remember, you've gotta come during off hours!! 5 star it is for CV!! I can't compare congee village's congee to other places since that was my first time having it. But, we ordered a ton of other dishes and they were all fantastic! My favorites were seafood cakes (not sure what they were called but they were crispy with chunks of seafood in it), spicy eggplant, and the steamed chicken with mushroom dish. If I go back again with a smaller group, I'd love to try some of the more exotic dishes. Only reason I'm giving 4 and not 5 stars is because it felt like they couldn't accommodate a group of our size (we were 15 people)--they kept forgetting enough plates, tea, chopsticks etc. We came here for a baby shower with ~60 people and we got an entire little room to ourselves with our own servers and bathroom.  This place seems very spacious and the interior is really cute and oriental. Their menu is quite large. I think if I picked the dishes out it would have gotten a higher rating. Sea cucumber with Abalone Sauce ($8.50/per piece)-5/5 I love eating things that my mom says will make me look prettier or is good for health. Don't think about them too much or else it'll scare you (lol). They're slippery and slimey but really delicious though! Braised Whole Abalone (S.P)-5/5 This is another one of the things that my mom say is good for health and it's also delicious. Young Chow Fried Rice ($11.95)- 3/5 Your typical fried rice. E-fu Noodle with Shitake Mushroom ($12.95)- 3/5 This is okay, very plain noodle in my opinion. Shitake mushroom was good but it only had a few. Live Fish Fillet with Scallion (S.P)- 4/5 This was pretty good. I love the fish and the soy sauce. This came with a ton of scallion and was devoured in a couple of seconds. The best Chinese dishes I have in the US! Even better than the one in China!The congee of the chicken and mushroom(<U+5317><U+83C7><U+9E21><U+8089><U+7CA5>)is like a traditional great-taste Chinese food ~ Chinese food on a carousel. Large groups, generous portions, quick service after being seated and an authentic experience. Does the job. Come here for the congee.  The congee is good. Veggies are pretty good. XLB is decent.The other dishes are OK, but not worth the high prices. If you are able, trek Southbound to Chinatown for better food. The beef chowfun was no bueno. Service is passable but don't expect any smiles or words upon departure. The hostess here is rude, hostile, and a liar. This is not a racist statement: she speaks perfect english but I literally don't believe she understands the definition of ""reservation.""We went in a group of 10 for a friend's surprise birthday dinner, and my friend made reservations for 7PM three weeks in advance. She then called at 5PM day of to confirm the reservation and was reassured that everything is good. You'd think everything would be smooth sailing after such meticulous planning but boy were we in for a ride. I was among the first group to arrived at 6:45PM and check in with the hostess, who looked up the reservation and immediately told me that there was a 45 minute wait. I inquired as to why, even with a reservation, there was a wait to which she said that by making a reservation, we were merely added to the front of the waitlist and had priority over the walk-in groups. I then pointed out to her that that's not how a reservation works and it just looked like they overbooked. She point blank just said, yes. Keep in mind, between all of this, she kept interjecting my sentences by speaking to others in Cantonese and ignoring my questions. By 7:00, our entire party had arrived. We go back in to check in with her on the status of our table, and she insisted that she could do nothing except go in and check to see what the situation in the restaurant looks like. However, that was just to avoid us because she would come back and ignore us and our question again, and offer no answers or solutions. By the time we chased her down again, it was 7:10 and we asked her if we could get seated by 7:30. She said no, 45 minutes. When we pointed out she gave the 45 minute estimate at 6:45, she claimed that she can't give us estimates because we were ATTACKING her for giving an incorrect estimate even though she was the one with a nasty attitude and practically yelling when she wasn't ignoring us. Then, she offered to get us a private room under the terms that we would order $400 minimum, and then raised it to $500 within a couple of minutes. HAHA GOOD JOKE 1) It's Congee Village, even for a group of 10 it's difficult to spend that kind of money; 2) Why should we be paying extra for their mistake?!; 3) They should be converting those private rooms to more efficient dining spaces because apparently they were all empty upstairs! Eventually, we got seated at 7:45-7:50, an hour after I first arrived, crammed around a tiny table where we couldn't eat without bumping elbows. On top of that, my friend's PLAIN CONGEE didn't arrive until the end of the meal, after we asked about it multiple times while we were eating. Looks like poor service was the theme for the night. Although we had a filling meal for less than $200 ($500 minimum are you fucking kidding me), the food was not as good as I remember from Congee Bowery days. SO upset that the Bowery location has changed to a hotpot place and we had to deal with the horrible, horrible hostess here. Needless to say, I will be staying away from this awful place, but unfortunately, I know there will still be an endless flood of people who will suffer the abuse of the nasty hostess to keep this place in business. There are more than congee to offer in this restaurant! So many more great dishes!!After I walk in through the entrance door, I see huge open space including upper dining area and lower dining area connected with stairs with original decorations. Dishes from XO sauce roasted ribs, strip steaks, steamed fishes, fried shrimps, squid, crabs steamed rice, to stir fry vegetables, steam pot tofu with veggies and mushrooms, styles of congees, ...etc. So many choices, and are fairly good. I would take friends gathering to this restaurant, for it's friendly and welcoming ambiance, and for the delicious food and variety of choices.Note: phone connection becomes weak if you take seats downstairs.This place is great for families gathering and Eastern style wedding banquet! Is it 9 pm on a Friday night, and all the shots you've taken for your Chitalian* brother from another mother's birthday are starting to catch up to you? Do you need a last-minute table for 12 drunk people in lower Manhattan before things get really ugly?Congee Village has you covered.This place is MASSIVE. It's a labyrinthian maze of raucous group dinners, and there's basically always a table available for you when you forgot to make reservations for someone's big birthday dinner.Is this the best Chinese you've ever had? Probably not. But I'm never sad about some salt &amp; pepper squid, house special chicken, noodles of all kinds, and of course, my favorite White Man Chicken courtesy of the honorable General Tso. All these things taste good, as does the massive amount of watermelon they brought us for the birthday boy (which he subsequently shoved into his mouth all at once like a champion).And the best part of all this? Congee Village has a full bar so you can keep the party going with more than just Tsing Tao. Although I always have a few Tsing Taos, because when in Congee Village...I guess I drink Tsing Tao. I dunno. ____________*You know, your standard half-Italian half-Chinese friend that we all have. Be ready for a very noisy and packed restaurant. It's always busy at Congee Village. The place is bustling and it's action packed. Food is flying out of the kitchen, people are always waiting for a table, and there are so many waiters zipping by. Efficiency is the mantra here.The food is a solid 4 stars - authentic, delicious Chinese food served hot! The sticky rice with crab, lobster with e-mein, Congee, Peking duck, and morning glory veggies are my go to dishes. Tasty and warms the soul!They have private dining rooms but they require a reservation. The private rooms are great. It feels like dining in someone's living room and it certainly shields the noise.Not great for a date but fun for dinner with friends or family.Oh, and the peanut crepe dessert is amazing! The food was amazing, the prices were really good too. The service was atrocious. We were a party of 7, got 2 menus and were promptly ignored. I finally had to wave down the manager to ask if we had a server. He took our order and never came back to check. The guys who ran our food out were annoyed when we'd ask for napkins and water. We thought our meal was free when nobody bothered to give us a check. But I hunted the manager down to get our check. Worst service I have ever received. A great porridge place in Chinatown. A bowl is usually about $6. If you have a small party, you will end up in a tiny space in the back corner but people actually come around pretty often it is okay. If you want to order entree, u might want to come with more people. It can easily get a bit pricy. For those low rate yelpers--I'm speechless to your comments. I really agree with what Isabel L. said in her review, ""you come in a Chinese restaurant expecting efficiency, not baby coddling"". On point bro. Efficiency is an attitude for almost all the Chinese, so stop complaining about how shitty the service is or stuff like that -- actually, the service is quite good here in my opinion, the waiters are easy-going and considerate.So, as a Cantonese who is born and raised in Guangdong, I'm constantly in search for authentic Cantonese restaurant in the US. This place can be categorized as the MOST authentic Cantonese restaurant with the BEST quality congee that no other place in NYC can surpass by far. Their congee  is exactly the same as that in my hometown. My tears can burst out when I have the congee because it reminds me of home!!! My review is for my takeout experience:I've ordered takeout probably 5+ times now and my experience has been consistently good. They're pretty much no bullshit over the phone and take your order as fast as you can say hello lol. My usual order is the preserved egg and pork congee and lemme say, it HITS THE SPOT. Super simple, savory but not too salty and flavor packed. Ultimate comfort food and Congee Village makes it authentic. My order has always been ready in 10-15 min. P.S. there's a card minimum so cash is best...AND there's a delivery minimum of $10 too. TLDR: slow service; extensive menu; portions are good and food is on the heavier / greasier side, but authentic and delicious--the congee is definitely the stand outHave been wanting to try this place for a while but hadn't gotten the chance due to long wait times. However, came on a Saturday around 2:30pm and my party of four was seated immediately.Initially was overwhelmed by how extensive the menu was, but managed to decide on: two orders of pork, chicken, and duck porridge, beef chow fun, scallion pancakes, chinese broccoli with minced pork, and short ribs with brown sauce. While we had to flag down the waiter to order, the food came out relatively quickly and in a progression, which allowed us to enjoy everything hot.The congee came first and was the best dish. It was the most flavorful congee I've ever had with chunks of all three meats throughout and surprisingly stayed hot until the end of our meal. The short ribs came next and were served on a bed of green peppers and onions. The vegetables had the perfect amount of crunch and the short ribs were smothered in sauce, tender, and both sweet / savory although a bit heavy. The beef chow fun followed and was okay but a bit too greasy for my taste. The scallion pancakes were also greasy but the oozing sesame oil made them taste delicious. Lastly, the Chinese broccoli was served and was kind of spicy although this wasn't indicated on the menu. The broccoli was cooked well though and tasted flavorful.We ended up demolishing all of the food and then had to flag the waiter down again to pay. Overall, would return for the congee and avoid the greasier dishes. Food tasted authentic and think my grandparents, who grew up in guangzhou, would enjoy it. Yummy congee that tastes like how it's made in China. Prices are great. Giving it three stars because it's nothing special, but on a cold day, hits the spot. I used to go here all the time when I was younger but now that I no longer live in the city, I rarely come here. Came here for the first time in a while to celebrate my brother's birthday. We ordered Crab which was amazing. The taste was amazing and so flavorful. Then we also had the Lobster Fried Rice and some cold jellyfish. Sounds weird but it was amazing! Can't go wrong with this place!",https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IJ2XgoqTLjpqYsj1ba5vRg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/U9pVT9IDni5P8K4AXseaCQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yKwF_JrSg4FNIMLD0FkpNg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ViH-Vb2XrPv1h9bD5-NSSQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4ivWRCKSFt_bnL-VqejR2g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/akiCXZ0a0YO_s-hWLXcMDA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/45D6EH-Gwz8Q7Fgg3Gx1ug/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Eo0apKayGvEc2OKcAECHdw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_7lxKLpNuWeI_tUwcSPL3w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fZKm1JdlYccFyycSL878Wg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fYlfDtmjpvbrs7TXauXSNw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Xhxbvwl0WWRiFQKwI1t-9g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MNDyNR1WWjLgT4A9pbtkZQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tuY1NPupbocU5Qq_-HcEKg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZRCMZexEyY4jz2U3N_CPGQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PnVIJBpm_fH2W3C8igMgpQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5KS6bGZZ9dx2B_PlqhSa9A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yg0NQP4ryZXuDlR6CREklg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UO027JQvFgM_wbQ8atBC4Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/T-peMQr5eaWkCg6RSQA55A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/a4gLDxil54bd0owBlLDi5g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/n0QLgZXO_IsRYWMzOCjhlQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Derx2LW8mXcjtBC4k3i-ow/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lTAYJtdEy5PFIn6cABviKg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XNRzaE6szg0NFG4ugXf4jw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pS6NrVhCpLRAv2MQiLdbbA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uy568YpZPx58staJ7RkrBQ/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/cornerstone-cafe-new-york,cornerstone-cafe-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Italian,Breakfast & Brunch,American (New),"Fantastic meal and excellent service at Cornerstone Cafe! Starters included delicious  pot of mussels (red sauce was my favorite), fried goat cheese balls, stuffed clams. The fresh salad with Cornerstone's house balsamic dressing (with goat cheese, cranberries and walnuts) was an unexpected delight.Main courses: the best ever all dente penne with vodka sauce and succulent shrimp (unbelievable!), fresh grilled salmon with sauted kale, grilled veggies.We had to pass on dessert because we were so full...although I did enjoy a cup of REAL authentic Italian cappuccino: the best I had during our NYC holiday vacation. I love discovering these cozy, intimate restaurants in the Big Apple! Cozy place with a neighborhood vibe but top notch food and drinks (with a nice variety) of local and organic fare.  There is a good wine list along with some specialty cocktails.  I had a strawberry Marguerite which was quite tasty which included a thick fresh strawberry/lime/mint pulp that could have been eaten by itself!  Come hungry: portions are big.  The wait was a tad long but there is god service, and attention to detail, so it is well worth it!  For starters we had the butterfly shrimp which were meaty yet easy to eat as finger food with a tartar sauce.  There were 5 or 6 which was no for Sharing.For the main course, we had the steak and mashed potatoes and cooked spinach - this was cooked to perfection, and HUGE!!  We were glad we had decided to share - there was still leftovers!! The food here is excellent!  The service...not so much.We went here because Clinton Baking Company down the street was so packed they stopped taking names for the day and had recommended two places to each breakfast, this being one of them.  It was 2 PM on a Saturday, so there was no wait to sit, but there were definitely patrons enjoying some brunch. However, the wait to get our order taken took quite a while, ad we didn't know who our server was so we waited at least 10 minutes before a server introduced themselves.  And by introduce, I mean no greeting, just a ""Are you ready to order?"" She was not friendly and seemed like she was over her day.  She never cracked a smile or a friendly anything to us.I originally ordered a hangar steak and eggs but changed my mind since I  read that the steak was small, so I order the 2 egg breakfast, which came with 2 eggs, a salad, fries, and 2 slices of toast ($4) with an extra egg ($2) and the French Toast ($11) instead.  I opted to up-grade my fries to a sweet potato fries thinking it would only cost another $1 since that was the price difference on the menu.  The server did inform me there was an up-charge as I suspected but failed to let me know that up-charge cost the same as a 2 egg breakfast, which I found out when I got my bill.  $4 for sweet potato fries?!The wait for our food wasn't too bad, but we had gotten half of our food order and the server made no mention of the status of the other half, so I as I was about to ask her, she said, ""It's coming.""  No smile. No charm. Just a pitiful ""It's coming.""  Uh...thanks?  On to the food...YUM!!!  That French Toast was totally worth it, and if not for the crappy service I may opt out of ever trying Clinton Bakery Company just for this French Toast.  It was piled with strawberries, bananas, and blueberries. It was very satisfactory.  I didn't even need the syrup. The egg breakfast was also good.  At no time during our meal did the server come to ask us how the food was or if we needed anything, and I was in need of a refill. For someone who makes minimum wage, she was not aiming to please. Or even fake it. Tipping is not compulsory, though I begrudgingly tipped her. I may have just gotten the wrong server, so I'll give this place the benefit of the doubt, but I will avoid her service from now on if I come back. The food is pretty good, so for a different server, it would definitely be worth the trouble of trekking to East Village. And they accept credit cards.There is a check-in offer for free coffee if you decide to come here. Delicious. We got the eggs Benedict, which was cooked perfectly. We also tried the baked eggs and they were super creamy and delicious, must try! The pancakes also look amazing and are an inch thick, but unfortunately we were super full. If you can eat a lot, get the baked eggs. Their mocha was good too, not too sweet but still delicious I really appreciate a brunch spot that does more than omelets and pancakes. We got the Eggs Benedict w avocado and the Egg Bake w Spinach Florentine, parmigiana, and tomato. The Eggs Benedict were good and can be customized; you can pick from spinach, avocado, smoked salmon, etc as the base. We had it with avocado, the eggs weren't super runny, and the english muffin was perfectly crispy. Their mimosas and peach Bellini are delicious too! The service was quick and efficient and the atmosphere is casual and cozy. There's usually a line here on Sunday afternoons, but I haven't had to wait more than 30 min the last 2 times I've been here. Coffee tastes from average to bland. I've had better experience with coffee elsewhere. Won't come back again. Heard this place had poor management.Service: 1/5Coffee: 3/5Decor: 3/5 I wish I can give more than 5 stars to this place! I love every bits of it! Never did I know brunch can be so affordable until I have met $4 brunch menu in cornerstone cafe! I came with friends to try this place that is worth all the amazing ratings and particularly, I don't believe $4 brunch exists (salad, fried potato and 2 eggs). I ordered coffee on the side (refillable too, say what) and I was feeling satisfied! My lovely friends ordered the $4 option too but paid additionally for sausages and bacon. They shared some with me because it was a generous amount, but overall we left with happy stomach and wallet! I would definitely come back to try their other options and the excellent customer service is a plus! Love the food, great but small place located on the corner of Ave B and 2nd Street. The food is delicious.  The only get 4 stars because of space. It's so tiny and clustered you almost feel like your eating at a communal table.  Which I'm honestly not the biggest fan of. Otherwise, good service and food. Hey, where'd my review go?... Did I delete it? HmmAnywho, I had the steak and the lady had eggs benedict. Food overall was uninspiring and the steak was small. That's it. Nothing memorable. Corner stone was a last minute brunch option as my girlfriend and I walked by. We saw the cool crowd and smelled the food and said hey why not. I went for the steak and eggs with home fries option while my girlfriend opted for the tremendously fluffy chocolate chip pancakes with their house syrup/honey. The yelp offer is free cup of coffee which works perfect for me I like to have a nice cup of coffee while I wait for my meal. The steak was well cooked and potatoes crispy yet fluffy. And the eggs buttery and delicious. Quite the filling brunch dish. My girlfriends pancakes looked quite amazing and huge! These things were the fluffiest  pancakes I'd ever seen next time I might opt for those instead. I just give those things a whirl. But there were a few options I wanted to try so I guess I need to go back a few more times to try everything cornerstone has to offer. The wait staff was also very nice and very attentive even with having a full brunch crowd and the wait wasn't bad at all about 5 minutes. Definitely a quality brunch spot! My wife was meeting her girlfriend while we visited New York City , so what do girls love to do....BRUNCH!  We waited outside in the bitter cold with a couple of heat lamps keeping use slightly defrosted.  The owner would pop out every once in a while to give us a heads up on when the next table would be available.  He was super sweet.  Once seated we ordered some craft beers and took advantage of the free coffee with a Yelp App Check-in.  Download the App, secret awards will await you!!!  Anyhoo...the girls split some pancakes and the baked eggs. To be the yin to their yan, I ordered the spaghetti with meat balls. It was a quality bowl of pasta that hit the spot.  The meatballs were big and light. Not full of bread crumbs.  Freezing my balls off was worth these meatballs.  Good food overall.  Worth the hype. At least I had a great experience here with my lovely French toast! The environment was nice and the food was great. One of the places I'm going to visit multiple times! Very nice. I came here for brunch on a Sat with a few friends when the original joint we wanted to go to was overflowing, and am so glad I did.We ordered the Eggs Benedict (one with avocado, another with salmon), and pancakes with berries &amp; Nutella. The Benedicts were fresh and simple: runny poached eggs on a lightly toasted English muffin (with the crusts cut off), with a side of roasted potatoes and spring mix. Was it generic? Most definitely, but I'm pretty sure it single-handedly cured my hangover. My friend's pancakes were the fluffiest things I've ever seen, like maybe an inch high each, and incredibly light and airy. I can't imagine how much baking powder was used to make them, but if you want fluffy, order the pancakes. They also had your typical brunch cocktails and bottomless coffee, and caffeine fixes everything.The service was great as well. Our food came out quickly, and the servers were continuously bustling around, making sure that our coffee cups were filled and that we had everything we needed. The cafe itself was cozy and a bit loud, but it's brunch in the LES, so pretty much what you'd expect. The wait here seems to be unpredictable (we waited 10min for a party of 3), but I would drop by again if I were planning on dining in the area. UPDATE: I finally got my hands on their baked eggs. A super great deal for $12 (i got the spinach one). There was a little more spinach than I wanted and very little tomato and onions but the dish was very good. Came with a side of two large slices of bread and baked potatoes. Can't wait to try their other baked eggs Came back here for dinner tonight with a restaurant.com coupon and dinner was delicious. We walked right in around 830pm, no wait. Choose any available seat, server was nice even after we told them we had a coupon. We ordered a pitcher of mojito which was awesome! They brought us bread and salad which we didn't expect (well the salad). The bread was soft and toasty, it was good. The side salad had this glazed dressing on it that was really nice. A little sweet and tangy.  I ordered the Portobello guac burger and my boyfriend ordered the lamb shank. My burger was good. It had 3 Portobello caps and it came with fries. My boyfriend's lamb shank was amazing. I don't like lamb because of the gaminess but the sauce on it was amazing. To the gaminess out and it was so tender, no need for the steak knife. Overall experience, excellent. Excellent when I came for brunch and excellent when I came for dinner! Highly recommend! We grabbed dinner here before our Broadway play and I totally felt like I was on an episode of Sex in the City!Cornerstone is small and has a classic New York vibe! We loved our meals! I tried the chicken parm, mom had the salmon. Our entrees were DELISH, and the portions are massive.Our server wasn't really involved in our dining experience (aside from taking orders and refills), but thankfully we really didn't need him so that point was easily overlooked. I hear that Cornerstone's brunch is the bomb.com and hate that we didn't get a change to check it out! (Sigh.) Next time, maybe. I came by for dinner mainly because they were open and had outdoor seating, and it had been awhile so I thought I'd give them another shot. Despite closing soon our waiter was cool about seating us and letting us look over the menu, and let us know before the bar closed if we wanted booze or coffee, we never felt rushed.The chicken parm hero is good, the meatballs are also solid.Trying for once to be healthy, I ordered the grilled salmon with mashed potatoes and spinach (no substitutions). Everything was delicious and cooked perfectly. Flaky salmon, creamy mashed potatoes, and spinach that was overloaded with garlic- just the way I like!But that damn salmon cost me $26. I was so proud of my healthy choice that I hadn't stopped to notice the price tag and that HURT. For a reference point, Pardon My French charges just one buck more for their oxtail entree, I just can't imagine where this salmon is from or what tales it can tell that make it worth that price point. As a New Yorker, I've learned to realize that Brunch is not just a word; it's a way of life.  I've had my fair share of brunch spots and Cornerstone Cafe is my favorite go-to.  I initially went to Cornerstone because as a lover of pancakes, I was on a hunt for the best pancakes in NYC.  The pancakes are DELICIOUS; so thick and fluffy and hard to finish, but of course I manage to finish the whole plate every time.  Not only are their pancakes bomb, but they have an AMAZING $4 deal that comes with 2 eggs, greens, potatoes, and your choice of toast, which is hard to come across in NYC, where everything tends to be over $10.  It can be quite crowded on Sundays, and was told that our wait would be about 30 minutes for a table of 2, but we literally only had to wait less than 10, so don't get discouraged when you see the crowd of people waiting outside. I went to Cornerstone for the first time the other day and I had the most delicious omelette of my life. The potatoes that accompanied the meal were incredible and their bloody mary is an excellent choice if you're okay with a little spice...which i am! i hope i get to come back soon! Very small and elbow tight and mainly great for couples. My wife and I got seating right away compared to families 3+. For a small restaurant the waiters are a bit distracted and you have to call them over in most cases. My wife and I found this place after we were told the wait time at Clinton Street Baking Co. Cornerstone became plan B instantaneously without any doubts. We sat in seats close to the door which we soon regretted because of the cold air that followed every time the door was opened. The distracted waiter brought us water twice then took a while before revisiting us for our order. I ordered pancakes and eggs and my wife just pancakes. Pancakes are huge and filling and if you are not a big pancake eater I recommend getting just one. The rest of the brunch experience went ok.",https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6scE9v_sLyFl-xDZuKeBow/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZeuZ0N749XUc80CGQoEzZA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jG1Eb2nEXO11RsQq4ERPsQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wwnf4zJrpWdxWL7XEDinFg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tX2y3SE29UTO5eGzCjWtWw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SDR0AEGg10WR9ZaPPW0ciA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VCpDRh-m0CJZcpNAuvpyrg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/S8Fy1XN3ZrJLuHBdzM8bzw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wfYFX9WBsouJef9vWkvYpg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Hq6evvlirOhKp0dbHmSMBA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/605Ct4QVPXa3lF2yLMVLyQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WCH0Ejs4FctHzDOqFq4Iuw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/a9Zm3DEYsYQDdHongFmUnQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6tXO5XdbeCAA-WQESYgFlA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3OEMERLT3HUpCqdkZHEZ8A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Nk0vhCvqvNQIOsygIErLGw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bBSkbcTs1Us5NWC5sAXJjg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tjGvio4T49bdzvzCXWJ8dQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_djXdRWMEM0Mkjh4wNkFYg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fHL58Gkp6hDbKoE49J8pWA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yjmP472hoemHWK8zSVLQ2Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bLs8wFxxfvfVS5Jcl0qd9Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/W6nRIy9Dek9-59WWfLpbAQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AEKUNnOB8LsnltKKU-rJGg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EQBz2X7iMPr0-oqOpBofyw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fSSI7yZeHsTguP3zT1ZCbw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6b_MpQJs617VKygg9qSwTg/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA

I stumbled on Creperie on my way to brunch and mentally bookmarked to come back. I ordered two (don't judge me!): the strawberries/banana/Nutella and the turkey/swiss cheese/mushrooms. Let's just say they definitely don't skimp on the ingredients. Although the strawberries and banana could have been riper, there was so much Nutella, I didn't have a single dry bite. Definitely ask for extra whipped cream. The savory one was solid but I wish I ordered the neighboring table's bacon, egg, and cheese. Or a second dessert crepe. The lady manning the counter and the crepe station was very sweet; she saw that I was clearly struggling to pick and walked around the counter to stand next to me and go through the options. She also treated both regulars and newbies alike with so much warmth. I'm sad that I don't come through this neighborhood more often; otherwise, I would definitely make Creperie a regular haunt. My friend and I were looking for a dessert place to sit and catch up and we found Creperie, which is open until late. We ordered the Famous Crepe which included strawberry, banana, Nutella, a scoop of vanilla ice cream and whipped cream with chocolate drizzle.It wasn't anything too different, but the crepe was made well with a good flavor, along with the fruits to give it the extra oomph and texture - a classic. I would go back to try some of their other concoctions.My only gripe is that it's a super tiny place and there is a $10 minimum for credit cards. One of few dessert places open at 12am when my friend and I were looking for a place to chill and catch up so we went on Yelp and walked over to this hole in the wall place!It's a pretty tiny place with seatings along the wall as well as a couple seats in the restaurant. Sitting next to the grill was probably not the best idea, especially in the summer but it cooled down after a while when the chef wasn't constantly making the crepes.We ordered the Famous Crepe which came with Nutella, Strawberries, and Banana which was a bit too sweet for me (probably the nutella) but nonetheless really delicious. I liked the fluffy texture and how thin it was and best of all, it wasn't overcooked! I will probably opt for something more savory next time to balance out the sweetness of the nutella but the fruits was definitely a nice touch. I did see the chef make something that looked like philly cheesesteak which looked quite interesting. It'll be on my list of flavors to try next! It was also nice that we were able to sit there for hours without being kicked out. Give this place a try with its many unique flavors. You'll be surprised at how delicious it is. :)PRO TIP: $10 Credit Card Minimum An awesome hole-in-a-wall crpe place in LES which opens late until 4am. I ordered a crpe with shredded coconut and caramel, and it hit my spot. Was looking for a late night crepe place open past 12am and found this gem. Saw the new Canoli Crepe and had to try. Also got a strawberry and banana crepe for the Mrs. Both were great. A real small place so you may have to eat outside. Needed a little bit of sweet and stopped in for the sugar and butter crepe.  Traditional crepe batter and it was good.  I think it had a little bit too much powdered sugar on it but overall not a bad snack to have when you're on the Lower East Side. These crepes are loaded! I got the Famous Crepe to keep it simple. The crepes are really thin, a perfect balance to the strawberries, bananas, and Nutella on the inside. I don't know how they do it, but it melts in your mouth. I basically inhaled it then and there. The Chocolate Lovers crepe is exactly what you think it is - filled with chocolate on chocolate on chocolate. Honestly a little too much for me. We packed half of it to go.It's a tiny space with limited seating, but thank goodness there was no one around when we went (during a snowstorm). Thought the crepes were a bit pricey, around $10 per crepe. Located on a narrow street with a lot of pubs nearby. Once you walk in the smell of pancakes roam the store. Its very small so I recommend to find somewhere else to eat your crepe. Theres a few benches to sit but not much. Overall the crepes were DELICIOUS. Nice dessert place I went to with a group of friends on a late Sunday night following the Super Bowl. First of all, this place is very small so don't be bringing 5-10 people with you. It's meant more for intimate parties. They have a vast selection of crepes so variety is there. I went with the Reese's with strawberries. Big crepe and was made within a few minutes. Also impressive was that they are open late and even deliver.Overall, it's a nice crepe place. I've had many crepes so far and this one holds its own. It's not my favorite dessert place at NY (see Serendipity 3) but it'll do. When people talk about the great ""hole-in-the-walls"" of New York, they are describing the rare breed of desert place. I came here after some brunch and wandering around the area. I had read some great reviews, but would not have thought much of it from the outside.Thankfully, my girlfriend and I went in and ordered a Fudge Crepe to share. It was made without the seemingly artificial showmanship of other Crepe restaurants, which was appreciated. When we first bit into our Crepe, we were really impressed. The decadent, melted fudge was both rich and creamy and the Crepe itself was thin and soft. It was really great, especially for a $8 price point. I'd definitely come back if I'm in the area! Had the grilled chicken with mushrooms and cheese very delicious would come again for sweets or for another. Good place to take it to go. Holy tamale! These crepes got me feeling all types of ways! The perfect balance of Nutella, banana and strawberries folded in such a light crepe! I have to admit eating this in a to-go-container in a car parked by the curb makes it extra special. And why not? The street is so lively and colorful! Next time I'm sitting on the curbIm docking a star because the whipped that sat regally on my beautiful crepe came from a can. The creperie is amazing. The cheesecake crepe was phenomenal. Tiny place barely anywhere to sit but there is a bench to sit on outside, or be a true New Yorker and eat while standing. Truly no other place like it A LAAAAAAARGE group of us converged upon Creperie last night (gave them advance notice lol) in celebration of our friend's 30th birthday. We literally took up the whole sidewalk and kept ordering all types of crepes until they ran out. Not only were we amazed at how they handled our group, but these crepes were AMAAAAZING, so hard to choose a favorite. Definitely can't wait to go back!!I wanted to share the video but seems I am unable to do so! Creperie... you are the temptress in all of us drunk people.Opened super late, great reward for bar hopping and a great way to end the night. How can you complain about Nutella?Though priced at around $10-$12 for crepes that I can make back in my apartment, I dont care. I need you for to finish my drunken adventure.Sober Patty probably would go for Creperie, but drunken patty does. Just load the nutella, please!! I shared the 'famous crepe' with my husband which is sliced banana and strawberries with Nutella, cool whip and and a scoop of ice cream. My daughter had the Nutella and strawberries and she ate the whole thing by herself. The crepes fill up the entire paper plate they are served on. Delish! They also have savory crepes on the menu but didn't try those although I certainly will next time. Small tiny space maybe enough room to seat 6. Good crepes, cute place.Friday nights are crowded for this tiny hole in the wall, but the crepes were worth it! Not sure how much crepes on average cost but my strawberry banana crepe with whipped cream and chocolate drizzle was $9.80 including tax. It was made very quickly, a good size, and tasted yummaay. You can also get the mix packet cup of hot chocolate for $2. There is a total of ~8 seats, so very very small. Literally a hole in the wall. Go check it out! I would give 5 stars if the guy behind the counter wasn't so mean!!! Delicious crepes! I got the famous crepe :-) Best crepes! Small place adds to the cool factor. They have savory and sweet crepes but I always go sweet. One is definitely enough for two to share. Get the Nutella, brownie, banana, whipped cream and vanilla ice cream. Amazing! Has a couple chairs to eat inside but mostly meant for grab and go",https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qPJsBznq4pVH5AD2m-gKKQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YLSbVAHVP5IPwhhttyHiKg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/sqSWe7Z2IJ0nVwYn8yBrPw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fNUoCYrJ2Px3y5VWOHjlCw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/i1Z_VWApPNoEZOlp3QZSnA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/si0EU9LA1f2lR9uaX9qxXQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/T7lDQLtWCdc7l3OGDfJ8Ug/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dX6itO1Kcvp85ux7WO3ntA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JA38niV4STlSzqoFN5xTgQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DfWzSprnXPhHCpZC3Cx_dw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rvbzLf6Wz6jR1ig7JTwY5A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3GRKhq6-E18QAOm3smV46Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XpCXo9QQM5DILnXANOwXXA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lFOaQZIXE77cHSGqvE6rcA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pc4OarkFEq9SaF6FdF2ebA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cLMio-HAPEdz2qyaVMrWBw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RUQyilUVcAs5vuk-DNCxgQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DNHzuRLuzRFw9CDqBVXCqw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ba2T7jnywSwUsT3kjEigRQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8-SqplAS3pGufBZmaYkuFg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_X1TpAlV8kcEHtJZvNm_sQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Q6pyQJMkKOO3CqtKomeRIQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UfSJ3pIyXLcjumRt2p7aOg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/L5lac4gDEyOXAZDYqlciWw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EZcFdY937PvWkoVVGpNdow/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jy1G7jyGCyfow1YYbOSjtA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PCRclGocZCx_L-sPcClXBA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vH3pb_F5ZTzjZmL1vDmPow/258s.jpg,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/dirt-candy-new-york-2,dirt-candy-new-york-2,New York,10002,NY,Vegetarian,Vegan,NA,"I have been twice. Once for dinner and once for brunch. The carrot hot dog is middling but everything else was fantastic. The monkey bread was especially good. Get the Korean fried broccoli Good brunch cocktails as well. I had a Bloody Carrie, which had mezcal and carrot juice. At brunch the celeriac Po boy was fantastic. Also enjoyed the biscuit. Overall, not that expensive for the quality of the food and how hip/cool of a place it is. Good beer selection as well. Make reservations far in advance Dirt Candy excels in my three core pillars of a great dining experience: atmosphere, food and service. And it earns my two bonus pillars: playlist and bathroom. Not only do they offer a delicious and adventurous vegetarian journey amid a unique environment that's simultaneously inviting and captivating, but Dirt Candy is also filled with delightful quirks that help place it among my favorite and most memorable dining destinations in New York City. Genius.The food here demonstrates how you can combine creativity and vegetarianism to achieve unparalleled excellence. I honestly don't have words to describe the food and the experience. Each course was superbly flavored with a mix of fresh ingredients, flavorful condiments (oh those fennel seeds were yum) and beautiful presentation. We had the five course meal and the lineup included broccoli hot dogs, brussel sprout tacos, carrot sliders, fennel salads, fried asian-style broccoli and more. Look at the pictures for the mouth watering presentation. The service is also brilliant. The menu states that the staff are fairly compensated and also get in with a share of the profits. Tips are discouraged. This is great to see. Complex flavors melded together expertly to create fantastic and beautiful dishes. You don't have to be a vegetarian to truly enjoy this amazing restaurant. They only serve chef's menu. You have a choice of a 5 or 9 course meal. We went with the 5 course, and I left full. Apparently the 5 course meal usually consists of restaurant classics, while the 9 course they usually include some experimental new dishes. I definitely need to go back for a 9 course meal. What we had:Beet dish - Beet balls stuff with some spicy beet something-ness. With beet cake, and some sweet twill-like glassy thing, with some amazing sauces. How am I supposed to remember it all. There were a lot of beet components, and it tasted amazing.Mushroom something and fennel salad: I'm not much a salad person so my friend enjoyed that. She isn't much of a pate' person, so I devoured that mushroom pate with the thin toasted bread that came with it. The mushroom on the plate was divine, and there was some candied pear? on the plate that was ok. Didn't love that. I thought it was carrots. Carrot Sliders and Broccoli ""Dog"" - The carrot slider was amazing. Had a great sauce with it, and I gulped it down in 2 bites. The broccoli dog - broccoli was really amazing. For me, this course had way too much bread. Perhaps I'd try to ask for Gluten free next time I go.Brussel Sprouts Tacos  - a pile of butter lettuce, a hot griddle with delicious brussel sprouds and about 12 little bowls of accompaniments. Guac, hot pepper, vegan crema, salsa, - ok, i don't remember them all. But you make your own little tacos and go to town. Its a huge portion. and really filled us up.Desserts: OMG. I'm usually too full for dessert, but thats the beauty of chef's menu.. you get em anyway. lol. Chocolate tart with carmalized onions, with a smokey almond (?) ice cream. You'd never believe it's vegan. It was amazing. Almond cake with almond ice cream - also great. Very light and airy. probably the dessert I'd opt for if it were a la carte, bec. its lighter. The service was impeccable.  I'll be back. Dirt candy has been on my list forever and I ideally wanted to go for dinner but i could never find a reservation (says a lot about how good it is). I went in for brunch and was extremely pleased with the food and service. Will definitely be going in for dinner. I loved everything. The moment I arrived I was greeted and seated at the bar. I knew what I wanted and the waiter was impressed that I made a great selection. I'm not a vegan or vegetarian but I'm starting to enjoy food without meat. I will be back to try more dishes from there menu. The Green Huevos was amazing. I've never had a tempura poached egg. It was amazing and the squash biscuits melted in my mouth. I felt like I was at grandmas house. I love biscuits. I don't even know where to start. The staff, the patience, the food, the artistry, the the the the food. The dessert. The cocktails and wine. The the the the whole of it. It's beautiful memorizing gracious dream. Initially I was skeptical, how good could this place really be? Let me tell you it's out of this world. Everything is cooked to perfection with a high level of culinary excellence from presentation to taste, this place will not disappoint. If you want a chic, up scaly evening come here, vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike will rejoice. Coming from a life long vegetarian, I was extremely delighted with the food. We had the 5 course meal and I've attached some photos. My favorite if I had to choose were the carrot burgers and the panfried broccoli (spicy and delicious).  The dessert was equally scrumptious as the savory items. I look forward to my next evening at Dirt Candy! Very creative and unforgettable experience. My favorite are actually the desserts. I absolutely am amazed by the popcorn cake and popcorn ice cream (where does the idea come from!), the fennel pudding (who knows that fennel can be so versatile), and the chocolate cake (there was something inside but I forgot) I also love the spicy broccoli, the Brussels sprouts taco, the tomato cake with carrot bread as the crust, the portobello mushroom foie gras. The bok choy with fermented black beans at first was the least impressive.  The carrot slides are also amazing with carrot bread as buns. The carrots in the middle is so soft and flavorful and full of juice. The five courses is such a fulfilling experience and next time I wish to try out the nine course option. It took us three hours to finish dinner and I can feel the waitress is a little impatient but she did not show her emotions. I felt bad though. When you call the restaurant, you can end up with a voicemail as the option but they will call you back. Make reservations ahead, and be ready to be amazed. Per one of my culinary school chef's suggestions I decided to check out Dirt Candy with my sister during my NYC visit this year. Our waiter suggested we order more than we had initially thought and it was probably more than we needed. Everything was creatively flavored and plated beautifully.  This was a true dining experience.We got the veg monkey bread with smoked garlic butter, Jalapeno hush puppies, Korean Fried Broccoli (wow! punch of Korean flavor and spicy to boot), Mushroom mousse with sauted Asian pears (I could eat this all day), the Zucchini takoyaki (i'll pretty much eat anything takoyaki), Onion tortellini (slightly under seasoned but amazing presentation) and the Butternut Squash Pad Thai (slightly over seasoned but really fun way to present a dish without your typical rice noodle.If you lost count .. we got 8 items off the menu. We were only going to go for 6 (which we probably should have) but I'm glad we got to try such a great variety. They are small plates. They are meant to be shared. So share away! Chef Cohen was gracious enough to sign her graphic novel cookbook for me as well as take a photo. Really cool experience.If you're out this way or if you're searching for a truly vegetarian (and vegan options as well) restaurant, this is a great place to hit with fun and creative flavors, this is the spot. Very chic restaurant - the open kitchen with the wide marble bar is also a great place to sit at and observe the food being made (especially since it is easier to get a reservation at the bar vs. a table)The menu is very creative, and the dishes come out beautifully plated. it is not just some random side-dish style vegetable dishes that don't make sense when put together. A meal at dirt candy feels like a wholesome meal.The yummy:Korean fried broccoli - it packs a punch in terms of spice level!Popcorn beets - the thai green curry goes great with itMushroom - the pears give a nice twistZucchini - one of my favourit dishes, the rolled up cucumbers stole the showBrussels sprout tacos - the accompaniments make the tacos interesting...beware though it is a huge portionThe cocktails were very interesting...if they opened up a lounge area, I would come here just for drinks too!Desserts are every bit as inspired, like the chocolate tart peppered with caramelized onionsNot so yummy:The jalapeno hush puppies - hardly any jalapeno, and a bit too dryCarrot sliders - the carrot sliders themselves were not a winner (I wish the sliders were a little crispier rather than a soft mushy middle), but the gingery slaw almost made up for the disappointment All the waiters were very polite and seemed happy to be working there. It is a no-tipping restaurant, so the service also feels a bit more genuine.PS: the restaurant lives up to its tag line ""Anyone can cook a burger; leave the vegetables to professionals"" :) To be fair, I am not a vegetarian, but my daughter is and she didn't want to go back. I would describe this place as a great eating adventure! The service is amazing and each course was beautiful. I have learned to cook a great deal of vegetarian food and it had flavor and I never felt deprived. Here, I felt like I was on a diet. The atmosphere was great, the staff wonderful and the drinks were perfect, I think it was just not my thing. Go and try it, you will have a great time! I cannot think of another dining experience in recent memory that compares. Amanda Cohen transforms a cuisine so often defined by what it is not to a cuisine that showcases the breathe and variety of foods that are often relegated to side-dishes and accompaniments.  The restauants logo is, anyone can cook a burger; leave the vegetables to professionals. So true ad so tasty! On top of that, the cook staff is at least 50 percent female which is unheard of in the industry. They make delicious cocktails too. This place makes amazing vegetarian food with an experience but I felt it was way to long. I started at 9:30 and finished at midnight. I got the 8 coarse meal and quickly realized it was too much. The interesting use it eggplant in dessert was really good. The non alcoholic beverage with beets was to die for! I looked online and the next reservation was not available until mid July so I had to see what it was about. Fortunately, if you do walk in right around their opening you will probably get a table as we did with no lines. The staff were extremely nice and attentive. The lighting and decor are so peaceful and great for photos!It's tapa styles so we ordered 6 things for 3. Truthfully probably could've done with five since I was kind of full. Word of warning though, don't over index to the fried section, you may feel kind of woozy later.We ordered the monkey bread, pumpkin pad thai, fried broccoli, zucchini takoyaki, truffles bread with mushrooms, and Brussels sprouts taco. My favorites were the monkey bread, zucchini takoyaki, and the truffle oiled bread. My least favorite was probably the Brussels sprout tacos, the price tag was quite high but overall nothing too special. We were a group of 3 carnivores but still enjoyed our experience, highly recommend to try! Went with family to diet candy, did the 9 course tasting menu for 4 people. We were very happy with this choice. Loved their cocktails! The first course with nasturtium flowers was wonderful and exciting. Most of the courses were good but out of 9 maybe 2 or 3 we weren't crazy about. So overall, pretty good! We had a truly magical experience. Service was absolutely wonderful. There were a few dishes we truly loved - the carrot sliders, don't remember the name but handmade spinach pasta,, the mushroom dish was my favorite!!!!, the beets were yummy, potato noodles were good. The Korea bbq was too salty for us. The desserts were delish! Our favorites were the chocolate onion cake and the parsnip cake! Really couldn't go wrong with dessert here. I've been wanting to come to this place for a while and reservations can be difficult to get. Fortunately I booked this place weeks in advance. The atmosphere is very nice. It has an open kitchen which gives off a nice relaxed ambience but the decor is still fairly nice to keep it somewhat upscale. The food was good but not as amazing as I expected. Don't get me wrong, it's still around a 4.5/5 but I think I had some high expectations for this place since I read about it in some different articles. The plating and presentation was on point as everything looked great. The flavors were very interesting and I even discovered some combinations that I didn't even expect to work together. The two dishes that definitely stood out to me was the Korean cauliflower dish, which my date said tasted legit (she's Korean btw), and the brocolli hot dog. The best thing about this place however I would say is definitely the service. All the waiters were very polite and seemed happy to be working there. They were also very good about clearing and setting our places between each course. There was one mishap where one course took a long time but we didn't really notice it too much since we were fairly engaged in each other's company but you may see evidence in the amount of bread I ate during that time. Eventually they brought it out and apologized for the wait. I thought that was nice of her to do that but then another person who was the manager also came out and apologized for the wait. Now, that's a good way to make us feel important! Eventually when we got the check, they even took off one of the meals for us so that saved us about $57. I was so impressed with the service I was planning on tipping them the amount they deducted from our bill but there wasn't even a tip line on the check! It's ironic that a place that doesn't accept tips ends up being the restaurant I would say has the best service. Obviously as you can tell we really enjoyed our meal thoroughly and definitely place on coming again (getting the garden next time!). I was so appreciative of their hospitality that I felt bad that I couldn't repay them somehow so that's what mainly compelled me to write this awesome review to them. Keep it up Dirt Candy! Very creative! This vegetarian place is on point. Their kale soup, hush puppies and money bread ore a must try! I mistakenly thought it was a vegan restaurant but it's vegetarian. But they made all my dishes vegan so it wasn't a problem.This is as Manhattan an experience as you're likely to get. Cerebral. Prix fixe. I did the 5-course. Some courses were mindblowing, some less so. All were original with complex, layered flavors. Will be going back for the 9-course when I can. I was quite disappointed with my experience at Dirt Candy - especially being that I was extremely excited to try it and support a fellow Canadian like myself! Initially I was required to wait much longer than my reservation time, which was fine being that it's a very busy restaurant although I received no apologies or anything like that. Once seated, I noticed that the chef was on the floor and visiting tables throughout the restaurant. I had read up on the chef and was very excited to see that she was there that night. I notified my server that I would like to say hi, being that both I and the chef are from Canada (Toronto). He said he would surely have her come by the table - this never happened. I reminded him again about an hour into dinner, although to no avail. The service was very lacking.As for the food, I thought it was very overpriced for the portion sizes. I can't even imagine how much you would have to order/spend should you go with more than 2 people. We started with the korean fried broccoli (which came with 6 small pieces) and the monkey bread which was probably 3 bites. As for mains we got the mushroom, carrot and pumpkin dish. The mushroom and carrot dish were good, although again very small. The pumpkin dish was almost laughable - for $20 you receive probably 10 noodles. Additionally, one of our drinks had to be sent back as it was essentially water.With that being said, the restaurant is very nice and has a great ambiance. Keep in mind that the menu prices online do not reflect the menu prices at the restaurant (each dish more expensive by a few $ at restaurant). Perhaps we had an off night.",https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nLvIW6uN9k6lTXbcRm2MYw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mpTJKSvB4j0mZTsIon7HDw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wPYGtroT3DtL7EhJqYbQmQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5ivh4g9_UHPO5wbILMxslw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CNRqh3sBvkoixzxValpwoQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PNvSv1zPwSA3xraxRfxi-g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VJnflDRyC6hFDF47msIGNA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Xm3J2OO4_WXd5-LkpPL_UQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/haYQkSC2LsOJiOUhnH9KCA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GiybgT75d3knd7e6l7ymFA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RL4aSR6y02VXCb4vAbuAaw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rXzTiNmkJwwrf-BWYsN3gg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NcTNDIMnMf6Dc9jZUkHkkg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0yuyFGKUXRKuB7jrcMhe9w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/G32gvBH10s2qekKYs21b5Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/H6wk9wYG9AgC7pa7H9zd2Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kmFEmVcZ70ZFEQWb93dvig/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vdUrhzMVALBYU0d-xWOCEg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/J148cydF1JNmwz_fN3qCow/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/eoYm2Vf-eYGQ61XgC--vsA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/66cenhAlLdEji_CUrSz8Kg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GqVQPC7UJore6O-oKWAaVQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/V9DG_miTbFJjgfxhqZgMZg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ONDRLMY08GdjcWkvGDB75g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ewkKgQMvXMblyJQZjTiY1A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Ph0PDGTf0IUfvGfnaTAwkQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Biyt0-vZn1VGbB5JhE3UvA/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/divyas-kitchen-new-york,divyas-kitchen-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Vegan,Vegetarian,Indian,"Delicious food, wonderful and friendly service. Beautiful ambiance, music was relaxing. Such a wonderful date night spot. Conveniently located right next to the wonderful Bhakti Center. What is your dosha? Well, once you know - they have everything for you here. Coconut rose dessert was so delicious. Avocado dip is a must order. Have some tea too.. it's cold outside! Service: 5/5Ambience: 4/5Food: 1/5.I really wanted to like the food here but alas. The menu sounds very sexy and I am confident they pick the best ingredients. The food is so bland though, absolutely no salt or any sort of spice, which in my opinion, is a must for any version of Indian food. Summary:Food - 4 stars (soup and entree); Desert - 3 stars (pistachio fudge). Ambience - 4 starsDo I want to go back? Maybe.. The food was good and a little pricey but it is NYC and East Village.  I had the following:3 prix fixe dinner menu consisting of:lasagna - delicious and it was a big size and very tastymung soup - very tasty and wish they gave me some crackerspistachio fudge - didn't look what I expected. It was tasty but I was still shock. I have been familiar with Divya (the chef) since 2010 when I took several of her vegetarian cooking classes at the same building (Hare Krishna building) - upstairs room.  Then I attended her Open Center Events and food outings.  Been a fan of Divya's and was happy to hear she finally re-launched her restaurant. There have been several versions throughout the years and this was does stand out as the classiest and trendiest of all of these evolutions. We don't always eat vegetarian, but when we do we prefer Divya's.One of the best vegetarian / vegan experiences in our beautiful city. We ordered way too much food so we can sample everything in sight.  It is rare when you come across a place like this - one that makes you forget that it's vegetarian.  The creamy vegetable soup was particularly memorable as well as the apple crumble.And Divya herself came around to each table to make sure everybody was doing well - that as a gesture is something we always appreciate as it shows that the chef takes pride in her craft. Everything about this place is SO important. The atmosphere is classy but approachable. It's like going to dinner at your richer-than-you friend's house. You want to be mad, because your friend's life is put-together, and perfect, and so aesthetically pleasing, but you can't be mad because she's also down-to-earth and friendly and looks at you in the eyes and genuinely nods when you tell her about your peasant problems.It was so pretty in there that as we sat down, my friend said to me ""wow, let's fall in love tonight"". The waitress smiled but seemed like she'd heard that before. And if we weren't already in love, this dinner would have made it happen.Spiced coconut chips are so delicate and flavorful and important. Waitress almost took the dish away before we had cleaned up the last crumbs and we both involuntarily yelled at her with absolute, desperate fear. She left the bowl, we licked it clean.Vegetable curry was perfectly warm and healthy and delicious and IMPORTANT. I tossed the mint chutney all over it and also had to lick this bowl clean. Busy night for my tongue, gotta say. Side of beluga lentils was thrilling and well worth $4. Beluga lenTHRILLs.Service is super fast and friendly and everyone seems to care about eating healthy wholesome food!Go here to fall in love asap. My time at Divya's this Sunday was absolutely wonderful. Such a cute and pretty atmosphere. Exposed white brick walls. Our server, Cody was SO KIND... personable and made our experience 700x better. We started off with the hummus appetizer and GF crackers. So yummy. Just wish there were more crackers hahaThen we shared the curry &amp; roasted vegetable bowl (as is). Both were delightful. What a great experience. Good prices. Will definitely be back!! This is my home away from home. Cozy ambiance, friendly and hospitable servers, and nourishing food that reminds me of the meals served on meditation and yoga trainings. Date and I had a couple of teas, coconut chips, and shared 1 pre fix plus another entree. It was so filling but not heavy, with some leftovers to take home. Mung soup was definitely soothing, the curry was rich, lasagna was comforting, and the carob coconut cake was a delightful way to end a beautiful meal. Came here with a friend who was craving healthy (I'm always down!) and hated every second of it except my walk across the well decorated restaurant to our seats.Nothing on the menu sounds particularly appetizing, but I go with the summer bowl after my friend says she hears its good. She orders the seasonal khichari bowl, and the waitress, who is white and not Indian, corrects her pronunciation of the word ""khichari"", and says that this is just for her ""future reference.""LOL I'm sorry but WHAT? First, I don't think you have the authority to correct the pronounciation of a word that is from another peoples (what are the chances you are also pronouncing it wrong, lady?). Triggering Triggering Triggering TRIGGERING. Second, what ""future reference""? There should be no assumption that we would be back again. . .The food came for both of us, and it looked meh, and tasted horrible. The combination of ingredients is incredibly random, and do not play well with each other. I'm not sure if its because they have left out a lot of spices and seasoning ingredients, but you really shouldn't put coconut into savory dishes when it's not a spicy curry dish. It tastes milky oil on my vegetables, but the fragrance of the coconut makes you think of vegan dessert. The sauce that came in a plastic dish was brown and tasted like barbeque sauce so I did not put it in my food.We all make mistakes, but at $16, this was a relatively expensive one, one that came with an incident that could have been funny but in the context of our identities and the environment, actually just triggering.  I'm usually down to go where people want to go, but I really don't want to come back here, even though the breakfast menu actually sounds pretty interesting/tasty. I mean with a dish title of ""Asian Stir-Fry Bowl"" and baby bok choy with ""cashew sour cream"" how can you NOT internally scream and run far away? Stopped in Divya's for a quick solo breakfast//lunch. The place was super cute, good for groups and small parties as well. The staff was welcoming, my waitress Ariela was attentive and friendly. I chose the savory waffles, it was rare for me to find a gluten free waffle. It had a good texture, different from a traditional waffle, definitely not in a bad way! I'd say it was more doughy than a regular one. The sauces were flavorful and the greens really gave it that something extra! I would love to go back with a group and try a few things to share. I went this place for the first time and had a vegetarian curry with roasted greens. Oh my got,,, it was the best Indian curry I ever had in my life.  I'm not vegetarian or vegan but it wasn't typical vegetarian food taste like. I am very happy I tried this restaurant that I have been very curious about for many months. I needed a place close to me to meet up with a vegan friend, and Divya's came in clutch. I was a bit nervous since we came at 9:30 and they were closing up at 10, but other than having us put in dessert orders a little early, they didn't rush us out and gave us amazing service.The atmosphere is peaceful and great for conversation. This works for a low-key date or a catch up with friends. You could definitely do a (non-rowdy) group dinner here, too. Decor is rustic elegance, with lots of white tile and beachwood.We started with the avocado dip ($7), which was garnished pretty watermelon radish slices and was tasty. Size is very small for the price so can't say I would recommend, though.My friend had the summer bowl ($16) and I had the khichari ($13). Mine was basically a lentil and rice mash loaded with vegetables, and it was super flavorful. Portion was nice and big-- was able to have some for lunch the next day and it held up as well. I felt nourished and not heavy at all.We finished off with the carob coconut cake ($7). Good stuff. Loved the rich, chocolately sauce, though the cake was a touch dry.Overall, I had a lovely time here. Divya's continues to impress. Would recommend even if you don't have dietary restrictions. I stumbled into this place on a whim, looking for a healthy lung after a yoga class and let me tell you I was BLOWN AWAY. The interior is beautiful and cozy. As I sat waiting for my to go order I was wishing I could stay and take in the dreamy decor. I ordered the Roasted Veggie Biwl and added leafy greens and roasted sweet potatoes for more nutrition. (DO THIS.) All I can say is that this was a phenomenal meal. The veggies were seasoned so well I forgot that I was basically eating a salad. The grains were fluffy and the sauce was creamy. I felt like a million bucks afterwards. New favorite spot. I discovered Divya's Kitchen through BlackboardEats, which was offering a 30% off deal plus a free yoga at the Bhakti Center upstairs with your dinner receipt. I like food and I like yoga, so of course I took advantage of that deal!My friend and I came here for dinner on a Thursday night. We had:- Coconut chips - crunchy, sweet coconut flakes that were sooo good- Focaccia - three pieces of focaccia bread that were dense like cake, and had little bits of veggies like carrots in them. Came with basil-parsley pesto on the side.- Carrot risotto - I got this as my main. I didn't know carrot could be so creamy! They make it using carrot juice and it also comes with basil-parsley pesto. Great alternative to regular risotto which can sometimes be too cheesy/heavy.- Pineapple upside down cake - served semi-warm with nuts on topThis place has a lovely, rustic ambiance with lots of fresh plants and flowers all around. There are some big tables too that could accommodate a larger group. Everyone there was incredibly friendly, and the chef (Divya) and the owner both introduced themselves. Overall, I'd definitely come back for a healthy and delicious meal! It was such wonderful experience of relishing soul food In a spiritual environment. A beautiful, peaceful start to the new year. Am glad I got the book . The lunch menu at Divyas was extremely limited and only two of the four options were available with only one plate left for one of the two. I ended up with the Kichari and my friend had the stir fry (the last one). I liked my entree, they give you a large serving (which hopefully you like since it is a lot of food). I also tried the Carob Chocolate cake which taste a bit like carrot cake. I would consider coming back if they expand the menu options. The decor is absolutely lovely here btw. I'M BACK!! And this time it was just as good as the last, or even better, because that pineapple upside down cake was DIVINE.I ordered the hot ginger tea to start and it was just what I needed on this super cold windy day, the kind of tea that will cure all colds if you had one. I like my ginger teas extra spicy and it was just that, just a hint of sweetness too. My friend got the almond milk chai, real chai made with real tea, more spicy than most - she found it a bit too intense but I liked it! The only weird thing was that the almond milk had a weird consistency that did that cloudy thing you often see happen when added to coffee, much like soy too. Taste-wise, it was fine!We shared the carrot risotto made with fresh carrot juice, celery, green beans + basil-parsley pesto sauce and the roasted seasonal veggies with quinoa wild rice pilaf served with tahini sauce. The carrot risotto was excellent! I normally don't like traditional risotto because I get sick of it easily (probably because it's always so creamy/cheesy), but because this version is made with carrot juice, and paired with the pesto sauce, every bite was delicious. I loved the roasted seasonal veggies dish especially because there were super crispy taro and parsnip cubes!! I went to town with the tahini sauce. YUUUM.My friend suggested that we get dessert and boy we made the right decision. The dessert special of the night was a pineapple upside down cake served warm with crumbled pecans on top. Oh my god, the smell of it as it arrived at our table was incredible. For your sake, I really hope they are serving that when you visit.Another special treat as we were paying - our waitress gave each of us a bar of chocolate because they were promoting it in their store! An orange/pistachio infused with turmeric 70% dark chocolate bar and a peppermint one. So sweet! Can't wait to try it.This place manages to wow me every single time. My only suggestion is that I hope they start doing specials for main courses since the menu is pretty limited - I say this because I want to keep returning!!! :) This place was absolutely delicious. Love the concept of healing foods and they did not disappoint. They serve the water at room temperature as that is better for your body (cold shocks your system). I've been to many places that claim they use Ayurvedic techniques and foods, but this place actually delivers. The juices are fresh and delicious. I had the Asian stir fry and it was one of the freshest I have had ever. The mint tamarin that came on the side was calming and yummy.2 yums up!! If you are looking to heal your gut (or just eat great food), this is your place. Best described as the spot to take your one vegetatrian/health-conscious yogi friend when you're not in the mood for rabbit food. This place caught my eye while I was walking down 1st ave because of the gorgeously insta-perfect decor. The place looks like a page out of a West Elm catalogue with cream linen seats, dark oak, exposed brick and rose gold stainless steel fixtures. But, the best part of this restaurant isn't the beautiful interior, its the food. Also FYI - they don't serve alcohol here. They are holistically-focused on a concept on health and they're consistent with their choice of not serving alcohol. They do have an assortment of health-friendly teas however. Started with the AVOCADO DIP ($7) which came with multigrain crackers and watermelon radish. This is pretty much peperry guac, delicious, but still guac. Loved the radishes. Then ordered the LASAGNA ($22), and my oh myy it was so delicious. Its made with pesto and veggies, and I would've that chosen over many non-veg lasagnas. Great flavors and perfectly cooked veggies, the the cheese/cream was a great combo (not vegan).This place is fantastic, and I will be returning. The menu is a little pricey, but the quality and the care in each dish does make it a higher quality meal. The service was fantastic and I was very pleased. Who said you need a glass of wine at dinner to have a good meal anyway? :) Lovely vegan menu closely managed by Chef Divya. Curry bowl, savory waffles, sweet waffles all wonderful. Amazing selection of unique teas. The restaurant is so pretty and has such a calming zen ambiance to it.  My friend &amp; I (both health food lovers) each got the roasted vegetable entrees with added leafy greens along with a cup of their Sugar Down hot tea.  The tea was so aromatic and heart-warming, wouldn't have expected anything less from this place!  The roasted vegetable dish was simple but delicious - very well seasoned and a nice big portion too.  The only complaint I have is that it's all a bit pricey for food that should be more affordable (aka veggies, legumes, and grains), but it was all good so I'd love to come back and try another dish!",https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4P8f4ALNDzcj2MjKrxw5Zg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MrxsegFLuY2QfRC6LXAyXQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Gw77o_47JV4UeDHDDVv5Uw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/S9W3Xz66NlsxODCZRLIPBg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/I1vQsPql_aODX6RVjZqE9A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2uIpup8QqPF8MFPiw1TgRA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CbHXCz0xlBmdpvCFmm-y9g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQmYe7swEM7xZQ4PiWx4jw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xV9XmKciUoBQ0VST2ANJxQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ehwwGBGo_obduyM3_EL4-A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jKn9B5zv8vbo_pK7uxZDQg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GVY2VQfpP0YC9Qn8yUIWbw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fPQ3ehS7HFnpKGfmt5vSZg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/z4YvokNqPGUex1Q42kvzmg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jsvLM9v5Hmt3seJX0zybqA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xW-yMYufVWWThGwi94VmbA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/icoErD_JFFU4sIfndBglKg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AWSI-MLNCzCL15os-zCyYg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/I-esdGuF05pt0lLNKZOffw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/aGyUCVgcflhrz4RgEt51wg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Zj1qApBaoLksFJAMFsK9qA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RQllFMh8DL6oEAP1WMnH-A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Sl89pq_uD7f67-kCVSSDyg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ocN6w1yDAq9OBFlhPTv21A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5vw5D74XkUHGqfDDowZr2Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DkiQjOCaCrxJVY0bk7fPgw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XMLDcQuJ24BDpi88X9q6TA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JuzRh_t7Vdia6_ca5a6Q_w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7mPUqn8VPl6DlgM8OeVMbw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IEJXlMfzRzzDUV8uuvbIdA/258s.jpg
https://www.yelp.com//biz/doughnut-plant-new-york-4,doughnut-plant-new-york-4,New York,10002,NY,Donuts,Coffee & Tea,NA,"I visit New York City around 15 times per year and without fail, I stop by The Doughnut Plant each and every time. When I began coming here, the only location to choose from was Grand St. Then Chelsea opened up and now you can even score these doughnuts in some Dean &amp; Deluca shops. Look: without a doubt these are the best doughnuts I've have had- in New York, in the US, in the world.  I've tried places like Glazed &amp; Confused and Doughnut Vault in Chicago- which are awesome too, but nothing holds up consistently than the Doughnut Plant. You get a choice of cake and yeast doughnuts here in addition to doughnut seeds (which are these little balls of dough filled with creative creams and jellies. Most famous is the creme brle doughnut which has a caramelized outer shell with delectable custard filling than even the most discerning French pastry chef couldn't deny!In the assortment of cake and yeast doughnuts you'll find some unique flavours not found at standard doughnut joints. Even better are the seasonal doughnuts that change, get this, with the season. At moment, you can find some Japanese inspired doughnuts like Yuzu (in both cake and yeast) as well as Black Sesame. If you live in NYC, then I don't have to convince you. Chances are you already know and visit the Doughnut Plant.  If you're visiting the city- make this a stop. You will not regret it. P.S.  this place makes one of the most authentic tasting chai.  And believe me, having had chai at home, in Toronto, in India and everywhere else that purports to make this Indian version of tea, the folks at Doughnut Plant make it right. This place serves very basic and bland donuts. I ordered the chocolate sesame and the glaze donut and my taste buds were not pleased.The chocolate donut tastes like a basic chocolate donut any other donut shop has; only difference is that it is overpriced at $3.50. The glaze donut was also very bland. I do not recommend place to satisfy your donut cravings. Any other donut shop will surely serve the same taste. Walked 40 minutes to get to this place and upon arriving, the doors were locked. It was an hour until closing and there were people still inside. We tried to read the sign that was posted, but the font was way too small and the people inside were giving us side-eyes. We assumed the people inside were employees having a meeting. I find it strange that they chose to do this during business hours and did not acknowledge us tugging at the door to let us know they were closed even though they made eye contact with us. If you plan on having a meeting during business hours and closing up shop, please at least post up a bigger sign in big cap letters that says ""CLOSE - HAVING A MEETING"". The sign had a paragraph of words and it was so hard to read. Since we couldn't read it, we weren't even sure if the sign was intended for the meeting.Didn't get to try the donuts, but read they were good. Will change my review if I get to visit again and it's actually open during stated hours this time. The doughnuts here are super unique and really get someone like me excited to try! I was in the area and decided to (finally) try this place out.I'm a sucker for carrot cake and tres leches cake - so you can guess what donuts I got! Each donut was $3.85.The carrot cake donut was moist and tasted exactly like a good carrot cake. Some bites had cream cheese frosting, which I absolutely loved. It's a somewhat heavy donut but well worth it! The tres leches donut didn't exceed my expectations but it was still good. I expected it to be more moist and sweet than it was. There were bites that were more moist but I expected that throughout the donut.Side note, there isn't much indoor seating so this isn't great for large groups. It's designed to be more of an ""in and out"" place.Nonetheless, both were good and on the higher end of donuts I've had. I definitely recommend checking this place out. This is my go donut spot in NYC, they have a variety of flavors so there's something for everyone. Their filled donuts really stand out here and it's what I love about this place. Most people love this place or Dough (which I am also a big fan of) but their filled donuts edge out Dough by a drop, they just make it so perfect here This donut shop is da'bomb, they have a wide range of flavors at one time. The donut section is in different categories, filled, cake, glutton free, vegan and specialty. These are a little pricey ranging from $3.75 to $5 and they don't offer any discounts when ordering in dozens.We tried the banana peanut filled donut, this one was a square donut (similar to Valhalla to my Orlando peeps). This one was pretty filling on its own, so it's a good choice to share. The second donut we tried was the carrot cake, although I was hesitent because it seemed to ordinary, it was actually really good.The last one was the limited edition Christmas tree donut, so pretty and insta worthy. It's a green donut that is mint flavored with chocolate filling.If you're visiting NYC, this place is a must, excellent sevice, great variety and comfortable sitting area. This was my first time coming before they started running out of flavors! My friend's go-to was the chocolate cake (Brooklyn Blackout Cake) and I was surprised at how good it was!MUST-HAVES: Brooklyn Blackout Cake!* Pumpkin - 3.5 starsI usually love anything pumpkin, but this was mostly sugar. The texture could have been softer as well - it seemed a tad stale.* Concord Grape - 3 starsThis was fine, grape is just not usually my thing (I didn't pick this one). * Brooklyn Blackout Cake - 4.5 starsI wouldn't normally choose a cake doughnut, but this was incredibly moist and rich.* Tres Leches - 4 starsAlways a good go-to! I really love these doughnuts. We made the mistake of going to the other location, as it seems the doughnuts are actually manufactured in this location. The last time that we had went it was during the cold months and the doughnuts were ice cold from the transportation.That being said, I'm very glad we came to this location. Every dought we ordered was a hit; yeast or cake it didn't matter. The yeast doughnuts were soft, chewy, and toothsome; the glazes were spot on and not overbearingly sweet. The cake donuts were moist and not dry; and the flavors were excellent as well. We had a large meal beforehand but still had room for the doughnuts; dare I say they would be even tastier on an empty stomach.I believe the flavors we ordered were the pumpkin seed yeast, tres leches cake, blackout cake, apple cinnamon yeast, cinnamon bun yeast, PBJ yeast, blood orange rose yeast, and the valrhona yeast. I would say the standouts were the blood orange yeast (it was the most expensive one), blackout cake, and the valrhona yeast. But, they were all excellent. I would say this is an astro doughnuts with better selection and flavors if I were to put it into DC terms. I had high hopes for the Doughnut Plant base don the yelp reviews.  We came here after lunch looking for gourmet donuts.  I tried the creme brulee doughnut and I have to say that I was a bit underwhelmed.  Maybe my expectations were too high after reading the reviews.  Potentially if the doughnut was warm it would have been different.  The place has a bit of an industrial look with Doughnut cushions/pillows on the wall. The decorations were funky and cute.   Overall though, I probably wouldn't go back, too many other places in the city to try. God damn you, Doughnut Plant. Coming back to NYC, I stayed in LES this time around. You were approximately 8 walking minutes away. Thus, I stopped by to eat here every morning for 5 days. Star Jones would've been proud. Peanut Butter Banana Cream [$4]F*CKING. CRACK. THAT. YEAST. THAT BANANA CREAM. F*CKING CRACK. By far the best doughnut I've ever eaten. ORDER NOW!Apple Cinnamon Yeast [$3.80]Had the right amount of apples to cinnamon, wasn't too overpowering and not overly sweet.Vanilla Bean with Blackberry Jam Yeast [$4]Recommend this one. I thought the blackberry would be too much sugar but Doughnut Plant just knows what they're doing.My suggestions: just get anything WITH YEAST.SKIP: Vietnamese Iced Coffee. This ain't Vietnamese iced coffee. I know my stuff - my ancestors are even upset with this wack attempt. Nonetheless, for the 4 days that followed I continued to get a flat white instead ($3.75). Approved. I have been wanting to try this place so bad and I finally had a chance!! I'm usually not a cake donut person so I went with the cream blurre everyone talks about and green tea cream filled.  I tell you I have never paid $4 for a small donut but the cream blurre was the bomb!!!!   The surface is crispy with burnt sugar and it had the perfect sweetness to it.  My favorite for sure!  Green tea filled was pretty authentic as well.  The filling had the bitterness from green tea but sweet at the same time.  There are about 5 tables inside and two benches outside (which is obviously too cold for the winter).   I would love to go back and try some more!!! They have another location in Tokyo as well. Small but cute place with delicious doughnuts. The doughnuts are more of a cakey consistency than most doughnuts so they're pretty dense but I'd say worth the price (~$3.75). I tried the glazed and double chocolate ones (Not sure of their exact names) but both were delicious. They also brew/sell their own coffee here. I'm not a big fan of donuts but when my friends took me to this place I fell in love their donuts instantly. I love their unique flavors especially oriental ones. Another thing that makes me keep coming back here the texture of the donut. It's almost like cake and flavors are so rich I feel like I'm having a meal. Haha I usually hate the taste of fried donuts bc of that distinct oil flavor left in your mouth, so while everyone was pressuring me to check this spot out, I didn't want to at first. However, after three more friends said it's THAT good, I caved. And I'm glad that I did. Came by on a Thursday morning, to a very small crowd and line. This is a very tiny spot. Three tables? A bench outside? Grab and go is def what this spot is. Anywho, I wasn't sure what to get. There were so many choices! I'm usually a citrus or fruit-loving baked goods kinda girl, but that day, they unfortunately didn't have any. Welp, fall season brings out the pumpkin, so pumpkin flavor it was. Got that small pumpkin filled donut. The girl behind the register gave me a ""seriously, that's it?"" Hahha. Seriously, that's all I wanted. In the end, I was surprised by how much I liked it! And it was the perfect size for me to try. I'm still a lover of my baked donuts...so I'm gonna have to stick to my 4 stars for this one! Plus the smidge bit of judgement for my one donut, geez! The doughnuts here are pretty good, but for all the hype... I've had better ""gourmet"" doughnuts elsewhere.I have a hyperactive sweet tooth, so I stopped by one day to sample their crme brulee doughnut and coconut crme doughnut.  The crme brulee was really delicious - I loved the crispy, caramelized brulee layer on top and the generous amount of vanilla custard inside.  The coconut crme was okay.  I couldn't taste much coconut flavor... The people here are really nice and friendly, and made a lot of good recommendations on what to try from the menu.OVERALL: 3/5.  Good doughnuts, inventive flavor combos.  As ""gourmet"" doughnuts they're a bit pricier and there are other places I prefer, but I'm happy I tried Doughnut Plant while visiting NYC. I LOOOVVEEEE doughnut plant and try to make a point of stopping by anytime I happen to be in the city. My favorite is the grand street location. My go to flavors are the PB&amp;J (Yeast), Creme brulee, and tres leches. However, it seems that jelly in the PB&amp;J has chained to rasberry from blackberry. I'm not sure if this is a permanent change, but the blackberry jam was sooooo much better. Hope they bring it back. I also try to get some of their special flavors since they are only available for that month. I really like the matcha ones. This time we got the pumpkin with spiced pepitas (cake) doughnut. It was tasty but a bit sweet. I prefer the tres leche, but it was still yummy and fun to try. I've been here a few times over the years but never got to reviewing it as I'm not really a donut person, the blackout chocolate donut was good and is somewhere in between a cake texture and a donut I love the wide variety they have but not the biggest fan of their donuts. I got the Wild Blueberry one and I liked how it didn't taste artificial, that's such a plus. However, I also tried the Red Velvet that my friend got and we both found it off and it didn't really taste like red velvet. I also felt a little sick afterwards, so I don't think I would go back. There are definitely better ""gourmet"" donuts out there. If you're looking for a snack before you head onto the Staten Island Ferry, look no further. I got both the wild blueberry and coconut cream donuts and they were good! Nothing special, but the flavors do stick out. Fast service and decent prices, I left satisfied. Doughnut Plant gives me life. In Woody Allen's monologue in ""Manhattan"", he lists a variety of epicurean pleasures on what makes live worth living. The list includes Louis Armstrong, Cezanne, the crabs at Sam Wo's etc. Well, he missed ""matcha doughnuts at Doughnut Plant"" because I'm not sure if words can adequately describe how good they are..perhaps moans.Pricier than your momma's doughnut joint but for good reason. Made fresh with everything made in-house, even the jams for the filled doughnuts. My gateway drug to this wondrous palace of calories was the matcha cake doughnut, but I quickly found that virtually every flavor here is excellent.Cake doughnuts are moist af with all-natural dense flavor, and the yeast ones are huge with ITSSOFLUFFY fluffiness. All served in a festive atmosphere by cashiers with perpetual smiles on their faces.My abs may hate this place but my soul loves it. They say nothing tastes better than skinny feels...but really who needs that kind of negativity in their life?",https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ByIdPZzld6KNutaZr2rlOg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_Ge9Ijp5AJRUUZb8TdDMyg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rZbGpvLSBG5nlwh7nT-c2g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BHXNGjIXSjx8rVM2mu_-Lw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cxJgto-NWW3Sga5XXeBwBQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NRQAxDjRzCeHl5JoqNy_fw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/aYsI6rS_VYaNUW_tZGXw4g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bLc8r4hVqhmQDd_nSekYtA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gj2UIkEKKtE5LTUy9biP3A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/O9WEcBZ-H0Kl9WExzh14Kw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5Vg22xsWz-BHQ8oNIFKdmw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/S5f6iAyhv7SdDMzziFOejA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WucHgD-vtXhenSQ8XfAZ6A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rszQeayZzzPFmE2pl-GraA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PxyVqBK_1bEw1l2Cxc-PwQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uZQWzvVPYLEl2xbtqroWeQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PqqKyFNiQ-gOpCZ0qIlwmw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MZa_OhJfjEwoZ2wnywfXVg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fHEx7eot30nSvahXAZIHVQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/A_DDHMWSs2mf7Kt2PfEMJA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hoIrcPiTOOkqLiZFcRkSJg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0ZBac1WLxpZZXC35d3Eccw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KAIXEVJp5SOWwH5IaNHtEQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JcToVzpDSjJHS_eOQqoZpg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fW1aZ_CZSMc5JN0oqtxvNg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HttY1UQV-6dnwteyrD--gQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wmKMRyQAYJPBhrlg0dFdWA/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/dudleys-new-york,dudleys-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Cafes,Breakfast & Brunch,Burgers,"I started the year at Dudleys for New Year's Day brunch. The interior is trendy and cozy and our bartender/waiter (I sat at the bar) was friendly and quick. The drinks -- matcha latte and Bellini - were on par with the rest of the neighborhood joints. I had the big brekkie which was hearty but not heavy. It didn't lead me to a food coma so it was a perfect meal to jumpstart the day. Everything tasted good but wasn't outstanding or extraordinary, so this is what I landed on after factoring in the prices and wait that is almost always required on the weekends. (Even for just one person for a bar seat, the wait was ~20 minutes!)The menu is rather typical for an Aussie-styled cafe of this sort, so if you're into that vibe and are looking for those standard brunch dishes (avo toast, healthy bowls, etc.), Dudley's got you. I got the mushroom Benedict, which came with a side salad (that was disappointing because it was just large leaves of lettuce in dressing), as well as a matcha latte (which was well-made, but not of $6 caliber!). Everything was prettily plated! Perhaps their popular fries or brunch drinks are the standout, but I wasn't super impressed. Lots of other tastier brunch options in the area (though I will say, for an Australian cafe-type choice, this may be your best bet in the neighborhood). Went on New Year's Day. The line wasn't too crazy and we waited only for 15 min. The restaurant is small with an open kitchen. They also have a cute table downstairs for bigger group. Choices were plenty with reasonable prices. My friend ordered big breakie and I ordered the Norwegian salmon with eggs. Decent size and well prepared food. A good place for weekend brunch! Came here on a Wednesday afternoon with two other friends. I had to wait around 10 minutes for a table but no wait for the seats near at the bar. I actually wanted to try their Norwegian eggs benedict but they said it was only a weekend brunch menu. That was fine, so I choose the Avocado Toast with a matcha latte. The host was pretty nice and quick however, their service was pretty shitty honestly. We ordered our food by the counter and our drinks and the barista/bartender guy completely forgot our coffee and drinks. The food took forever to come but he gave us a complementary drink since the wait was long. When our food came along, he didn't even remember our drinks so we called him out again. He gave my friend the hot chocolate in a acme cup, but he gave my matcha latte in a regular water cup. That's not fair at all because matcha latte's are suppose to come with an acme cup. Like whatever. He also forgot to give my other friend her coffee. Like, how do you mess us 2 times. It's honestly not that hard to mess up. For my avocado toast it was pretty but the TOAST was hard. I had a hard time cutting it with a knife and when I ate it, It felt like the toast was STALE. Honestly, the Avo toast is a 2/5 star rating and I don't think I would come back here for brunch/lunch. There are a lot of brunch places in Little Italy/Chinatown. NOTE TO SELF: DONT SIT OUTSIDE UNLESS IT'S SUNNY AND THERE'S NO WIND!!! The wait to sit inside was about an hour but outside was right away. So, my friend and I decided to just sit outside. It was a little chilly but we didn't want to wait an hour since we were starving. I ordered the ricotta hotcakes with banana and maple syrup, and my friend got the shrooms benedict poached eggs. The food was SO GOOD!!! The pancakes were so soft and topped with maple syrup, it was perfectly sweet. The only con was that since it was a little windy, there were a bunch of leaves flying around us and it got in our food and water. So, we just got the check and ended up leaving :( The service was great but the food was a little pricy Dropped by for brunch on a random Wednesday because the wait here for the weekends is always pretty long and was seated immediately!The big sister restaurant to Ruby's- located in LES, is more of a solid restaurant, with a bar and deli side. The menu has some resemblance to the other, and both has the Bronte Burger (which if you have not tried before, most definitely indulge and get it because you will not be disappointed.)I got the Crab Linguine (18$) - quite pricey I know for ""brunch"" and there were not a significant amount of crab meat in the pasta dish- but I would still get it over and over again.  My friend got the Roast Prime Beef with arugula, and we were both so impressed by the quality and cut of the roast beef.  Our server told us they roast it for over 8 hours in house - and you could most definitely taste it in the quality of the meat. Only complaint or suggestion would be to order the dressing for the salad on the side because by the middle to the end of the meal, the dish was getting too salty.Overall, still a solid brunch option and I would always return for the fries as well. This is a phenomenal place for brunch! My friends and I came here and ordered a bunch to share and our favorites (in order) are the bronte-burger, granola greek yogurt and the big breakie. Just thinking about the bronte-burger mmm.... yum. Food and service alone is five stars. But (not that there always is one), expect to wait a bit because this place has quite the following right now. And expect to be seated near shoulder to shoulder with others. Picture the waitress having to move tables just so that people can get to their seat because they couldn't pass through.Definitely top notch food, so don't let the wait or the space deter you from a great brunch. Decent neighborhood cafe with outdoor seating in the warmer months and very decent iced coffee.  The food here is pretty good but not spectacular. Perfect if you just need a bite but are not looking for anything specific.  I really enjoy their avocado toast.  Salads here are pretty good and fresh but imo not worth the price.  Prices in general here are standard for the area-which means a little overpriced-but nothing crazy.  Cool place to grab a snack and read a book, get some work done, catch up with a friend or waste a little time if you're early for an appointment. Bartender is very charismatic and nice. Nice chat. The drinks are well made. Long island ice tea made with real ice tea! Very good!! I got a chicken at the outside to go window here.  The place has curb appeal with lots of windows, but being relatively dark inside and decorated with lots of little light bulbs.The dining area is lovely.  It's sort of modern Paris bistro meets a digital micro chip - all in black with electric light impulses around.I got the half rotisserie chicken with fries, it was $11.  It was so absurdly cheap I felt guilty.   Fries were thin but kind of interestingly puffy with a coat of spice powder, crisp.   Chicken was satisfyingly plain - like something wholesome you want when you're sick.   The food was filling and of good value.   The vegetable sides looked wonderful like broccoli rabe, but I wasn't feeling healthy.   My friend says he gets the half chicken for $16 with two vegetables.   I think that would be a wonderful healthy meal on the run. Trendy LES has a little grunge and some satisfying food - and this strip of cafes on Orchard typify that.   If you eat dinner here, you can bar hop close by easily.   The take out window closes around midnight but I think the dining room is open later.Food - of good quality and value Atmosphere - young, trendy and cute.     It's really a diner in the guise of a bistro,     But you can easily pretend it's a bistro. Coffee in the day while bar at night, Dudleys is a perfect way to kick off the weekend.This was the last stop of my running journey, so I decided to take on something simple and healthy. Make sure you add the egg on top of your avocado smash, which was probably the most generous one I've ever eaten. The whole wheat bread was a bit hard to bite, yet I somehow found myself enjoyed that chewiness.Packed pretty quickly even before brunch hours normally began. Suggest to sit at the counter next to the window to enjoy the street view. Don't order for delivery. Messed up my order and purposely hung up when I called FIVE times.Never ordering again. I've been here a couple of times already, and I would still come back. Although the place is small, tables are kind of cramped, this little Australian food spot does have some banging truffle fries. I come here and always get the truffle fries, they're just that damn good. Crunchy, truffly, potatoey, these are some legit fries. Last time I came here, I ordered the burger and split the fried chicken sandwich between another friend. Everyone I bring here always agree that the truffle fries are the best main thing here. Delicious avocado toast. Seriously, delicious. My bf got the ricotta pancakes which were a pleasant surprise. Soft and moist. We arrived around 10 on a Sunday and opted to sit at the bar since there was a tiny wait to be seated. There was outdoor seating and lower level seating as well. I appreciated the airy vibe although this place is a little small. The wait staff were super friendly. Definitely would recommend for Sunday brunch. Limited seating and slightly cramped but this hipster joint was a hit! It's not the friendliest nor the tastiest but it represents LES in a way that was quiet memorable/enjoyable. I'd definitely stop by brunch again when I'm back in town. Love this place! Great food and nice stuff, but there are not that much seats for big group. Hard to have a table during lunch time! Highly recommend crispy rice salad with egg! Great service, very attentive and brunch is beautifully adorned, filled with freshness and tastiness.I've been here over the past few years but what sparked me to write a review was when we came early this past Saturday (before 10am) and my friend had a small window to eat before she left town. I called in and they immediately answered they could take us in. The whole wait staff was swift, attentive, and took care of things with minimal disruption. And they served us my favorite Norwegian eggs benedict with salmon (the salad made with butterhead lettuce is so simple yet fresh) and kept on refilling our coffees despite how busy it was.I grew up in this area and will continue to keep returning, and this will be my spot to bring friends when they need a good eggs benedict brunch fix. So good. The food, the people working here and the atmosphere. This was our first breakfast in NYC and it was perfect. At first we were not that happy as we had to sit at the bar and as an introvert that's my nightmare, but it turned out good. The guy behind the bar was super nice and friendly. The food came out very fast and was delicious. My sister had the Ricotta Hotcakes and I had the Avocado on multi grain. I also had one of their housemade Sodas, which was very refreshing and not overly sweet. My Espresso was also very good. My sister loved the Hotcakes and her Cappuccino.When I'm back in NYC, I'll surely return to Dudleys. Nothing special. The wait is annoying, the service was below average, and the food was just okay. Trust the Aussies to serve up some amazing Sunday brunch.A very cute brunch spot and all-day cafe in Lower East Side with big, open street-facing windows. It's small so be prepared to wait if your party is larger than 2 people. The restaurant was lively and relaxed and I loved the waiters' matching beachy outfits. Prices were very reasonable, and staff were warm and friendly. My friend and I shared a Big Breakie, a classic English breakfast - two eggs and toast, bacon, mushroom, baked beans, tomatoes and a hash brown. The mushrooms and bakes beans were herby and perfectly seasoned. There were some pretty creative cocktails and beverages on the menu too. We went for iced matcha latte and basil watermelon juice. Both were very refreshing on a hot summer day.The real winner of our meal were the banana pancakes. They were so fluffy, soft and delicate. Definitely some of the best pancakes I've had in NYC and I definitely did not expect it from this cafe. It's the only dessert item on their menu so you can't miss it! (I've been comparing pictures and I think they made a different banana pancake for us - ours had ricotta (?) butter in substitute of the hazelnuts.)If you're looking for your next brunch spot, this is the place to be!",https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Jb6ReEM5_D8Cu--ZizT4xw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Og44VSJFKqEeZKDYNzTbtQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gr2n74WqYF6DD8hBQDnHng/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FOAXD1MthZTVhKDDIq49qw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KfySpZERghM9T2jDCAnPcw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/T0fmF2yGKmPqVoS5fmTnaw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DCkFYzBsE760FVjBqtO4MA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QxQV5x0FyhVrQKFUjiVt1w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9uH9eQ-6nXp3i5xHCK4RIQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/g1SP9DFuy-NSf6kubEciVg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Cv9eqhrqZnQeAUapuoEgQQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7i5hJ-Ho03YicifWYalmYQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xkHm1pEx803UnzbZNVqu-g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZFHbj_F4B0kwBENgFAYJkA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/57VudkQ_I0gCO5jkr3QATA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/t7BuJf7QXFr-owlL4S_VhQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1MtmBEaPTdz-P7YGXmSQ2w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VzQvkBrOABeHOwGEB7sn4w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NdVPVu10Z033soIKEVK6oQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OUA7PaJmpwz77GcivyR4cQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9o4QXsjJCh6pBUiHyHzzJw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-VNvim0r3-xi6lROMzTnxw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yOfxj4JufJS8pr18sqxTYg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FtpAhS-TpeZ9c1OmD4FHTQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GF3C5YXk0FfA8UoeoIsHZA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/w1RZvfJX1TWR3jzR-7zGHA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Z8myD4X66CBpwQ5tBSU9ag/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RDVxWTt4GFv6GsDG9ltytA/258s.jpg,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/eds-lobster-bar-new-york-3,eds-lobster-bar-new-york-3,New York,10002,NY,Seafood,Bars,American (Traditional),"Ok, obsessed with this place!!! The food is delicious!! Came here with a friend and we were totally blown away by this place. We had lobster bisque and the lobster rolls.The soup was a perfect, and that lobster roll melted in my mouth. Great service and cute ambiance. The place is tiny and gets pretty packed so try to come before 5pm to avoid waiting. I will definitely be back! OMG!!! Food is incredible! We had the lobster roll to share with the lobster ravioli! Not a big pasta person, but this plater is to die for! Not super friendly staff at first, but after few wine glasses who cares! During a visit to New York City for a few days recently, we investigated a few more dining establishments that offered lobster rolls on their menu. Ed's was one of those we visited. We walked to Ed's, which is on the south-side of Manhattan, and the restaurant can be characterized as a cozy, neighborhood site. The interior is relatively white, a bit rustic, but definitely inviting. We sat at the bar and ordered the lobster salad, lobster bisque, and lobster roll. The lobster salad was quite tasty, notably the vinaigrette, but was a bit lacking in lobster meat. The same could be said of the lobster bisque, which was tasty, but only included a couple of small, lobster-filled ravioli. The Maine version lobster roll was quite good and fresh-tasting. The only minor tweak is that the lobster salad was placed on top of the bun rather than nestled inside of it, which can be easily corrected. The taste of the lobster roll was quite spot-on. In addition, the service was good, the staff are friendly, and I'd return there to eat and hang out anytime. Ed's does it right and I wish they were in Tucson! Sidle up to the long bar, order a lobster roll, add a glass of white wine (Languedoc Franc), gaze at the wainscoting paneling and enjoy the tunes! It's a winning combo of elements. ""Hearts afire"" by Earth, Wind and Fire was playing the last time we were there and the combo of the smooth yacht rock and delicious, buttery lobster roll, crisp white wine was heaven. There's no nonsense waiting (at least not when I've ever been there) - staff is so good at being efficient, friendly but not annoying and food is quick and delicious every time. I've never been able to order anything other than the lobster roll, but the menu looks pretty great if you're feeling adventurous and want to try something like a lobster BLT, lobster ravioli or lobster burger. I say if it's not broke, why fix it? Clam chowder in my opinion, is the best soup to warm you up and bring you joy during the cold New Yorkwinter nights. The one served at Ed's Lobster Bar is hearty and delicious and if you couple it with the Lobster Mac N Cheese you are sure to be in heaven. Of course there was no way I'd visit withouttrying the Lobster Roll! The bun was hot and sweet which made it hard for me becauseIdidn't know ifI wanted to eat out the large lobster chunks and save the bun for last! Decent.  Typical, lousy, unfriendly NY service.  Ignore them.  The food is better than they are.  Take care of the poor service by tipping appropriately. Service was as cold as their clam chowder. Clam chowder had nothing but chunks of potatoes and wee bit of seafood pieces. The worst service in NYC Fantastic spot.  We had the sandwich, the soup, the whole lobster and the ravioli.   It was fantastic.  The beer in tap was a perfect pairing to the food.   Great place to sop in New York. Good, friendly, quick service. Really delicious lobster roll. It looks a bit small when it first comes, but it really is a generous along of lobster, big chunks, not too much mayo. Worth the $30. The flavor really stands out. The bun is also perfectly buttered, and the fries are fresh and crunchy. Intimate, casual, tiny, well lite, clean, good food Cocktail sauce was perfect, heavy on the horseradish:) Good jams too. It's a total 4 star experience. The clam chowder and the bisque have 5 star presentation but is only 4 star flavor. Is there a dress code up in here? I'm not sure if I'm in Manhattan or on Martha's Vineyard. If you wear Vineyard Vines you'll fit right in. We super appreciated the lobster roll. The bun was just yum as was the lobster. Finished with a bang. I love Lobster Bar! The lobster, the calamari and the creme brle was all amazing. I randomly found this place by walking by and was so impressed. I would definitely come back here. It was a priced a little high, but the food and ambience was definitely worth it. It was worth the trip for sure! Super service. Exquisite lobster bisque--just the right consistency too. Lobster Cobb-- great flavor but not enough lobster for the price. House brewed ice tea-- perfect! Fantastic meal. Lobster roll was good. Fries and drinks were good but the whole lobster and the oysters and clams were really amazing. Also the Caesar salad was one of the tastiest we've had in a while! I absolutely love Eds lobster bar. The service was great, however it was a bit busy when I went so the food came out a bit slow. I wasn't a huge fan of the baked clams appetizer but my dad loved it. As my entree I got the broiled lobster with a side of fries and cole slaw. IT WAS THE BEST LOBSTER IVE HAD IN YEARS! For dessert I had the blueberry creme brle which was amazing, creme brle is one of my favorite desserts. I'm still craving the food from here and I will definitely be back! Small, cosy, cute little gem.My to go place when in Soho and it's dinner time :)Here I had my first lobster roll and so far is the best I've ever experienced. It is indeed pricey, like Hamptons pricey. I guess your alternative though is to cook the lobster yourself though, because it's not that other lobster restaurants are so cheaper.Also the french fries are crisp, thin, perfect. Lobster bisque... I thought I was in paradise when I had it. I can't compare with any other lobster bisque but this one is solid. A couple of notes... It's served with 1-2 lobster small ravioli... I would increase the number! How about a perfect magic 3?! Tends to be on the tasty end, I would bring it down a notch.As far as service, I was always treated nicely. The staff is never pushy or on top of you, witch I appreciate. Wonderful lobster rolls!! While they will set you backs pretty penny, the flavor and serving size is totally worth it. The lobster roll was heaping with lobster and the bun it's served on is buttery, soft &amp; slightly crisp on the outside. A+ lobster roll!It comes with fries or a salad and if you're REALLY craving it, they can also give you some very tasty cole slaw. If you like Fish shack type seafood and Lobster Rolls this is the place. The Lobster Roll is expensive  $30. It comes with French Fries and a small salad. You will get a decent size roll with big chunks of lobster. It's also served only one way plain with a little butter. I found it to be a touch under season. Same with the New England Clam Chowder. Just a little under season. The Fries are very good. They're nicely fried. Can you really go wrong with a lobster roll? Yep, by drudging it in mayonnaise. This lobster roll let the lobster speak for itself, with limited (any?) mayo and a few chives. The lobster sat on a warm, buttery roll. Served with fries, pickles, and a side salad. My partner ordered the fish and chips and felt they were average...but honestly who orders fish when you can have lobster? Really nice restaurant with good service. I just happened to pass by here, and decided on the lobster ravioli. The sauce was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. The bar seating is super convenient, but they also have tables. Everyone was very friendly and it was clean. I did not expect to have such an amazing meal. Thanks! Pricey and not worth it. I came here with a last minute tinder date and we ordered the lobster roll with salad and the lobster ravioli with chunks of mushroom because I wanted to try it both. Was this a good choice? This joint was packed even though we went near closing. The service speed was still decent.I was so excited for the lobster ravioli and that was the most disappointing part. There was an abundant amount of sauce but there was barely any taste to it. Their choice of mushrooms was odd and I'm not even sure why there were mushrooms. It seems like they just added that randomly. As for the lobster roll, they seemed so generous on the amount of lobster but it was also lacking flavor.",https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/F2OtI0iiJj0CnudYP47sFA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/znSWFrUyd77LpT9T75LJfA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/21UUoGO7LYUFkSk3xL5zLA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Iq6jGKD6Rtcrtf-W8h2CVQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uc6Zz6qEh5kilzDLIfw5-A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vTlqbkZmQrMNKC9KLlsvYQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VTe0Ll2x5I8sm-3bGEO36w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nmrcuLln9Cyp-0Sk3sVfgw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YSNgb_T4Tk4NxL0OkPoW8A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FvLb9ZXXoBofkUCk6GHmiw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UTD0WG13Xv8WSfGFdrv6pA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hKll8YJqOgjQtijCLadBwQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RvuHyHquupfNp7YblDdq2Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zkUh61w4HKdWjJcUunDLOg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ySr9CjEPjFZxxvs7q3xMFw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZOquz3-Vi7FVTGDtlL55EQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Ks2RfN3YP3lRq_PeTSnoPQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/e7PKfiOH2Gvwsv5Xh8rHLg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/iQZ98N7TsZDF_Ab5Ga8kzw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hLfxsdWdFwJRaflcjxErZA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HCrGsdLGD8Qc34_BC3_8_w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_Wjdm3zqGVw0ot9-sIO68w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/byn-BBxazAjONXiSppPgcQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IkXcR7811D8n34eTD405LQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oFKFR1bP5ImkyUbmDP85AA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/igQkE_Ozbrf_4iJhyNgVgQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-evGKPGLZLjMvBhS0lmu8Q/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/egg-shop-new-york-3,egg-shop-new-york-3,New York,10002,NY,Breakfast & Brunch,Sandwiches,NA,"Came here once while walking around. Saw that one of my friends came here before and said it was good. Plus my boyfriend and I both love eggs, so we stopped by during lunch.We were both in love with the dishes we ordered. The flavors were spot on, not too salty, not bland at all, just the right amount of seasonings that brings out the flavors of the dish.Wanted to go back again, but they were closed because of an event, but we will definitely be stopping by again in the near future. #OVERRATED...save your $$, don't come here. The food here is average. I'm surprised with all of the 5 star reviews because the food was so basic and average that you can basically make it on your own. The bread to the sandwich also seemed like it was bought from a shitty supermarket like Shoprite. Stiff and maybe expired? The people here seem like they hate their life too. When walking in, the girl at the bartender glared at me. She brought over my drink with a resting bitch face. Really confused.The male waiter barely checked up on our table. He took our order and then gave us our check. where were you in the in-between? SMH Had about an hour wait on a Sunday for brunch for 4 people. They don't take phone numbers so you have to time it right if you don't want to wait around for the whole time. The place is very small and cozy (maybe a bit cramped). I had the sausage egg and cheese sandwich with homemade biscuits - the sausage was delicious but overall the dish was a bit dry, it could use some kind of sauce. My friends got the BLT Benedict (poached eggs, bacon on brioche) the El Camino (poached egg, avocado, pulled pork, salsa), and the signature BEC. I thought the BLT was really moist and flavorful, and the other dishes had unique flavors too. Overall a nice ambiance with a simple breakfast with some cellent varieties. I wanted to eat at this place before we headed to the airport. Tiny shop, but I was able to get a seating at the counter. I ordered:- Chai French Toast($12) - dark chocolate ganache, fresh berries, Fuji apple, and maple syrup. Love the texture of the french toast. - Spandex Salad ($13) - poached egg, miso quinoa, mixed greens, avocado, pickled carrots, puffed amaranth, roasted pumpkin seed, mustard seed, goji berry, and tamari. Simply delicious and hearty. Service was so so, but the food made up for it. Would love to come back and try other things on the menu next time. I hope you give this place a try. Cheers! Cute &amp; trendy little (physically very small tables/seating situation) breakfast/brunch/lunch place.  The menu is largely egg-based (though I'm sure you've realized this from the name).I tried the Pepper Boy in a bell pepper (as opposed to a panini roll), and enjoyed it but would have like to see more peppers aside from green bell peppers (they were chopped up in the egg mix and everything was served in a green pepper as well - also they were a bit undercooked).  2 friends had the benedict and said that it was non-traditional but very good. I really wanted the freshly squeezed watermelon juice but they were out so I tried the Turmeric Tonic (non-alcoholic, tastes like a lemonade with turmeric and sprinkled with cracked black pepper - more on the sweet side).  Awesome playlist which reminded me of my Seattle college jams (Pains of Being Pure at Heart, Death Cab for Cutie, etc.). Had to wait 30-40 minutes for a group of 4 to be seated, but there's a cute and highly rated coffee shop next door if you need to kill time. Overall, not worth the hype or wait. Wasn't a huge fan of the steak and eggs- surprisingly too acidic and really spicy! The avo and eggs was underwhelming. I wish the bread was thicker and more artisan tasting- it seemed like your run of the mill seeded whole grain from the grocery store. I did enjoy the chili oil that accompanied the dish. The biscuit side WAS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. Possibly the best biscuit I've ever had, and I absolutely LOVED the orange marmalade it was served with. $40 for two sandwiches, a biscuit, and a tea. Not too bad at all. We went around 3pm on a Sunday and waited around 25 minutes for a table of two. The staff is friendly and atmosphere is cozy and cute, but I probably wouldn't wait again though. Came during the weekend for brunch and the wait was ridiculous for 2 people. It was over a hour wait but we got lucky because a party of 2 just left and we were seated right away. Everyone else was waiting for a larger table. The restaurant is very tiny and you have to wait outside to be called. The menu is plain and simple. I had the steak and egg ($15) which came with a sunny side up egg. I substituted the egg with a soft scramble and it was the best decision ever. Although it was an extra $2, it was the fluffiest scrambled egg I have ever had. Also had the hashbrowns for $4 and that wasn't good at all. It came with two pieces and it was hard and didn't taste good. You can save your money and skip this. It is a little pricey for just a sandwich but it is worth trying. Should definitely get the soft scramble! I had brunch here with 3 of my friends after having this place bookmarked for so long and it was so worth it!We ordered the hash browns to share and they were cooked to perfect crispness and seasoned deliciously.I ordered the spandex which not only looked super cute but also tasted amazing, was packed with flavor, and super filling, but in a light airy way rather than that gross over stuffed feeling. Portion sizes of everything were perfect and we were all extremely satisfied with our food. We also ordered the chai French toast for the table, which I was a little apprehensive about being that it's not an egg item like the egg shop specializes in but it turned out to be SO GOOD!! The chocolate was a nice, thin consistency that didn't make it feel too heavy and it wasn't overly sweet or tart either. The French toast was also a nice portion size and perfect for sharing. As for the decor, it was super cute, I loved the cozy diner feel and they had cute little eggs printed on the napkins. Even the bill comes with a cute egg post card. The service was timely and the prices were decent as well, I can't wait to come back!! This is a small cozy popular brunch place in the Chinatown/Nolita area that as you might have guessed, serves eggs as the main attraction of its entrees.The wait can be long if you don't get there early, but Cafe Integral is right next door and the hostess will walk over to call out names if you choose to wait there.  My friend and I each ordered hot tea (Harney and Sons!) to go along with our sandwiches. I ordered the B.L.T. Benedict while my friend ordered the sausage egg and cheese on a buttermilk biscuit.  My ""sandwich"" was an open faced sandwich and although it was good, it was quiet pricey for the portion.  The scrambled eggs here look good and I would come back again to try the other items on the menu! Wow let's talk about avocado toast.  I've tried it just about everywhere you could imagine but this particular toast was just spectacular.  Heirloom yellow and green tomatoes, seedy bread, poached eggs - what more could you ask for?  It's quite small in here so try and find a time that's not so popular - 2:00 on a Friday afternoon was perfect for me.  It's cozy, inviting and such a sweet little spot.  It's definitely worth every penny! Great food, but relatively pricey (typical Manhattan), tiny inside, very loud, and only average service.The wait was already 30 min at 10am in the morning on a Saturday. Took forever for the hostess to put our names down on the list. Inside is cute and chic, but very tiny (there is in fact a tiny bathroom, much to my surprise I don't know how they fit it in there). Inside service was good, the food came relatively fast and was delicious. I like that even the regular tap water they give you a small pitcher with lemon and mint. Because it's so tiny inside, it's pretty loud, and while it's a cute date spot it is impossible to hear yourself think in there.We ordered the Pepper Boy sandwich ($13) and the Hot Chix sandwich ($14) - both delicious. Very filling, we didn't even need sides or appetizers. Would definitely consider coming here again, if it wasn't so ridiculously crowded on the weekend. Came here on a cold winter day. Irregardless of weather, brunch lines are always long. I remember squeezing in the makeshift vestibule with my boyfriend, impatiently waiting to be sat to a) satiate our hunger and b) be able to have feeling in our hands again.Came here because I love eggs. Obviously. And because this place is aesthetic AF. Would I come back? Potentially. The menu was overpriced (welcome to brunch in NY) but the food wasn't REMARKABLE. I wish I remember what I got but it was pretty good. I would definitely give this place another try. Gimmee all the huevos! Okay don't get me wrong, this place is cute as can be. I am also a sucker for ""fancy water."" I'm not a fancy gal but I loved the cucumber lemon water they bring to the table. However, I feel like Egg Shop is a bit lacking food wise.We had the brunchkins (donut holes), an egg scrambler, and the avo and egg sandwich (basically toast).Everything needed salt and hot sauce. Plus $3 to add avocado...what??? The bacon bread pudding brunchkins were dry and tasted burnt. I LOVE sweets and I ate half of one. So that's saying a lot. Lastly, service was slow and kind of weird. Our waitress kept disappearing and the bus boy seemed peeved that we didn't eat the brunchkins. However, I would come back for an egg sandwich. I heard the biscuits are craze amaze too. Hoping to come back and redo this review. I enjoy, I enjoy, I enjoy dem eggs!! I knew that I would enjoy this place, because of the name alone. I got the Everything to Me and it was so good!! They didn't have unlimited drinks, but the drink we did have was pretty good. It was the Watermelon Margarita, unfortunately, don't have frozen margaritas at this location. They have it at the Williamsburg location. The things that I wish did happen: Not waiting outside for an hour and 15 mins (it was very hot that day) and we couldn't walk around, so we had to stay. It was a pretty small place, so we had to deal with it the best we could. I am giving it a 4/5 because of the service and the food. The waiter that we had was super sweet and I really enjoyed the meal that I got. If I were you, I would ask the size of the meal. My friend got Avo &amp; Egg and it was pretty small, she also got hashbrowns as well. And it is pretty pricey, so I would check out which meal can give you more than less. I would definitely go back!! After hearing much hype I decided to finally check out the EggShop! It's definitely a really cute brunch spot! The space is small and intimate, and service was timely. We came during lunch (about 1pm) and the wait was around 20 min. I had the BLT and my boyfriend had the steak sandwich. I really liked my BLT, finished it off to the last bite. The steak &amp; eggs (it was a sandwich) was also tasty, seemed a little small though. I also order the grapefruit juice, which was delicious and prob my favorite part about the meal. In all honesty though, yes the food was good but I don't think it was worth the price or all the hype. The restaurant itself was very pretty and picture perfect, which is were most of the hype comes from I believe. Overall- EggShop was nice and I'm happy I went once. But I don't think I will recommend or come back. There are a ton of better brunch places around the city. What a great way to end 2017!I've been to the Egg Shop before, but two years ago and I remember it being pretty good. My boyfriend has never been and had wanted to try it for awhile so we decided to brave the cold and come here NYE for brunch. We both ordered a coffee with almond milk (they charged us each $1 more for almond milk which I thought was a little much, I can buy a whole carton of almond milk at trader joes with $2...this is where the 1 star off is for)I ordered the chai french toast, it came with blueberries, apples and chocolate. The french toast was soft and buttery. It was delicious however I didn't really taste any chai flavors.My boyfriend got the BLT eggs Benedict. It was on a piece of brioche toast. The bacon was maple bacon and there was this delicious creamy  sauce on top. I recommend both of the dishes we got. I thought they were delicious. The wait wasn't too bad either, we waited for about 20 mins (we arrived at 12pm). I also do not suggest coming here with a large group it takes a lot longer to get seated. Most people were coming as a group of 2 or 3. This is a very small restaurant! Arrived at this cute brunch spot and waited about 30 minutes for a table for 3. What does one order at a restaurant called egg shop? I debated between their chicken sandwich and an egg sandwich and decided to go with the obvious choice. I ended up creating my own sandwich (scrambled eggs, avocado, bacon and chimichurri sauce in between their homemade biscuit). My sandwich was pretty hard to eat since the biscuit kept falling apart. If I ever come back, I would get it on a panini instead or probably just get their chicken sandwich. Overall, my breakfast sandwich was just okay. It was a bit bland so I had to drench it with hot sauce, which is conveniently provided on the table.We also ordered two pieces of fried chicken ($7 each, kind of pricey) and a order of hash browns ($4 for 2 pieces) to share amongst our table. The two pieces of fried chicken were inconsistent. One was noticeably bigger than the other piece and also more burnt. However, the fried chicken was my favorite part of the meal. It was both dark meat pieces, boneless and super juicy! Not really sure how this place is so highly ranked. There wasn't a single dish our table ordered that we enjoyed or that was cooked properly. The BLT Benedict? They hadn't let the excess water off the egg and so there was water on the toast making the sandwich all soggy. The eggs in an omelette we ordered was cooked to mush and we could barely take two bites of it. The spandex was decent but bland and not worth $13. For a place with the word egg in the name you'd think they'd know how to cook eggs properly Let me start by saying the food is excellent, but very pricey.  I am very angry because I ordered through seamless and when I went to check the status of my order (because it had been so late) Seamless said it had been delivered at 1:41PM (order had been placed at 12:48PM).  The thing is I had not yet received my order. So, I called the Egg Shop. They transferred me to the rudest woman who said, ""we don't do deliveries, it was an outside source who placed the order"". She was BEYOND rude.  So I contacted Seamless and each person I spoke with was equally uncooperative. Finally the delivery guy called me, he was at the wrong building somehow.  The food was good, but not worth the bad delivery service, I received my order at 2:06PM.  I do not understand the rudeness of the manager.  Really no excuse for that. There's nothing more perfect than a delicious egg sandwich for brunch.The Egg Shop B.E.C. is sooo good! Perfectly, cooked runny egg with savory bacon and cheese, all sandwiched between a warm panini roll - what more could you ask for? It's very well portioned, but had I had more room in my stomach, I definitely would have eaten two of these! I'd probably rank this egg sandwich among the top 3 egg sandwiches I've ever had in my life.We also got a the Fried Chicken side which is great for two people to share. Great crunch and moist interior - would highly recommend as an addition to your main dish.We did have to wait around 20 minutes for a table, which wasn't too bad, but we over heard that some of the larger groups had to wait around an hour.",https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jW0n1BRH0YECCMGR5gMOYQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gzD7-2zfZZ00BELMM25SZA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RJzXrTQ8IG0sEjIuoSEpKQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/swroC2EurwragTmXkZGtmw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6b3WVFahnMSZj2YPMRo4aA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JsrKxauUMqodJZ7Otj0AcQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/btGS3G6YrIkYnnq730EcQw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vIbrtgL7cnLx0RI_kwszpw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ovS4Z_kP2tSPYIeBPzuTBg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bV8KUZWjPeiaM1TcV3GgMg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LjgPqX1qi4j-Xzm9TJ0PDQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ffME6ZBV0lPBcy1OjqyoiQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/X6a-N2zvTKgayQceggykLw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/y5uUwaUZKXTJvQ-XgYgmvA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YRilYOL4QSwjKImCaXXj9w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/T6wFCFCEnPCmrtAAjWRwaQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fSB7mEWo4dSIEr1pvt8SUw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RUHsEW3ZfTzkN4DTXSIUeA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vrSdNknv4NxEUXWlRut_Kw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/D13NfWamxcB7omx3-hyPww/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DlpwALS9WXwSSevtERLBhw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bX-nXo-R5B-LKi7zD1Y8Sw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kCkrMJOP8VE-W9W6m0R2kQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GxNblIy5hep-GzCUU3VJNA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yoFPvOoHX-LfzsaAbBKRfg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FIUekVkMML-kVgI0GuDGPw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tC7ZaLxZOSpg0G1Okz9xsg/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/empanada-mama-l-e-s-new-york,empanada-mama-l-e-s-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Colombian,Empanadas,NA,"Empanadas Mamas is a 24/7 Columbian restaurant and it's an ideal place for late night [dr]munchies. They also serve alcohol. I am coming back here for my late night hunger pangs.Service is fast and friendly. The venue can accommodate varying group sizes.Empanadas were all fresh, I ordered:Cheese and broccoli - my favorite out of what i ordered, gooey, fatty, with the taste of subtle cheese and broccoliKorean beef - nicely marinatedBBQ pulled pork - I'm not a huge fan, but I thought it was done rightViagra - this ended up being a seafood empanada. There were no pleasant after effects :( I went to their other location almost 5 years ago and I've finally returned after a late night of karaoke. This place is open 24/7, so it was perfect for late night munchies. I had the opportunity to try several empanadas ranked in the order of enjoyment. Broccoli and cheese - surprisingly my favorite of them all. Korean beef - meat is super flavor BBQ pulled pork - excellent flavor Chorizo - too dry, too much meat. needs more flavoringViagra - tasted a bit fishy.Empanadas all came fresh and I wasn't disappointed at all. This place also has gluten-free options like the corn tortillas that were just as every bit delicious! Certainly don't plan on waiting that long again to try this place again. Came here at around 5:50am, so dining in was no longer an option. BUT they so graciously let me order take-out and stay in. Big ups for that because I would've had to find somewhere to eat my empanada outside in the freezing cold if they kicked me out. Ordered the desayuno colombiano for $4.09, including tax. It was good :). Probably the first time I had an empanada, twas a good first time.Recommend the place if you're drunk and you need something to eat. Super friendly staff. Good eats. I can't help but have somewhat of a terrible feeling about a restaurant after 2 unusually rude staffed Friday nite/ sat morning attempted delivery orders that for silly reasons couldn't go through and never got delivered to me. The manager Tommy was pretty nice at attempting to resolve the issues, both times.  He offered me a credit which was impossible to use when I attempted to place an order last night.  They had told me the manager left for Turkey for a month...hmmm ok.  So finally when I called back today, he was definitely here in NYC and remedied it.  However that was after many phone calls to 2 managers uptown location bd downtown...and an email and picture of the times I called and picture of the credit in the email. However 2 times of bad service back to back does leave a bad taste in my mouth. I've been a loyal fan of their food forever and love the empanadas, oxtail sopa, chicharones, etc....I'm just not sure that having these issues, the staff probly hating me....if they are going to spit in my food from now on or not.  This is my concern and I can't be 100% certain that they won't.  I've totally worked in food service before for many years and I know that type of stuff does happen when you hate the customer. I was in the mood  for some  empanadas came to this place and was overwhelmed with all the options. I loved the creativeness with the names and they chose and pairings  for each one. I had the cheesesteak and pepperoni both decent. Also had carne sudada it was a little burnt but not bad. I would probably try this place again but just for the empanadas. My boyfriend quite literally stumbled upon this spot as we were exploring the lower east side's night life. I'm sure it helped that we were a couple drinks in, but both of us couldn't stop raving about these empanadas! The ones we got had a cornmealy crust that really blew our minds. The meat was tender and the sauce - delicious! This spot is forever bookmarked as one of our must-gos for whenever we're back in NY. Good late night drunk empanada spot. It's 24hrs which is perfect for drunken late night eats. The empanadas are super expensive compared to other places. The taste is there but it's not super authentic. They have other food options but i would stick to just ordering the empanadas.Service is always slow and bad, reason why they get 3 stars. I don't blame them tho, it's 24hrs. I wouldn't be too happy working there knowing it'll NEVER close. Lol Order the chicken empanada or the cheese! GOOD LUCK! Haven't been here in a while and was confused that they now have a new location. I thought I was going crazy! The new location is nice but it no longer caters to those who want a late night snack without waiter service. You either order to go and go or sit at a table with waiter service. Brazil- my fav. Amazing juicy beef and flavor. A must try. Chorizo-found it a bit dry. Lots of meat but def my least fav. Reggaeton- one of my go-tos only down side is sometimes the pork is dry but the teen sauce helps with that.El bandito- a recent newbie for me. Moist beef and nice mole flavorClearly times have changed but I think I will always be a fan. If it's fried and covered in dough, chances are I'm going to love it, regardless. That being said, the empanadas here are more delicious than I expected. The Hawaiian empanada is worth 5 stars all on its own. The grilled pineapple has a delicious light cinnamon aftertaste that really makes it stand out from your average empanada.I also tried the Colombian breakfast with skirt steak and I loooved the seasoning of the steak. This is not your average steak and eggs breakfast. This is hardcore deliciousness in full effect. My friend brought us here for a quick dinner because the restaurant that we wanted to eat at was closed. We had the guacamole and plantains and about 11 different kinds of empanadas. The empanadas range from 3.30-3.55 and there are all kinds of options for both the filling and empanada exterior (regular, baked, and corn). Our favorites were the brasil, shredded beef, shredded chicken, korean bbq, and mushroom. The guacamole was a decent portion but lacked acidity and flavor. Overall the empanadas were solid and there are a lot of different options. They also do free deliveries! My only issue was that I glanced over the check and noticed that they automatically added gratuity to our check without telling us and we only had 3 people for dinner. I don't know if they do that often and really hope they don't, but I only noticed because I've worked in a restaurant before and always check my receipts first. If you're craving empanadas of any variety, this is the place to go. Empanada mama has an enormous menu with choices to suit your taste. I had the Brazil, chili and beef, and shredded chicken empanadas along with the yucca chips with delicious guacamole dip. The chips were perfect for sharing among a large group - my party of three shared and we still had some left over. My favorite empanada that I tried was probably the chili and beef, although I enjoyed the exterior of the Brazil one more. I liked the spiciness of the chili and beef though. The Brazil tasted too much of olive for me, which was my fault for ordering it because it did say olive in the menu. I just didn't anticipate the flavor of them being so strong. I also tried the viagra empanada (yes that is actually the name), and I really enjoyed the flavors. The interior of the restaurant was spacious and it would be good for larger groups. When I came here around 1:30pm it was pretty empty as well. Final thoughts - Empanada Mama is a satisfying stop that has a plethora of choices to suit any taste. I would definitely come back here to try more flavors! It will definitely take a few visits to try everything that caught my eye. This is literally my favorite restaurant... but y'all take 1 hour longer than listed to deliver food i order. I understand if you deliver food 24 hours then it may not be perfect. But don't tell me it's gonna be delivered at 11:35 if it ends up being delivered at 12:35... it's actually the difference between me staying awake or going to sleep. It's mad frustrating that a restaurant i believe in so deeply consistently disappoints me with false promises. However, that Cassava empanada is legit life changing. Ok ..I've now been to this location several times for either dine in or take out. If you like empanadas- this is the place for you! I consider this style of empanada Puerto Rican. I've had Colombian empanadas but they are very different than these- they usually have a more golden color to them Normally - meat are the traditional empanada. I've seen family do cheese but this place makes it all LOLIf you like seafood- then the "" Viagra"" one is for you - and in my opinion THE BEST one here. ""Brazil"" is the more traditional empanada and is my 2nd choiceThe Reggaeton - is rice, beans and pork The spicy chicken is pretty good too.I like to try different things sometimes but it's so hard when you love the Viagra empanadas lol I've tried the jerk chicken empanadas special and was EH. Don't see myself getting it again.There are two sauces available- one is a green sauce that has a cilantro taste to it and is more mild. The other is a red picante sauce. I like both My one friend swears that she likes the food at the Hells Kitchen location better ( they re-opened it since the fire). I'm indifferent to it. I think it's the same. This was my favorite restaurant when it was in HK. I have no idea what happened but the service here is strange and abusive. Their new mantra is: You didn't order that? Too bad, you're paying for it. You ordered something else? You're paying for that, too and you can wait 40 mins and miss your movie.Recently, we were seeing a show in the area and ordered some empanadas and an entree to share. We thought it was strange they brought out the rice first, but we figured it was tapas style where they bring it out as it's ready. WRONG! the waitress told us she put in the wrong order. Ok... but can we have the food we ordered? The grey haired man says that they're busy now so, ""if we still want it, it will be 40 mins."" Huh? No apology, quite the contrary. We received a nasty attitude.We ask for the check and not a blessed thing was removed for our trouble. Not even the garbage rice that we didn't eat because it was ice cold! We were still hungry but couldn't eat because we had to get to the show.I will never come back here. I am offended and, actually, kind of hurt because I was a good customer of their HK location for nearly a decade before it closed. TLDR: open 24/7; good alternative to pizza for a late night snackI live dangerously close to this Empanada Mama and inevitably stop in to order empanadas to go after a night out or whenever I'm craving a snack vs. a meal. I find that two empanadas are the perfect late night snack fix. My personal favorite is the Korean beef, which has a crispy, flakey shell and is filled with savory, sweet, shredded beef and scallions.Takeout orders typically take 10 minutes or so (which can be agonizing when you're hungry after a long night out) and are called out by order number. Each empanada is wrapped and labeled individually so that there aren't any mixups if you're ordering with friends. The empanadas are served with a red sauce (which I don't like) and a green sauce (which is amazing).While the staff isn't particularly friendly (I was once chastised for sitting at an empty table that was clearly going to remain empty given how empty the restaurant was while waiting for my takeout order), the delicious empanadas and green sauce compensate for this. Empanada Mama is definitely a place to visit for after work fun or after the club eats! I ventured here for a Meet-Up group happy hour. We were seated immediately around 5:30 PM which I think is perfect timing; Any later and you'll see that it gets really packed, but luckily this place is open 24 hours.Happy hour is not that great honestly. For a place that prides itself on its empanada variety, you would expect that they would at least have some happy hour deals on them but the only thing that that is offered are drinks. BUT, let me say that the drains are extremely good! I decided to have a white sangria and after a few sips, I was tipsy. It tastes really good but its a sneaky drink. Be sure to order it, if you decide to dine. Now for the main event, the empanadas! I ordered one of each type; Empanada Mama offers wheat flour, corn flour, and oven baked empanadas. I opted for the ""reggaeton"",  shredded chicken, ground beef, and traditional cheese. The Reggaetn was not as spectacular as I had envisioned or hoped it to be based on the reviews, but it was decent. The shredded chicken had to be the worst I have ever had. It was extremely dry and flavorless. The ground beef and the traditional cheese were A+ on my list though. They were both made very well with a crispy shell, savory ingredients, and a great blend of seasoning. We also had an order of guacamole, which was alright, it could've used some salt-and-pepper.Service was really good. The waitress was very attentive and helpful with all of our inquiries. The same goes for the bus boys and other staff members, we had no issues. I definitely recommend  trying out this place, especially if you're in the neighborhood. It's relatively inexpensive and a good place for groups to catch up and eat. otherwise, I won't be running to return here as it wasn't that memorable. The delivery time is okay, but I need to talk about this real quick. The empanadas were pretty good - they were all varying temperature degrees. One was cold, one was lukewarm, another was decently hot. Not too sure what happened there, but I don't care about that. It's your delivery service that I take issue with.My building has no intercom so I have to go downstairs when I order delivery. When I opened the front door, I thanked the delivery guy as I usually do. But instead of just making usual conversation like others do, this guy opened the door all the way despite me just trying to get the bag, leaned forward to hug me and kiss me on the cheek. That is a solid no, especially after midnight when I'm alone downstairs. I understand if your staff is trying to be friendly, but this goes beyond that because I didn't know what was going on and I have never had this happen to me in 8 years of ordering delivery from any restaurant. Please speak with your staff about proper conduct with customers, especially since most people are uncomfortable with physical contact from strangers. I've passed by this place many times and always wanted to try the empanadas here. I was overwhelmed by the menu choices for empanadas. I did not know they offer so many different flavors and combinations! Everything in the menu sounded good. I took about 5-8 mins just looking at the menu because I couldn't decide what to get. The price is decent for empanadas. I ended up getting the BBQ pulled pork, beef, shredded pork and cheese steak. When I ordered I didn't realize they have a seasonal menu for empanadas :(. I ordered take out and it took about 10 minutes for the food to be ready. The empanadas looked small but it was pretty filling after 2. The green sauce is so good. The beef and the pork is pretty dry so you definitely needed the green sauce it hot sauce. The BBQ pork was pretty good but I would have liked it in the wheat flour. The cheese steak was good. That was the best one. The BBQ pork and cheese steak is good without the sauces. I would definitely come back here again to try the other empanadas on the menu. Only ordered 2 of the Viagra empanadas to go but they were delicious and filling. I ate here to compare the Viagra empanadas that I had at the Empanada Mama in Midtown and I'm glad to say that they're pretty similar in taste (though the ones in Midtown tasted slightly fresher).The cashier was friendly and helpful. The empanadas came out in about 5 to 10 minutes, so overall I had a great experience. Looking forward to their other flavors! Awesome service! Order quickly to go! I ordered 16 different kinds and it was ready in 10 minutes! I also got a courtesy call! They also have Viagra in a corn masa!!!! DELICIOUS!",https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yElU-b2xPoiUq839pKKgPA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UAnrU_H-3Hh8BQqxdmEgWQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wtjQMlHW7Ah5c3xdO6zAZA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4_sugv_T6syGiJFkwFzP-Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6Ulq-B006qMWb4_65GCzWA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qY-h84EtGgVFPwH6aL4c7Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nyIO_2mNtbMwU-Ev2xsVqg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/E9rRViS6NxsOSuqa8rsg6w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kYj2lL_c3zvdPFC9oxfEzg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lfPB3nu7ZfI1SXNk5cXCHQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/b47x6FIZ4FkmGCmxLayYJw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dzKjigYSnrQWDbYMooF81A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/T1_XlpEPhBT02JXr8RVKcw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/54VJ38riwieFRQg7qsK0Jw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9rrXWGKFMdekzPvoqjqsbQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/a0T2qL31LCVdAJjrkNIeUw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WvMEQn9F2o-tSweNE4x0vg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RBjvtXp5OupdFtxgGSCTjQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/y1WygrPCl9P5X2rwDl453A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Mg1hZs8pi7kJgf9ZjLqzjQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/d14BsmZrg8-pSeqE79GlVQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LMKrnIVuCbpoKmULoi5kmQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VkAsW8bM2wH8tuDCBYJX5A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xyAbGvZY3-K-3rsvAawmHQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xJITg9F7ZTSiyZ54w4DLWA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AYd3Xgk6OIlgHq-nTbxAGg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DgwUivSVvNpSH5y9JHFZOQ/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/erin-mckennas-bakery-new-york,erin-mckennas-bakery-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Bakeries,Vegan,Gluten-Free,"The best gluten free cupcakes and treats!Delicious, not heavy or sugary treats that I recommend to all who are gluten free / vegan.One of my fav places to visit when I come to NY as the cupcakes are delish and priced well compared to other places in NY that offer gluten free treats. The donuts here are really really great. It's almost beside the point to say that they're gluten free and vegan. Cinnamon sugar, mocha, cookies and cream. All delicious. And the bakery itself is warm, lovely, and filled with delectable smells. I expected more. This place has so many great reviews but my experience was super underwhelming. There were plenty of choices that looked delicious: vegan cupcakes, tea cakes/loaves, and donuts. I went with the lemon blueberry scone. BIG mistake. It tasted nothing like a scone. It was a soggy mess that reminded me more of a slice of cake than a dry and crumbly scone. The icing didn't redeem it either; I could find the blueberries but I barely tasted the lemon. It felt like a waste of money and I immediately regretted not choosing something different. The bakery itself is also tiny (read: hole in the wall). There are some stools and window benches but in general, it feels a bit drab and old. It wasn't clear if they offered other items, such as coffee, because their signs weren't the best or were nonexistent. Maybe everything they make is great and I just got the one bad option. And I hope this is the case . . . but from what I tried by itself, I'm angry I even went. I ordered a chocolate cake with vanilla frosting. I called in my order and didnt meet the minimum advance notice time but the person on the phone was very nice and accomodating. The cake had a very thick consistency. Everyone enjoyed the cake. I especially liked the frosting! We found a veggan gluten free bakery in the city.  Must go check it out.   Walked in cute cozy ambiance. Lady behind the counter had no intentions in helping us.  So we just ordered what we wanted.Cran-apple bread- moist and there's actual chucks of fruits in the bread.  Very good and not too sweet.Carrot bread- moist and chucks of carrot.   Very good. Oatmeal raisin cookie- was very good but the cookie was so thin.  It fell apart itself. Overall good quality bread but service Definitely needs to be improved.  Would only go back for their bread as they have good selections of it. 3 stars is only for the bread. This place is decent. I ordered a red velvet cupcake, and it wasn't amazing but it wasn't bad either - just good. Vegan desserts are always a hit or miss for me, and I liked that they had a wide range of baked goods.This place is certified kosher so that's a plus. The bakery was very cutesy, with the decor and the music. Worth checking out! The girls that work in here are great! Super friendly and full of smiles when you walk in. Almost doesn't feel like you're in NY. ;-) My kiddo wasn't a fan of the big cranberry chunks in the jam on the cream and jam biscuit but I scraped it and then he ate it but meh he's a kid. They have a good selection of donuts, breads, biscuits, cupcakes and cakes. They are vegan, soy, but (only have coconut) and gluten free which is amazing! Prices are not bad considering they are a specialty bakery. I got about 5 different items for around $20.  If we are ever in NY we will be back! I only gave it a 4 because there is hardly any seating, no tables and I didn't see a restroom either. Which may have been tucked away in the back somewhere but that seems to be the norm out here. Erin McKenna's BabyCakes, Sugar Sweet Sunshine, and Two Little Red Hens all have that same comforting, homey nooks-and-crannies ambiance down pat. BabyCakes has the added bonus of providing many options for ""gentle tummies"" so all of y'all with wheat, egg, and dairy allergies can join the rest of us in pigging out. Er, I mean, cultivating your summer bodies. Admittedly, I haven't tried most of the BabyCakes menu, but I'm not sure if I would ever turn down a regular cupcake in favor of a gluten-free one, especially when I'm not averse to gluten and I've noticed that gluten-free pastries just taste a little ... different. Not bad, per se, just not the same in terms of texture. Also, I do very much appreciate that they post their nutritional and allergen info on their website. It's very cool that there are so many bean flours out there - like garbanzo and fav bean flour! I did notice that almost all of their products contain xanthan gum, which, while used in almost everything as a stabilizing agent to keep oils and whatnot from separating, may come into contact with allergens like wheat and soy during its production process. - Lemon cupcake: Not as tender as a regular cupcake but still very good. Lemon-based desserts tend to swing to either too sweet or too tart but this one managed to retain both a strong lemon flavor without any overwhelming sweetness.  - Chocolate dipped donut. I bit into this expecting the flaky, chewy layers of a regular Dunkin Donut or a Krispy Kreme but this is actually much denser. I foolishly forgot to order a drink while eating my sweets and so this sat like a brick in my stomach but almond milk would have paired great. - Double chocolate crumb. Definitely get this one. Even compared to regular cakes made with white flour and white sugar, this ranked as one of the top cakes. Chocolate in every crevice. Very similar to a brownie in terms of how dense it is (sorry for the repeated use of ""dense"" - I've just run out of adjectives to describe how solid the goods are). The cupcakes and cookies are a little pricey relative to their size but the cake is certainly worth your money. I'll be back if I'm ever in the LES and a craving hits for the dark chocolate crumb! Location: right at Broome street, Erion McKenna is tiny and nothing special. I mean, if you pass by, you probably gonna miss it. Place is tiny and I am surprised if you want to sit-in. Place is dark as well, but the surprising thing is that you can watch chef making bakeries.Food: it's probably the first vegan, gluten-free store in NYC. I have been longing to be here but never got a chance or passion to be here. Why, cuz I am not either vegan or gluten-free. Why, I am lactose free...JKSo They have cupcakes, bread, and donuts. Of course, I chose only one maple donut ... It was not what I want. First of all, the donut is cake donut. Maple syrup is okay tho. Overall, it is just less compatible with other donut places.Service: efficientPrice: average price is 3.5 or more.Be awared.But to be honest, I love their vegan donut better than By Chloe's bakeries...overall: 3.5 stars. This place is so cute! I really wished there baked goods was something special so I can go back but unfortunately it wasn't. I walked in to a friendly and helpful staff that helped me pick out the mocha carrot cupcake which was good and the cinnamon sugar donut which was okay I also ordered the chocolate chip banana bread which wasn't anything special. I hope the recipes improve between the location, decor and staff they can go places!! I was looking for vegan cupcakes and found the most delish ones here! Had a carrot cupcake with cinnamon frosting. Cake was moist with just the right amount of carrot and spices. Frosting was absolute vegan heaven--creamy, just the right texture and perfectly sweet. Two vegan thumbs up! Forgetting I was in a vegan bakery in Soho, I ordered a dozen doughnuts. When they guy behind the counter said ""that will be $47,"" I had a mini heart attack, but said ""okay,"" and handed the man my credit card, because he had already packed them up, and I don't like inconveniencing people. When I took one (then two, then three...) out at home, HOLY FUCK. SO GOOD. WORTH EVERY DOLLAR. I'm not a vegan, and I don't even really like cake doughnuts (I prefer yeast doughnuts), but these were some of the best I've ever had. I've eaten them for dinner every night this week (and not just because I basically blew my grocery budget on doughnuts). Go here. Get a doughnut. Get more doughnuts. Do it. (And don't JUST go for the pretty toppings; even the doughnuts that look boring don't taste boring.) I've been here twice and I want to love it because vegan, gluten free and sweetened with something other than refined white sugar is right up my alley but it's just ok, in my opinion. I tried the agave brownie - it was cakey and just lacked any oomph of chocolate flavor. I also tried the pumpkin bread - again, ok. I could taste the underlying (garbanzo?) flour and it wasn't really that full of pumpkin flavor. It was a little dry but not too bad. I also tried a carrot cake cupcake with vanilla frosting. The moisture level was good but again, lacked much flavor. I think they could add just a bit more spices and carrot and really bring it to the next level. The win for me is the thin mint cookie and the coconut mounds - those were the only 2 items that really stood out last time I came here too. I should have learned from my first experience and just bought those and saved some money. The selection is limited and is previously noted by others, it is small. One other thing that I would like to add is that both visits, the staff leave much to be desired. They are unfriendly and it seems like a burden to have to answer questions you may have or assist you. If I""m in the area, I would stop for a thin mint and mounds. Otherwise, not worth going out of my way to stop in. This will serve as a reminder to me next time I go to NYC and try to determine which places are worth returning to! Not a big sweets guy but it was my dads bday and I was instructed to pick up dessert. What a score to find this spot in the LES. Totally vegan and gluten free! Score!! Not sure what the negative reviews are about, this place is a winner. it can be tough to find such good vegan baked goods and felt lucky to find them. Got the donuts because they are BAKED and not FRIED like what you get at any other vegan donut places. They are not oily, so maybe that's why some people don't like here. Anyways, very delicious and come in the afternoon for full menu. Samona and mocha are so good (not overly sweet/moist like a cake)I absolutely love those bakeries even though I never like donuts or cupcakes. For me, these are usual sugar overdose and ehh. But Erin changed me. The donuts are for sample, which is light and fluffy. The cupcake I got is coconut chai- which seem to be less sweet! But it's really good! The cashier said the death by chocolate is probably the sweetest. Also got veggie biscuit - not that good. More chewy type. Cupcakes are around $5 and donuts are $4. I went there pretty late on weekend nights, not so many choices left. I love Erin McKenna's bakery.  I remember checking it out when the bakery first opened, as Babycakes.  And am happy to report that the variety of choices, the quality of each item and overall deliciousness is top notch.I have a huge sweet tooth and checked out mostly all of the bakeries in New York.  While I'm not a vegan or gluten intolerant, I am mindful of what I put into my body, and Erin McKenna's bakery always feels like a sweet indulgence that I can feel good about.  I know there are no processed ingredients, artificial colors, or weird stuff that I can't pronounce in anything they create.The texture of the products and flavor cannot be beat!  You're definitely not compromising on taste or soulful sweet goodness in coming here.I recently ordered a couple of doughnuts and chocolate chip cookie sandwich through Postmates.  All were delicious - highly recommend! Thank you Erin McKenna for having some great allergy options! :) I can't eat eggs or wheat and you guys saved my birthday. I'm really glad places like theirs exists. The shop is teeny tiny, but they have so many good options. Their donuts are soft and tasty and sweet, the scones/cream buns crumble nicely, and their cupcakes have fun icing. They had the best vegan cinnamon rolls I've every had (which were also gluten free!) - flaky and buttery with lots of cinnamon. The only thing that was off was with their chocolate cake and cupcakes - they were pretty burnt, and I think it must have been hard for them to tell because of the color. 3.5The bakery is extremely tiny and they have a very cute interior. It's quaint. You definitely feel like you're in some tiny small-town shop instead of a famous bakery in New York. There's almost no seating inside, which I think would be nice to have! I used to live nearby here, and since my boyfriend is vegan, we've been here a lot.Most of the time, the people who work there aren't too friendly/warm. It's also extremely overpriced ($4 for a tiny donut?!). However, if you're looking for vegan/gluten-free baked goods, this is a great option. They have yummy cinnamon rolls, donuts, clairs, and cupcakes. I will say it's awesome that everything is vegan - it's not easy to find many places like this! Give it a try, I would recommend going at least once to see if you like it. I've always been meaning to try this spot out. I am not a fan of dairy so the fact that this place offers vegan baked goods is a huge plus in my book. Unfortunately I have not found much luck in finding moist delicious treats that are dairy free, but I think I've hit the jackpot. I bought quite a few things just to try and found every single one of them to be soft and delicious. Especially loved the chocolate chip cookie. I tried four of their cupcakes, a donut, a scone, a brownie, a cookie, and a madeleine PUMPKIN PIE CUPCAKEBROWNIE MOCHA CUPCAKECINNAMON CARROT CUPCAKERED VELVET CUPCAKECINNAMON SUGAR DONUTBLUEBERRY LEMON SCONE BROWNIECHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE MADELEINE (which I ate on my way home- couldn't wait lol)Side note: the employees here have serious RBF, but they were generally nice. It's really hard to find a vegan bakery when you're not in NYC. Since I was in NYC I decided to try one I found on trip advisor which lead me to Erin McKennas. My expectations were neutral and I decided to order a blueberry scone and a mint brownie. I wasn't thrilled with either. The scone was meh and the mint brownie although the icing was awesome the brownie itself was like a dry chocolate cupcake there was nothing ""brownie"" about it. The prices were a little high but I expect that in NYC . The display was dark and you really couldn't see what was in the case and there weren't prices on anything. It was so hot inside and i was expecting a little more from a well known NYC bakery.",https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/31OPPJ-LTZHBMBzT8oMPQQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JufqjYCTGQmRJmJZNsvWuA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZMhbjEWQF4y5ZlCIjuKARw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TwFA0NDKQUzJpgkAjxc5Pw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/t1gXz8zxxO9X_rMr9nq-Pg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rFNlFy8eXtYORJhyBJ-1Hg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0F_adZcK1J-wwHWiBBu7SA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fOzNHziWI54qxaE5jMwnZQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dReJnKgginI9oIaUp-S80g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1shboATVpdgWznSJlU12iA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Lvt3vQNUBXySX45vL_QEdA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mZCcrof9CC5pLRMptV7sZQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/r0-Hv5-zRZ4KvGEbWCDx9A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tLPFBevKcpNoK13EWkLujA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ylA5ibFYURRJ5f49mEcl2Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mR3KaQPbSDMe3CPRcxj9zg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lYxLUY-ORIffJ7QJMiBp0w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bhEdvvfO3rBG--RUkWlfxA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6BVJBr8eE-qVv1Ct8_tSCA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/K0G2VEZqUdGrYAmXMpLJ1A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LTCJYzTmjBvu6C43o-B3GQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Zc7aH55-PFp5AG2UfJOmGg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/iE426sd0-3lRA-Z9jjfg_Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8Skbltw4fTTEc0JIT4bz5A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SZC0nx0rrlIVtrZL7A0bWg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NMSPt049olpIA2CffQ7tAQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lFV-PhJwGpob6HcUU5M9WA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NE71aDMHPmRnoj_4SALZ1Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_chUEhuDIfpR0EGNQtV29g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/a1YW0nGalZOPJNccPm6wKw/258s.jpg
https://www.yelp.com//biz/essex-new-york,essex-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Bars,American (New),NA,"Let's face it, the main reason people make a weekend reservation to this place is for the bottomless brunch. In total with our entree we spent about $50/ person. This was including mimosas, bloodies, and screwdrivers. You can also interchange between these three throughout your meal if you get sick of one. The service is great they are very attentive to your glass. The mimosas are already made and they go around with pitchers and when I say you will not see the bottom of your glass I mean it. So the bottomless is definitely worth it if you are trying to get your day going. The waitress was also nice enough to get a group picture of our table and she was very happy to take it. As far as the food goes there is a good selection. Everyone was satisfied with the portion size of the meal. The food is ok but it is not amazing which is to be expected with a place like this. It gets very very crowded on weekends and the turnover is pretty quick (1.5 hours). Good place to bring a big party in LES! Never ever order the scallops from here. The last few times I came they were amazing and that's why came tonight. They Were undercooked which is extremely hard to do when you're cooking a scallop bc most ppl over cook the crap out of them and they become rubbery. These come with risotto witch was PHENOMENAL. The bartender was a sweetheart about it though. Our group of five enjoyed dinner on Saturday night.  The restaurant has a strange setup with several different dinner zones but I think this adds privacy and uniqueness to your dining experience.  The bar area can get loud so being removed from it allows you to enjoy your dinner conversations.  The dinner lighting areas are dark so you can't really see and appreciate and critique your food because you can't really see it.THe food was excellent and the staff was excellent. We did come early so we had no competition for our attention. I would strongly recommend the sliders with short ribs.  You get three and unfortunately I agreed to share them before I tasted them. The rack of lamb was served lukewarm unfortunately but was incredibly succulent. It was probably a little fatty but I couldn't really tell because of the lighting. Final adviceCome earlyGet sliders and lamb rackReasonably priced I came here for one of my friend's bottomless birthday brunches. (Say that five times fast!) and was underwhelmed. We were a party of nine and dined in the afternoon.Here's what you need to know about Essex:1. Great service. Our mimosas were always topped off (which makes it easy to lose count... so be prepared) and the servers were accommodating to our questions. 2. Vibes are typical LES NYC brunch. This spot is an institution for a reason.3. Relatively extensive menu. There are options for everyone here. Vegetarian, vegan, everyone will be happy here.4. So here is the rub: the food... is bland and overprice. I got the Southern Brunch and ended up smothering it in hot sauce, and it was still plain. AND IT WAS COLD. I didn't have the heart to make a big deal out of it, especially it was my friend's birthday. But paying about $50 for brunch and to have it be that level of quality? Not okay.While the mimosas are delicious and strong, it doesn't overcome the overpriced and less-than-mediocre food. I wouldn't come back on my own, only if someone threw a birthday party here. If you have a choice, I recommend Sons of Essex. The vibes are a little more fun and the food is significantly better. I was walking around headed to another brunch spot when I came across this place. What caught my attention was the music it was awesome it seemed like a party was going and I didn't want to be left out. We had a less than 10 min wait time which was awesome. I loved the atmosphere  and music.  It was a young vibrant hip place. I had eggs Benedict with lobster.My food was so friggin good!!  Everything was awesome only thing I wished that music wasnt so loud. Went here for a bottomless brunch with some friends for their birthday. Won't return because the food was not that good at all I guess because people mainly go for the bottomless drinks. I believe the brunch was around 35$ a head. I ordered egg-whites with fruit and potatoes. Seriously how do you mess up eggs? I guess they were just sitting all morning. Also the fruit was sour and wilted over a bed of lettuce. I sent this back and got the banana and chocolate pancakes which were actually really good and filling. The waitress was really nice and accommodated all of our requests.  The place itself is very nice inside with two levels. The decor on the wall however was very dusty lol. They also brought out a nice slice of cake for my friends birthday. I just think that there are so many nicer brunch places in the city than this one. Caveat: my only time here so far as been for a private catered event.  However, multiple people from our company who have dined at Essex on various occasions said that they bring the same level of excellence to their main dining.Decent space.  Really like how the upstairs space over looks Essex Market.  And the general location is prime!The staff were lovely.  Most of them were working our party and the entire evening shift.  But they kept it professional, personable, and even went above and beyond what was included in our package.  Excellent bartenders with some heavy hands, and really great wait staff, who truly seemed invested in the cuisine they were serving, and our enjoyment of it.  I either liked or loved the majority of the items served.  A few things were ""okay..."", but nothing was bad.  Highlights were the delicious crab cakes, the attention to aesthetics for the crudites, the amazing cured salmon on their lovely potato pancakes and beautiful crema, amazing fillet mignon, and the single best lobster ravioli I have ever eaten anywhere in the world (how the chef jam-packs every ravioli with that much well-seasoned, flaky lobster without the gorgeously thin pasta popping?  I do NOT know!).Already plan to return on my own dime, and would gladly pop in to chill at the bar if passing by.  Big new fan! Came here for a corporate event. We got a spacious room with food serving stations placed around. The food was always full and attentive and clean overall. Great experience. Saturday- brunch review:$17 a la carte (just entree) or $32 bottomless mimosa/ screwdriver/ Bloody Mary + entree. Refills were on point. Entree: grilled shrimp avocado salad - 5/10. Nothing special - cucumbers spinach red peppers grilled shrimp and mashed avocados. WORST PLACE EVER!!!! DO NOT GO!!!! I am at the emergency room right now and called 30 hours in advance to cancel a reservation, and the MANAGER told me he's charging me $60 for this. I asked nicely if he could wave it since I'm currently in the emergency room and he said ""you bet your ass we're going to charge you"". What kind of soulless person does this? I've never witnessed such bad customer service. I will make sure I spread the word to never go here. Loved  Essex. I traveled to Essex from 42nd and 9th because nothing relevant is in midtown and my tastebuds are worth the $2.95.I ordered the Aristocrat and there were no disappointments. Only qualm was that I could have had 3 eggs instead of two to even out the flavors of Nova salmon, eggs and latkes.My friend got the spinach version of eggs Benedict. We sat upstairs, Mo was our waiter and he hooked it up. I will most likely return again. I love this place. The service here is spectacular! Right when we got through the door my girlfriend and I was greeted by one of the most personable security guards I have ever encountered. He made great conversation and embraced everyone with open arms. Then after 5 mins or so we were seated. The waitress always kept our glass full, and brought the food out promptly. I recommend the chocolate banana pancakes, mmmmm delicious. You have to be seated by 4:30 if you want to participate in the brunchly activities. I recommend also making a reservation, place gets packed quickly Went for brunch, the unlimited Mamosa's was great. My tofo scramble was good. Space was limited but nice overall experience. Will attend again. Brought in the new year here at Essex; with a prefix food menu and a top shelf open bar for 3 hours it was well worth it. NYE 2018 the place was a mad house. The entire place was packed and the hostess was no where to be found at first. After finding her she pulled up my 10:30pm reservation and whisked us up to our table. The open bar package was well worth it and the waitress made sure we always had one more on the way. The champagne flowed all night, probably too much by the time it was all said and done. The food came out in a timely fashion. The oysters were fresh, the scallops were plump and the sea bass was cooked perfectly. At $135pp it seemed overpriced at first however the tasty food accompanied with strong and constant drinks coupled with great service made it well worth it. This place is just okay. It's a place to go brunch, nothing special about it. They will make sure that your glass is never empty. The food is just okay- came out 7 minutes after ordering and was barely warm. Can't say enough good things about Essex! We were very late for our resi due to insane NYC traffic, and they found a way to accommodate our party of 5! My whole table ordered something different and were all pleased! Highly recommend the Avacado toast and the Mac n Cheese! Service I as great, our drinks were always filled! Lastly the music was the ultimate playlist. I'll be back! I've been here multiple times for happy hour and it's a decent venue. The bartenders are OK, when they want to be. I think the crowd annoys them and they don't have patience.This time I was here for brunch. We had a 3:15 reservation and didn't sit down until after 4. They gave us ONE free drink ticket for the brunch drink (basically a mimosa while we waited). Once seated, or servers were great! I think they knew they'd messed up and we weren't happy. I was even able to get the yelp specialty drink. Honoring your ads are a plus! The food was very good. I needed a little more steak for an additional $4. That extra charge is unnecessary for that amount of meat. I got to taste the breakfast nachos and they were amazing. I may come back for that, unless they make me wait another 3732887401 minutes for a table. We came to have brunch for my cousin's birthday and we were a party of eight. Some were running late and they were very flexible with us while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. Once we sat down, Lola came over immediately got us started on our drinks. Lola helped make this whole experience an enjoyable and unforgettable one! She constantly refilled our drinks, ensured we were ok, and offered to provide anything that was needed. Thanks to Lola for her efforts and efficiency; she is a gem! TL;DR: the $31 bottomless brunch undoubtedly draws people here.Like many other LES brunch spots, Essex is unabashedly trendy and survives on it. The promise of inexpensive bottomless mimosas/screwdrivers/Bloody Marys is what likely draws in crowds of yuppies (though more racially heterogeneous than other LES spots) which is how I found myself here on a Sunday morning. After waiting 2 million years in Brunch Time, a floating host led us to our seat by the kitchen, where we got a front row seat in seeing else's food come out except for ours. Onto the food and drinks. I did not get a bottomless deal bc I was not trying to ~turn up~ but I tried some of my friends'. Mimosa was really watered down, Bloody Mary was just way too strong and I don't think any of us wanted to know what their screwdriver was like. Food-wise, I had the eggs Benedict with kale which was ok. They had the smallest poached eggs known to man which were not runny in any way, on English muffins that seemed rather stale. My friend's cheesy grits looked amazing, though, as did the potato pancakes, but I'm vegetarian so neither of those were available to me bc they come with salmon or shrimp. So all in all, I don't think it'd be back unless i were trying to day drink and I suddenly started eating meat, though maybe the food is better when turnt. The service overall was amazing, the second your drink went empty they were there to refill it instantly.  The food however was a completely different story.  I got the short rib hash, this sounded like a good choice but I was rather disappointed by what it actually was.  I ordered my eggs over easy and they came out over hard and the short rib in the hash was about 30% meat and 70% gristle.  For around 50$ the service was exemplary but the food fell very short of what was expected.",https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TX4d3GvycGbPk1Kq080BGw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/k4V-PxhHIBuT_EdXMO8QMA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2LkSmeIv_Qpi8vSPyb6BNQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/H1ygKinDg3-y8DPMGdlMJw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wjOj-UpB_DQCnRGWkD9NnA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SsRwfhYuZgT1HAlWVTbiOQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-etzCSA9NY-x0_8gRyTAJQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vLV_2HkWTLCv1cRL9Jycpw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yIVx0DgSn_o0_IxbyRefXQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/coZZ2fdGiuacj4YK_xNEhw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WbXDV11qPVHUfGaq4ruVFg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kPmfLwDijZPl02iedev91g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_0c2ulGV4VvIikdoVB81og/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/aJf05Jkst56gM-2WNZJsGA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-Eit-7RKZikh3h35qInMNQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wPsVS-au7cToAyZdrrAwbA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_0cyrorsqZcq6VcUpQcsuQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pydBZ8FQSj6dbdREVYHcbg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nYi2UZ8gmou2328zotAapw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/V-K2-13Dp1WEWM0wwHYWUQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jQJcbaGbhPeLH8GnnrkZNA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dDb_e3nIG0MMA7Ly2BO59g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1v0dWBO7blai6dcHNPD6ag/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8QLfOOpGZ3gBdThl5bFA-Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Sucxqo3h4GKe7sSeIFNLMg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KTzKKXmg8emjDAEuEW_87A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rsLVs9xHokvWMSvP2MRgJA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xQrdKletldck-42FWnfajw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HPp7dISf5Wp5p0TIrka8mQ/258s.jpg,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/excuse-my-french-new-york,excuse-my-french-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Bars,Tapas Bars,French,"It's rare when an establishment puts equal detail and attention into service, decor, atmosphere and food. Excuse My French does just that. Upon entering, I was taken by the warm atmosphere, colorful wall paper and beautiful paintings hanging throughout. We ended up choosing seats at the chefs table/bar where you can see things being cooked. This area actually had built in outlets which were great for iPhone charging during dinner. We started with cocktails-The French 75 (gin simple syrup, champagne and lemon) and The Sidecar- (Armagnac, Countreau, Lemon, Sugar rum). Both drinks were sizable and very well made. The food here is tapas style and the waiter recommended 5-6 shared plates for two. We ended up ordering The Burrata salad, soft shell crab, foie gras lollipops, escargot and duck confit. Pretty quickly after ordering our settings were placed with the the prettiest blue and white napkins i've ever seen at a restaurant. Our dishes came our nearly all at once which made it a little crowded, but it was also nice to be able to go back and forth between dishes. Nothing here was less than delicious, but the highlights of the meal for me were the burrata salad and foie gras. These dishes all came out so pretty &amp; beautifully presented that you almost feel bad devouring them. The amazing decor and detail in here continues all the way to the bathroom area in the back, which is covered in bookshelf wallpaper to give a hidden door feel. Overall we had a very memorable lovely time here and will absolutely be back. The kind of bar you want in your neighborhood.All sorts of tasty French dishes. Loved the bone marrow.Wine by the glass and cocktails for a low key evening.Foie gras Lollipops to splurge.Roasted cauliflower for the veggies.Small place, no reservation. Very fond of this place. Came here for happy hour and ordered the sparkling wine. For some sides we ordered the Foie Gras Lollipops and the Escargot. If I could eat the Foie Gras lollipop for the rest of my life I would. It was simply amazing and hit all of the spots.Excuse My French is a bit on the smaller side so good for small groups. The decor is very pleasant and the space has nice ambiance. The staff also made you feel very welcome. Also they are festively decorated for the holidays. Can't wait to go back again ! Cute little spot. Not much seating space but not bad seating at the bar. Nice decor. Food:Cheese plate; always a great choice at a French restaurant. Hard to go wrong with this choice, and this restaurant did not disappoint with their cheese plate. Pan seared yellow fin tuna with espellete; pretty good. The pepper on the periphery added a good flavor to the tuna. The couscous did not add much to the dish. Duck Confit Parmentier; duck Confit with truffle puree, crushed potatoes and olive oil. A bit disappointing. I usually expect the duck confit to be very soft, with the duck meat falling off the bone. Having eaten duck confit in France may have spoiled me. Unfortunately this duck confit was quite dry and the potato was overpowering. I felt like I was eating a potato dish with maybe some meat mixed in, which is not what I wanted from this dish.If I come back I want to try their crepes. I've been here twice now and I must say--the cocktails are my favorite. The royle--lavender and rose ones are so good. I wanted to try the orange blossom last time but unfortunately, they were sold out of it! (Can't wait until I come back for it).I think the tapas are pretty darn good. My favorite is the Steak Tartrate with quail eggs--mmmm. I loved the idea of it, quail eggs--it's hard to find a place that serves it, at least for me anyways. I would say that's my favorite tapa from them thus far. I also had the salmon and scallops, which I thought the salmon wasn't bad but the scallops were pretty amazing as well. I can taste the garlic sauce and it doesn't take away the fresh taste that scallop brings out. It was pretty amazing.I would also comment that it's a pretty romantic spot for couples who just want to sit and chat. They have flowers everywhere and it goes well with the dcor and their setup. Honestly, I would love to bring my friends here just for the cocktails to sit at the bar and drink.. because why not? Nice atmosphere, not too loud, cute set up, long bar table (my fav) and wonderful staffs? So why not?Highly recommend it if you're trying to find a date spot or bringing a friend or two to chat with. It's a nice place *wink*. Really cozy and great interior. Had the 2 for 1 deal and had 4 cocktail for 4. This happens before 7pm when we went on Friday. This place is a little gem, great food, great cocktails and lovely staff. They always play good music but at a level where can you can still hear your companions. I came here with a girlfriend of mine on a Tuesday night. We ate before we came so we only ordered drinks. They have a great selection of cocktail. I ordered the rose syrup Prosecco and my friend ordered the cherry blossom cocktail. Rose syrup Prosecco: they make the rose syrup in house, from real roses! The drink is not too sweet, it was perfect. They also put real fried roses in the drinks, super girly and pretty! Cherry blossom cocktail: very strong. It has vodka and other cherry liquor. They also put edible flowers in the drink, very pretty. They have happy hour from Sunday - Wednesday from 5-7, so I will definitely be back! Oh! The owner and bartenders are super friendly. I'm a sucker for cozy, cute cocktail/wine spots, and EMF got me hooked! It's a little tapas joint that oozes a profoundly quaint, unpretentious, and charming vibe. It was only 5pm on a Friday, so we made it in for HH and ordered several cocktails and glasses of wine before heading for dinner. The bartender was pretty awesome - good humor, great attitude, and attentive to details and requests for suggestions/recommendations. Wish I caught his name. I'll make sure to ask next time.  The food looked great but we already had dinner plans (and had eaten only just hours before getting there). It's a hidden gem in the midst of all the chaos in Chinatown. Sit down for a quick drink or a romantic date night - you won't have to excuse your French ;) Cute little tapas spot, we nearly tried everything on the menu, the escargots, the desserts, the duck confit, the pate, scallops, seared tuna, brusselsprouts, foie Gras lollipops melted in your mouth. The chicken breast in the quinoa dish was not that well cooked, must've been an off night though. Service was only ok but we had a new server who only started his second day. The French pressed coffee was really good and after a long day at work, I definitely needed it for a long night after to celebrate a co birthday. All in all it was a good place for some food, will be back to try all other dishes. This was a huge disappointment. A group of five of us came here from a day of rooftop day drinking because we saw it it had high accolades on yelp and was a reasonable walking distance away. The saving graces were our server Perry, the Bordeaux, and baked Camembert with fig jam. However, the negatives are unfortunately glaring. I am normally very positive but this one was such a let down. The scallop carpaccio was very bitter, the foie gras lollipops cold, and worst of all the duck confit was bland and tasteless. My friend described the duck the best - cheaply blended and molded. We expressed our dissatisfaction with the duck confit to our waiter and urged him to try what we were tasting. He took the dish, presumably tried it, and came back saying it was prepared the way it was supposed to taste. Then, proceeded to return our half eaten dish to the table, which we left untouched. We found that extremely odd and unprofessional especially if he had tried it like he said. When the check arrived, that duck confit was still on it! We paid graciously and obliged to the automatic gratuity for parties of 5+ but left extremely disappointed. Our friends from the NYT will be writing our experience as well. With all the other wine bar options in the area, won't be back. Came here yesterday with some friends to enjoy some tapas and some cocktails. One of my friends confused this place with ""Pardon my French"" which is totally understandable, I asked their owner about it and there is some friendly relation between the two chefs.Excuse my French is one of the most beautiful cocktail spots I've been to recently. The walls, the ceilings, the paintings, the lighting - everything screams romantic, vintage, artsy...it's a gorgeous place for a date. I had 2 cocktails here - champagne with rose reduction with an edible hibiscus flower (I felt like a princess) and an Ocean Mist because I'm obsessed with all things ocean-related and it's blue. Both were delicious. I also got to try a cocktail that was dedicated to a French woman who died in an elevator...fascinatingly sad story, beautiful cocktail. They also brought out a special layered cocktail made for Bastille Day, it was made to look like the French flag and served with a pop rock rim and a rock candy skewer to to stir with. Cocktails and candy? I'm sold. Sign me up!We pretty much tried all the tapas and the ones that stood out to me the most were their own-seated tuna and their grilled salmon gravlax with dill citrus marinade on toast. For dessert they brought out a sugary crepe with light orange flavor that had been drizzled with grand mariner and they lit it on fire. Dessert set on fire and drizzled with alcohol? SIGN ME UP AGAIN!! The crepe was pretty good. I liked the texture but it was sugarier than I prefer.Overall my friends and I had a really great time here and I would definitely return for some more awesome cocktails! When we first walked in, it felt like a speakeasy bar but of course it's so much more!  The place is small, inviting and there are lots of attention to details from the pattern on the napkins to the etched cocktail glasses.  Food was good but not the most amazing French food we've had.  There were some misses.  The Country Pate didn't have the savory flavor and I'm not sure it's made of liver?  The other miss was the duck confit served with potatoes.  The presentation looked nice but the duck and potato were dry and we did not taste any truffle at all.  The cocktail menu had a good selection of spirits.  I think this place is great for drinks and light dinner or snacks but we came for full on dinner which it was good overall but we might have ordered too much where we experienced some of the not so good dishes. Okay, so maybe I'm just not a Francophile.  But I really wanted to like this place.I had high hopes coming here, but in the end, I just can't muster up the energy nor the enthusiasm to look on the bright side.  Almost all of the foods we had were mediocre and overpriced and WAY TOO SALTY.The sea scallop carpaccio?  It had an awful fishy smell and way too salty.  The baked portobello?  It was hard as a rock as well as a very potent salt bomb.  The croque monsieur was way too salty too.  The only thing that I could say was decent was the cajun chicken with the side of quinoa and ratatouille.Even the drinks weren't that good either.  Service was good though.I just can't. Small but very cute tapas bar. The service was good and they had great decor. For drinks we got the Moulin Rouge and Bastille Day, and for food we got scallops and Brussels sprouts. I highly recommend the Brussels sprouts and I heard the salad with burrata is good. I've been in this area for years and on this same exact block and had no idea that Excuse my French was located in a little cozy basement. I had dinner here on a Thursday and it was very packed. Don't worry, grab a beer next door at Top Hops while you wait. The only thing that I didn't like at Excuse my French was the seating. It's basically a long bar all the way down except for a couple small tables in the front. As we seated at the bar, the waitress recommended a nice French red that was very good. We ordered a bunch of tapas for the table. We started with a bunch of cheeses and charcuterie. They paired nicely together especially with a little wine sip. We also ordered the duck rillettes which was probably my favorite thing the whole night. We shared a steamed artichoke for the table. Cooked nicely and brought back childhood memories which can sound weird. My other favorite dish was the sea scallop carpaccio. Cut very thin with a lot of flavor. It's topped with salmon caviar and yuzu. For my entree, I ordered the duck confit parmentier which is a gorgeous presentation. It's paired with crushed potatoes, olive oil and truffle pure. This dish was pretty good but I thought it would be better. Next time, I'll listen to reviews and order the foie gras lollipops. Heard they are amazing.For dessert, they gave the table a free crepe. I kid you not, it's because they liked my cousin. It worked out well for me because it was delicious and a great way to finish a meal. I ordered the cheese camembert plate and some type of tartare dish along with a royal lavender drink. All I can say is - simply DIVINE. I keep raving about the herb infused drink and I desperately want to go back to grab another drink and scoop up another tartare dish. The cheese plate was a nice touch too, but I was tired of it after several scoops (split between two people). This restaurant introduced me to what french cuisine consists of. Other french places I've been to typically include sandwiches and salads, and I was always somewhat disappointed in the complexity of the meals offered. Overall, TRY excuse my french. You will not be disappointed. A tiny and utterly charming place that I would have walked by completely if not for my friends who live in the neighborhood and are regulars there. We stopped by on a cold night after dinner, so we indulged only in drinks and desserts, but that was enough to show me the quality of this spot. As for drinks: whether you're into the straightforward stuff or something a little fancier, you'll find something to your liking here for sure. They have a whole menu of just royale drinks with housemade syrup, and as I can never pass up anything rose flavored, I went with that. It wasn't too sweet, perfectly bubbly, and just lovely. The drinks range around $12-13, which in NYC terms isn't bad at all for an upscale bevvy. For bites, my group shared a few crepes including the strawberry chantilly, which was my personal favorite. They also had something called the 'imperial mandarin souffle,' which looks and tastes and extravagant as the name suggests! Again, it's cozy, warm, frilly, and a lot of fun. A perfect spot for a date night or a girls' get-together. I'm a big fan and I think you will be too! Excuse My French is a charming (and narrow) restaurant that serves French tapas.  For dinner, we decided on four dishes to share.  Three of the four were delicious - brussel sprouts with lamb merguez, organic chicken with ratatouille, and the croque monsieur.  The tuna with Israeli couscous was meh.  Appreciated the authenticity and home cooked style.  In no rush to come back but definitely glad we tried it! It becomes my favorite spot in LES!!!  I have been this place few times already and never got disappointed!!! I love all dishes on the menu!  I went there tonight again with my friend, my friend loves the place too. The service is very friendly especially the manager is attentive to ensure we were good.  I definitely go back again and bring different friends to be there!  Excuse My French, please keep it up!  Will visit you soon again!",https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wmaT0GMRL04lzzrgP1ALcw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8IBAJOs9Ts7mEnk6V_bzww/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0scg-NtuVV4EIW1UgqG58Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BlLdt6fuAf17A6XFvUaqYg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3Klgad1UnfPkJOwrT8xvtw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Eb_VGO-cdn36I0x9hk67UQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-naP-dz-NnlDL4lwfk8i4w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/W3EReAWHz5lx2VwES9gS9Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IprQLX4hh_W9KBhBALe2lw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jPw87lXUkdqID_qkdTZTyQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DpBy1mvx_zpKW6Gh9VJ9-Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Yf9SM0uV_dqLzclnYIbLEg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/USq2dzsNDrCqUhSWuAW_Wg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZUzMYwfzr7_CAc5dznYAtw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hfHXzxnOTisPgPRoloE4ew/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/g_kyxFL-jGnO0I-bMCDXRw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fINcusnC0MPZsWWFD_ZlXw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wP3ccJGZ6Ft4NSA682btrQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nuwqj_B7DlVZ6zp_MrXteg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KavWd47rtSF1Yf0x1Rnhtw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jzyVR2XwN2Ue5rBdVWlq0w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TTUF5Mgf0KCjERMXT2ReOQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fJ1TSzhWY6T0jsStEFfKkQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9BzL8ubQcdn85zl-g9cUYw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jlhxFKsLPmVNnWaTWs2TGg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XyndtUn3NdLcsJtXXdZqJg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/M5ax70Cm4o3o-9XwOoYrOQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WkeNvn_I6iCYBncblp1gUw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kQ9zRNieMYxMDWvRf-5XRA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hw9ulJLObBAdOQCydZJAmw/258s.jpg
https://www.yelp.com//biz/factory-tamal-new-york,factory-tamal-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Mexican,NA,NA,"TL;DR Latino approved. This place is legit.--I was craving Tamales for quite some time and I was happy to find this place. I walked from Wall St to this location.The mole and rajas are so good. The tamales are very authentic and priced well. I got 2 tamales an an horchata for less than $9.00.I spoke with one of the workers and he said that this location was opened up so their family had a place to eat together. Their previous space wasn't big enough for everyone. The tamales are not made with masa.I can literally go on and on about the history of this place but you have to give it a try for yourself. Came here on a lazy weekend for a pre-dinner snack. The restaurant is a small space, but cozy. I ordered a few things on the menu to get a sampler: rajas con queso tamales, chipotle with chicken tamales, and an egg sandwich with bacon. I really wanted to try to mole pablano with chicken tamale but they didn't have any, which was unfortunate. Hopefully this was a one off thing. The tamales were pretty decent. Chicken tamale was a little dry and the rajas tamale didn't have much filling. Egg sandwich was well executed with a perfectly runny fried egg with crisp bacon on a nice brioche bun. Would definitely try again just for the mole pablano chicken tamale. Fingers crossed. They're well known for their tamales, but hot damn if they don't have one of the best breakfast sandwiches in NY as well.Because so much has been said of their tamales, I'll talk about the BEC. The king of breakfast sandwiches in this city, this bacon, egg, and cheese rests between a soft Balthazar brioche bun that makes it just a bit magical. A bit more pricey than your bodega's, but well worth it. Great price for a delicious tamal. Filled generously and there is a varied selection. The space is small and there is sparse seating so not suited for a large group. Great lunch spot for a tight budget! Just happened to walk by and tried a Tamal de Rajas con Queso. It was as good as the ones my mom makes in MX D.F. Eh, underwhelming.  If you want good legit tamales go walk along Roosevelt ave or Spanish Harlem and hit up the street vendors.  You'll see ladies pushing shopping carts with large pots or coolers. Delicious $3 egg sandwich on a brioche bun as well as very friendly service.  The $2.50 tamales are also very delish. It is a very comfortable and warm atmosphere that feels inviting when you sit down. Stopped by since I was in the neighborhood and had heard great things! It was before lunch, so unfortunately I only allowed myself one tamale and that was the chipotle chicken tamale -- piping hot and steamy. I devoured it! Definitely will be back to try all the other tamales, along with the avocado salad (which looked amazing)! Very good prices and friendly staff too Factory Tamal is a cozy Mexican cafe serving sandwiches and tamales. No burritos or tacos here! Its great to see a place giving love to the other great Mexican dishes.  The space has one standard table, one couch with a coffee table, and a counter for two by the window. We came in during breakfast hours but the full menu was available which was nice. My wife ordered a vegetarian torta, which she enjoyed. I had tamales. I tried a chicken and green salsa, a chipotle chicken, a cheese and pepper,  and a bacon and mozzarella. I was slightly skeptical of a bacon tamale, however it was excellent and my favorite item from the meal. The tamales we're decent sized, moist and flavorful. I also tried the the house made horchata which provided a nice compliment to the tamales. Overall decent place if you are looking for tamales or Mexican sandwiches. Neat Mexican cafe that sells tamales in the Lower Eastside. However the name is rather a misnomer. It is neither a factory (for tamales) nor is it solely a tamal purveyor. In fact, there are only three to four tamales options: Mole poblano, rajas con queso, salsa verdes and chicken, and bacon and cheese. When I was just there, they did not have the fourth option. The rest of the menu is filled with sandwiches and salads, making this more of a cafe.Prices are genuinely cheap. Each tamal ran for $2 apiece including tax. I ordered all three of them to try. The tamales were smaller in size compared to Aguila uptown or the Mexican place inside Essex Street Market, but they are rather filling and delicious. The rajas con queso tamal was packed with the peppers and cheese. Decor is really nice, and gives it a feeling of someone's house. There are portraits around the walls that contain tamal leaves and corn kernels, appropriate for an establishment that founds its name in kernels. Welcoming, authentic, unpretentious heaven.Making things from scratch...quite rare these days!I ordered three different kinds of tamales and I'm planning to go back soon for more! All good and flavorful! This place is legit. Best tamales I've ever had. We really appreciated that their menu had a lot of chicken items (as opposed to mostly pork) and they were all delicious. We started by ordering 2 tamales to share for a snack: Chicken Salsa Verde and Chicken Mole. Smackin'! So we ordered 7 more and tried allOf the other flavors ;) Salsa Verde and Rajas were my favorites. Really well balanced and tasted fresh. I washed everything down with an Orchata, that also tasted homemade. The space is cute and cozy. There were about 10 people in there with us. Food is reasonably priced (I wouldn't be mad if they increased their prices a bit). Service is just right. They make everything from scratch including the masa, which was delicious. Super nice owner/chef and would recommend this joint to everybody (New Yorkers, Californians, and everyone else)!Thank you for having us and treating us so well! Very small restaurant but the food is good and the prices are very afforable. I had the avocado salad which was delicious. The mole poblano tamale was pretty good too and it was only $2! The salads are $7 and drinks are mostly $2. They also offer tortas and cold soups. The space is pretty small so groups are not recommended; they have two small tables and some bar seats. Best place for Mexican flavor in lower east side. It's deli style food so you can get sandwiches as well as the tamales that they're famous for. Very good prices for what you get and they even have smaller options like an egg sandwich for $3 which is really tasty. I always get the TortA and just add chicken. Great food, service, value. Tried the three chicken tamales--all delicious. Nice lunch spot in LES where most of the surrounding places seem more focused on the dinner crowd. My mom and I had a GREAT lunch here today. Just 3 blocks from where we live, I couldn't wait to try this spot as I really like tamales. My mom was eager to join me so we took a little stroll in our 'hood to this local eatery. They have tamales mainly from 7am-noon. They have salads and cold and hot sandwiches. They have sodas and hot beverages native to Mexico. We had 2 chipotle chicken, 1 mol poblano, and 1 bacon and cheese tamales. Tasty, tasty, tasty savory treats that donned enough spice and flavor. The masa was great and the fillings were enough to tickle our throats and palettes. The chicken one was our favorite. The mole one had that sorta chocolate note. And the bacon and cheese one was just that. Soft bacon and white gooey cheese. We also partook in the turkey, swiss and pesto sandwich. Pressed and crusty and not overwhelming with meat, cheese or pesto. Just the right size and enough for 2 people who just downed 4 tamales. And what friendly staff members. I engaged with them. My mom spoke a bit with them. We can't wait to visit again and again. I also was really into my 2 fruit punch Jarritos sodas and my mom liked how her strawberry lemonade had bits of strawberry and was not too sweet. We loved it here and can't wait to visit them at this location and at their new location as of 8/15 on 34 Essex Street. Factory Tamal is neither a factory (in style) or a tamale specific restaurant. This small caf is soulful and family owned, serving a variety of lunch plates with an eclectic palate of ingredients ranging from Mexican to Italian. What impresses me most about Tamal is its ability to source incredibly fresh ingredients regardless of its varied offerings. So the avocado and pico de gallo salad has chopped mozzarella...it's bizarre but delicious. The Lower East Side has a lot of trendy places for a salad but none of them plate consistently fresh greens like Tamal does. In addition to the great eats is warm service and reasonable prices. All of my colleagues frequent Factory Tamal and I will recommend them with enthusiasm as they truly deserve the praise. The tamales were awesome. 5 different kinds (we tried all but the bacon one). The mole was so chocolatey. The others were all super fresh tasting. A good variety of spicy and non-spicy ones. Friendly staff. The woman behind the counter helped me under what I was doing wrong with our homemade tamales! Can't wait to try out her suggestions. Tamales are generally pretty tasty but extremely small by tamale standards.  I've tried the rajas, verde, and chipotle.  Mole has unfortunately been available during each of my visits (around 4-5pm on the weekends).  Chiptole is defintely the standout, with verde and rajas being pretty good and on the mild side - unfortunately since tamales are very small you don't get much filling.  However, the corn of the tamale is very distinct and comfy/hearty.  Also had a torta which was tasty, and the horchata was solid.  Customer service is excellent.  That said, I'd probably only go back for the chipotle tamale and the torta. Chicken Salsa Verde Tamale!!!  So yum! Delicate, flavorful, amazing!!! I could eat a dozen. And the guacamole is spot on, just the right amount of spice and cilantro. Delish!",https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VOz41BfHoiOB2y1aTK5vQQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/d5KsXRWcZyhcjd1w12sAYQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/d8r4H73df4n_EQzGsLxGrg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AOYsBf-O4LlbZ4-RvF_zFg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JE09VfGUVGHUoiSNbgxM-g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2TRF9GhvVxhaRb7A3ys9Sw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CrG-IjnlSLhqELmHWr5RIg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mELzCJ4LnUIMRV5eHNHATw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jrdRwydA8zX2M65Kf5YDag/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WBeuxHpTc8ZLHl_Lkn9PkA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EUwg_c6dWpR29RJ6dpHOMw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BHwgUAN585jcA314bW8-VQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rnmXbVZHfrwHmBZCdLMwsQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/aC7V2q2SJ63KRS_wbGUsLg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JsNBKVC_1DdUBY3M4JhZFw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/la18srXu6keRVNmQ_K1TSg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KWNqsvx6n6nJx8pumbrGXw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Z-Z8M5jY3cHY5Gwvc2Sy8g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uuUZTThGPfSbUUOf7u7o4g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zKOX69WXgtUjqEV4tAEu6Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6x7J57NcAv_5Q_MIlw2aTw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lFf1938szz4Y2UpZ0HOjxg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qhWSxkMVOlgLFlxP4vnqbg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/I2njcG7WeTWhutNHFL1hew/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/v9ONaYe1ct9zag5WKXuqEQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/E1AywZxrla83G2ZgmrJOGQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rFfqK06mgEt4J2QarNZ5IQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4hpGGQ5MMfpbFU4I_a7fuQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mDWCU-xjWLJUyt6yFeJ-rA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Ouqyr52Mec2ZciQzMWKSjA/258s.jpg
https://www.yelp.com//biz/freemans-new-york-3,freemans-new-york-3,New York,10002,NY,Breakfast & Brunch,Lounges,Desserts,"loved the ambience here - feels like you're in an English cottage but with more space.The food is mainly your typical English breakfast with American twists - something for everyone. The egg skillet was really good as well as the French toast.The brunch beverages were average, I usually go for a Bloody Mary but was not impressed here so switched to a mimosa.Front staff and waitstaff were both friendly and helpful. This place lies between 3 and 4 stars for me. There isn't anything wrong with the food, but I wasn't impressed enough for 4 stars. This could reflect on my choice of dish rather than the restaurant, as I got the simple English Breakfast. But I did get the chance to also sample my friend's salmon avocado toast, and found the dressing too bitter and the salmon a touch too sweet. The price was typical for NYC brunch, the waiters were attentive, and the decoration was Western unique, but I didn't leave wanting to return anytime soon. Been there twice, been stuffed full of tasty food twice. Just thinking about the place makes me hungry.Pretty much everything on the brunch menu is good: poached eggs, grits, thick-cut bacon. But the winner: Skillet Eggs, Bacon, Spinach, and Gruyere buttered sourdough toast.The decorations add a bunch of character: artwork, taxidermy, pots hanging from the walls, stairs that go nowhere. The alley entry is a nice, unique approach. This is a cool place to show off, since it's out of the way for most people who are not familiar with the East Village (I include myself). Unfortunately, that probably means it will soon become way too popular.Just make sure to get there early on the weekends, because they don't take reservations for small groups, and the place fills up quickly. Came back to Freeman's this weekend and sat at the bar for a quick breakfast, bar tender was attentive, quick service and not bad to look at ;) I ordered the chocolate chip pancakes (soooo good)! Their coffee is still to die for! I've come here for brunch a few times-initially just really wanted to see the artsy alley and take cute photos. It ended up becoming one of my favorite brunch spots in Brooklyn. Freeman's may look tiny from the outside, but there are multiple, interesting cabin-esque dining rooms inside, and we've never really had to wait a painful amount. Their servers are friendly and I've never had an unpleasant encounter, despite how crazy busy they typically are.Their cocktail selection is awesome - I've never had a bad drink here. We always get the cheesy-artichoke dip to start. I could eat those all friggin day. Their Mac n Cheese is baked perfectly and their pancakes could feed two. We've yet to come here for dinner, but it isn't exactly the most convenient location-wise. I'd recommend this place to those looking to spice the vibe up for brunch. The taxidermy on the walls aren't as intimidating as it sounds on Yelp. They did some things really well, but one basic dish not done right is the main reason for the low rating. The mac and cheese was guilty good. The trout was surprisingly juicy and true to its natural flavors with simple seasoning. The steak tasted so dry and rubbery, a mere two bites was too nuch before it was sent back to the kitchen. Absolutely clueless why they would serve it at all... especially for a restaurant of this level. Surprised they would still charge it on the bill. Disappointed neither the server nor the chef came to explain. Thoroughly enjoyed the fillet mignon, delicious cocktails too - I recommend the Fog Horn:gin, pernod, jalapeno, rosemary, lime This place is amazing! The french fries  are very heavenly. The design is also very interesting. On the outside, it doesn't look like much. But the food and inside is awesome. The one thing I don't like is that there is no WiFi, even though I didn't use it. Was in NY for the weekend and this spot kept coming up as a recommendation when I searched for brunches. I got a vegetable omelette (comes with a mixed green salad) and a biscuit. Omelet was kind of rubbery, salad and biscuit were just ok. The ambiance is great though so it's worth visit- save it for a visit during the winter since there's no outdoor seating. They have a ton of taxidermy on the walls and it's very cozy. Entrance is down an alley. I'm assuming people really come here for the ambience.  The food is average and nothing to come back for a second time.  I came here with some friends for brunch and came to find out that they had no Almond or Soy Milk, out of most dishes on the menu and the maple syrup they make was just ok.  I would have preferred Almond Milk with coffee and some decent maple syrup.  The waiter was either sleep walking while waiting our table or just had no personality.  Isn't that something you look for when hiring staff?  I ordered an omelette and some pancakes which were both average and left me hungry when I left the restaurant.  Maybe come in for a drink and to check out the decor. Pros:Homey vibe. But if you're creeped out by taxidermy, don't go. Entrance is photo-worthy and cute.Not $$$ prices, more like $$. Large amount of space inside (though it's mostly at the bar if you don't want to wait).Cons:Food isn't that good. I got the Egg White Omelet ($14), and the broccoli was surprisingly embedded in the omelet. The combination of broccoli and cheese was unappetizing. Salad on the side was decent though. My friend got the Smoked Trout ($17) and that, the little olive-like things on the side, and mini pickles were all too salty. Only the cheeseburger ($17) tasted really good. The secret sauce, which might actually be hollandaise sauce, went well with the lettuce and patty. However, even though the patty was Medium Rare, the outside was partially burnt. Fries were thin and crispy. Artichoke dip ($15) is good though, as the reviews have raved about. But eating bread from that, then having bread from the Smoked Trout was too much. Service was good and water was filled promptly by bartender. Luckily the appetizer took a while to eat and when we were almost done, our main dishes came at that moment. I probably wouldn't come again, as I don't like the animals looking at me and there's nothing special about the food, besides maybe the dip. I have so many positive things to say about this place! It is in the back of Freeman's alley and is so cute! The decor and ambiance are so nice and intimate. For the food: The service is always amazing and you will never be waiting on your food! I've been there for brunch and dinner and both are amazing!!!! Brunch: Pancakes or their eggs with hash browns and bacon never fails! I'm sure the other options are all delicious as well! Dinner: Cheeseburger, any of the sandwiches, etc. I've been going to this place for years and the quality is always superb. Basically the food is seriously TASTY. JUST GO! We ended up here because there wasn't a wait... Its located at the end of a private alley filled with graffiti.  The decor is VERY rustic and cool.  Its a dark, cozy old house with several different rooms hidden away and decorated in their own quirky, outdoorsy manner.IF YOU LOVE BRUNCH COCKTAILS GO HERE!  The pre-designed cocktails are great!  I was craving cucumber so the bartender created something original with Mezcal and it was perfect!  I had a squash salad filled with squashes I had never heard of before, and also the shrimp and grits, and waffles.  The shrimp and grits was a more coarse texture than I'm used to in the south but still very good.I appreciate that its hidden because it keeps it from being so touristy as most of the brunch destinations in Soho... Great setting for a nice long meetup with friends! Wow! Totally and completely disappointed with the experience we had at Freemans. It was my fault that I didn't look at the opening time correctly but we got there only about 20 minutes early. Because of the high reviews, we decided to walk around and wait until they opened.The service after we entered was friendly and efficient. We ordered the Mac &amp; Cheese and the Fish Sandwich for lunch. Honestly, both items left a lot to be desired. My husband who's a huge fan of Mac &amp; Cheese was even disappointed in this one as it was a bit gritty and the crumbly topping was kind of a let down. The Fish Sandwich was not much better; it was fairly small in size but I still didn't eat the whole thing. It came with fries which were on the greasy side, completely unappetizing.Overall, very disappointed! I had really high expectations but maybe their breakfast / brunch is better. Bummer too because the location was in an alley but still super cute. LOVED our friends bridal shower here this past weekend! Her aunt ordered a bunch of family style selections from the menu and it was delicious! The cheesy artichoke dip was so great- highly recommend for a starter! We also had French toast with maple syrup, squash salad and their House-Smoked Brisket sandwiches - the french fries were hot and crispy. They also brought out the egg white&amp;mushroom omelettes for the table. We had great service but we could have used 1 more waitress in the room- she seemed a bit overwhelmed with about 30 of us crammed into this back room. I definitely would like to go back- cool hidden location and the food was awesome!! Come to Freemans for the cocktails and the picturesque atmosphere. They are famous for their unique location down a charming, graffitied ally; slightly hidden but not difficult to find.Overall I am UNIMPRESSED with the food.The baked skillet eggs shakshuka was probably the most underwhelming that I've tried. It was neither spicy nor saucy...as shakshuka SHOULD BE and the eggs were poorly done. Two were underdone and one was overdone... How does that even happen. Smh *face palm*Also, I am unsure how or why the artichoke dip ($15) is popular because although it looked appetizing, it was greasy/oily rather than creamy. It made me nauseous. Honestly, I'm not an artichoke connoisseur but this cannot be what the good stuff tastes like.Freemans could be a good first date spot... you take her for a few cocktails, but don't wanna spent $$$ on dinner, (thankfully there's room at the bar), but at the same time you won't look cheap or boring because *ambiance* is A+ TL;DR: cute tiny space with good brunch, but no substitutions available on the weekends makes it a little tough for vegetarians. A friend and I came for brunch on Saturday and only had to wait 20-30 mins for a table, which I felt was very reasonable. There seemed to be a good number of options that could be vegetarian, i.e. If bacon or some meat were taken out or replaced, but when I asked, I was told that the kitchen didn't do replacements on the weekends bc they're so busy. Makes sense, but I was glad I'd never been here before bc that made a grand total of like 3 things I could eat. Lots of tasty looking sides, though - I could imagine this being a good group brunch place.My friend and I both got the poached eggs with cheesy grits and collard greens, as we're both from the South and miss grits. These were delicious and hit the spot - portion size was great and I felt satisfied but not overfilled. We both paid ~$20 and left feeling pretty happy. I'd come back but maybe with some non vegetarian friends who can appreciate the variety of options here a little better. Location: I finally made it here! Freeman is cute inside and out. Why outside, becuase they have this freeman alley which has many posters and graphs and fun drawings that you cannot stop taking photos. Why inside, the decoration is like Sitting in a farm at Colorado where hunters gather here discussing how they wanna hunt for this year. Foood: had their brunch. But the whole menu is available to choose. Of course, I had their most famous brunch. And I think  it's one of few brunch spot that their signature food tastes actually goodPrice: average Service: waitress is absolutely caring. She gave us privacy but always show on time whenever we need here. Overall: absolute good. N their lounge is incredible! 4 stars!I'd recommend come early tho! Came here cause of all the rave reviews on here. Ambiance was as expected - quaint and cozy. The food, however, was disappointing. I had the steak and eggs; the steak wasn't that tender or tasty at all. Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing, but expected better food for the price. I'd have to say this place is overpriced and overrated. Freeman's entire environment is why I gave this place a 4 stars. I've been dying to try the restaurant so when it was Sunday morning and i was staying at the Public hotel, I decided to give it a try. Their brunch menu isn't exactly the most extensive or include a lot of typical ""brunch"" options, but we ordered some blueberry pancakes, a salad, and a quiche.The services was very attentive and the food was decent. I'll have to come back for other meals!",https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4QicG9B7fT6J0YIB3lCJaw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XldgIEq77XMmprFXQhL94w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/58eyeVnD9VSQWkIqCW-How/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4Njogrk-E7xeV7gwsnyayg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LYxQXdJEAWRd3VfqXVHQag/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0o-aMOUXY19srXLf6UfCHQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5TmVTohl13C3iB9ExnfeQQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ql6S5ta_lq2wnVga1NqB5A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HqcMRxJLZdQz5zgArN3kUg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5e6Tm38KBBUrPEyPLdTvxA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0G-pS3BdN-EY6uk8-i46rA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/t-DjY018hvQvmXSrT8DwUQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/P3v0pbccm-A4dq5a-tld9w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/imAyyzpqPKOcr0mnU2zy2g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OvroLKYvSfOX7MERU023-w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NQmJEldjVwi_fFExHrVfsw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/I1B_mhb-cCVoBRxgNPCfDg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/incbE6AYZs0NEyt9HCWgeg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FH06ZQEPqv5FLSQiblGslw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UsQf9a9yXfmr8asUy_6ejA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mssUloId-zc1zsHuwwXbIw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zQARnroqEtzqppaC6cCSRw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OP-tmX5To3-TfDXZpbtvzQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/k3QoHFaC89P5uYzWIFYrtw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PLS2d7LnFF7XJD5vAFTCiw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UR_O97CKenM4sytYZtxcmw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3QEnCbaj2BGNoRWrj4JfAg/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/gaia-italian-caf%C3%A9-new-york,gaia-italian-caf%C3%A9-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Italian,NA,NA,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this restaurant!! This is my go to spot for super authentic Italian cuisine. The food is DELICIOUS! The only place that has this quality of food is in Italy itself.  I've ordered so many dishes here and they all come out cooked to perfection. Some favorites are the sviziosa, gnocchi, calzones, and Panninis. The space is small and not fancy...It can seat about 20 people. No reservations are needed at lunchtime but dinner always requires a reservation. It's always packed so expect a wait but it's really worth it. I've waited so long to try this place (a year) and finally had the opportunity tonight. It's adorable. It's unconventional and a bit gritty and tad unkempt but all it's imperfections contributed to the owner's nonchalant, no joke, no time to waste, stiff but oh-so-cool attitude. I say this with 0 sarcasm. I love her. I love how haphazard G's decor is. I love the fact they use ikea kiddie plastic ware with small red solo cups for water and how enormous and unapologetic their antipasti are thrown together with the only measurement of oil and Parm being A Lot. We had the bresoela carpaccio, pesto lasagna and spicy garlic spinach ravioli. I even love how they came out in oversized foamy aluminum ramekins under a wooden trivet. The carpaccio was a bit salty but it's cured meat with a good vinegar and plenty of Parmesan. I love the pesto lasagna- only needed a nice dash of sea salt. The ravioli was surprisingly spicy which almost never happens to someone who orders and lives to love hot and spicy. It wasn't perfect but G is that cool. The entire establishment of a one woman show that makes one go through the hoopla of reserving a time to make a reservation is actually ingenious. Once you've entered the door, all the mystique and regulation falls to the wayside- it's clear why G is so popular. She is only here to serve 2-3 hours of no frills good food in a sub-level almost secret club that was never there if you never got the invite.*to say that cost has nothing to do with the assessment would be naive. G is the best deal in town. The fact I had to report to her what we had and remind her to charge us for our drinks goes to show how busy she was and how this place is ran- in good faith* this place clearly does not want any business.  Rudest woman on the phone.  Good luck trying to make a reservation here.  I've called countless times and no one answers.  Twice now I have called and an actual person has picked up- neither of these times has my reservation been taken (reservation for weeks in advance mind you).  I called at 4:57pm to make a dinner resveration for a month from now.  The restaurant's hours are until 7pm.  The woman who answered the phone said they only take reservations until 5 (??? how does that make sense when it is open until 7 and this is a reservation for weeks out??) and since it was 4:57 it was too close to 5 to take my reservation and to call back tomorrow.Would have liked to try this place but not after the attitude I received on the phone.  Maybe this place should get with opentable or resy if they're not going to endure the labor of writing down a reservation from a phone call.  You're not that exclusive and your restaurant is never full, just thought I'd follow your policy that's listed on your website of calling in a res ahead of time.rude rude rude Just found this as we were close by. The first time I walked in. I headed towards to counter thinking there might be a waitlist as people were waiting in front. After getting there, the owner told us to get towards the back (near the door) to avoid blocking people. Which is fine, but was said in a little rude tone but it was understandable. I know they were trying to work at a fast pace to accommodate the amount of people coming. But after waiting about 20+ minutes, I would at least expect better service and cleaner plates. I had a total of 4 people and one of the waitress said 2 of us can sit first while waiting for the next table to finish and clear up. That didn't happen as one said we had to order or give our seats up for the next customers (that just got here recently). As for the food, it was decent for the pricing but the portions are small. I shared two dishes with my friend (2). We got meat lasagna (had good bread with it// soft and warm) and meatballs n potatoes (bread was cold and ok). Priced at $10 and $8. The total was around $19-20. It didn't fill us up but that's alright. I don't think the food was too bad but the service could be better. The owner was a lot kinder towards the end, but in the beginning it wasn't the best. It was a rough afternoon I guess. Not the best start to our day. A no frills affordable, BYOB Italian restaurant.  I found this restaurant on Yelp and decided to try it because of the high ratings.  I already knew the lack of customer service was a sore spot because of all the complaints but wanted to have an open mind and experience for myself.  I browsed Gaia's website and knew about their unique policies. Reservations had to be made beforehand so I called and spoke to the owner/chef, she was pretty dismissive and borderline rude (""You need a reservation!  Didn't you read the website?!""  Umm yes, that's why I'm calling!) but I made a reservation for 5:30pm, although my first instinct was to hang up!  I'm grateful I made that decision but didn't know that at the time.  I was worried the restaurant would turn out to be a disaster!My husband and I arrived at the restaurant, wary of the appearance.  Talk about a hole in the wall/basement!  There wasn't a host/hostess to greet us and barely a glance from the cooks in the kitchen.  We found a table with my name on a card and sat.  I opened the bottle of wine we bought (from a liquor store across the street) and started drinking.  No corkage fee, 1 star!  After looking through the menu we decided on the dinner for 2 ($40 for a medium Antipasto Italiano Plate, Bruschetta, Pasta of the Day, and a little dessert) and ordered at the counter.  Someone would bring each course out to us but no one came to clean up in between. If a dish was being brought out and we had finished plates, they'd get taken away.  Most of the time, I just brought the used dishes to the front counter.  Once we got over the abrupt but prompt service, we devoured our meal and really enjoyed it.  My husband ate most of ithe foodand I was still stuffed!  The food was authentic, simple and delicious.  I felt like we were eating in someone's home, not a restaurant.  We ordered a cappuccino in addition to the cookies that were brought out to us as part of the meal.  No regrets with anything we ordered.  It hit the spot without breaking the piggy bank!Overall, I'd give Gaia 4 stars because the food was delicious and priced so well.  This restaurant is a hole in the wall, service is questionably lacking to the point of defiant but it's worth going to for a super laid back and scrumptious meal. We ordered the chicken ""Milanese"" panino and mushroom truffle ravioli. The panino was 3.5/5 stars. The sandwich's chicken cutlets were small though the chicken it did have was well-executed: juicy, well seasoned, crisp on the bite of the crust. The bread was thick, soft, and light crisp on the exterior. Unfortunately the bitter arugula dominated the flavor profile and made the pesto and tomatoes at most an afterthought. The ravioli on the mushroom truffle ravioli was handmade, lightly chewy, and just the right taste. The mushrooms inside were savoury, well-seasoned, and juicy. These were complemented well by earthy romano cheese shavings on top. The sauce was a medium-bodied bechamel with hints of truffle oil. Light sprinkling of parsley balanced the cream and fat of the sauce with a fresh and green flavor and mouthfeel. The ravioli was good enough to redeem the failures made on the panino, but not enough to make the experience 5 stars. Hole in the wall type of place that serves one of the best Italian food I've tried. No frills - you order and pay at the counter. They give you plastic plates, utensils, and cups. We came on a Thursday at 5pm, and there was no problem with seats. By 630, the place was filling up. We saw a bunch of people bring their own bottles, so it's BYOB people! Can't get any better than that. We got their dinner for two special, which includes the antipasto, bruschetta, pasta of the day, and dessert. It was $40, which was a good price for the amount of food we got.The antipasto was amazing! I wanted to buy the cheese from them, but they said it's from Italy, and they don't sell it anymore due to shortage. Sniff. The bruschetta is make your own, so they give you a bunch of toppings (Eggplant, artichoke, peppers, olives etc) and you decide what to put on your toasted bread. Both of them were so good that we had to get another serving. They were both different, which made it even more interesting because we got to try different cheeses and meats. The pasta of the day included buffalo cheese ravioli, and that was fantastic. Each day they have specialties, so I'll upload the menu that explains it all. We also ordered the lasagna, and loved it as well. They were both so flavorful that you just had to dip the bread in the sauce. The dessert is just an assortment of what cookies they have, which made a great accompaniment to the cappuccinos we ordered. She sure knows how to make a great cup of coffee. Overall, amazing food experience and service that we can't wait to go back on different days to try out different pastas! Since I moved uptown I had not been to Gaia for a while. Today I was so pleased to see the restaurant very busy with lots of happy customers. A friend and I ordered crab meat salad, bruschetti, burratina, and the pasta special (orecchiette with gorgonzola and tomato). Every dish was perfect (I might be spelling some wrong). We could not finish any of the dishes and the whole thing was around $50. The owner is very kind with a beautiful personality. Will definitely try to come down more often. Gaia Italian Caf is a small hidden restaurant that specializes in Italian food at unbeatable prices.TIPS:-Reservation mandatory after 5pm, no other option.FOOD (5/5):The food here is very good. I recommend ordering several options for the table and splitting them amongst yourselves. My recommendations are -Fico Panini: fig goat cheese, tomatoes, prosciutto di Parma-Mushroom ravioli special: mushroom filled ravioli in a spicy tomato sauce (medium portion)PRICE (5/5): Here is the kicker for this establishment, most of the food is around $10. If you are traveling NYC on a budget, Gaia's is a must-go.SERVICE (2/5):Unfortunately very rude service from the cashier. Hopefully it was just one worker &amp; not represented by the whole staff. I had such high hopes for this place. I made reservations (because it's a must for dinner) on a Thursday because it was gnocchi and ravioli day (my favorite types of pasta). We ended up getting only one item from the special daily menu because the top choice was out. That item was the shrimp ravioli with brussel sprouts in lemon sauce. The shrimps were ridiculously tiny and just not pleasant to eat. The ravioli itself was ordinary. The brussel sprouts were cooked funny -- I was expecting charred and flavorful. Disappointing and waste of $14. Don't ever get shrimp dishes there.The pesto lasagna, $10, was pretty good, but it didn't blow away. It looks better than it tastes. The spinach ricotta gnocchi was basically just balls of spinach and ricotta. Maybe I just don't know what gnocchi is. It was also $10 for 5. Finally, the bread. Ew. It was hard, old, greasy. But it came with the meal and the sauces were good... and you needed something to eat the sauce with since the pasta was so minimum. Just disappointing. Were looking for Italian for a late lunch.  Gaia popped up on yelp and reviews looked good.  Had a long cold walk to get there but it was worth it!!  Entrance is below street level and we almost missed it.  Took the stairs down and entered the small cafe.  Nothing fancy here, but sure looked like a neighborhood place, which was perfect.  There wasn't a table free (there are only 9), so we had to wait a bit.  That gave us time to look over the menu.  Eventually we were seated (after a young couple slid over to another table so we would have room for the additional chair we needed at ours).  We started with an arugula salad that was fantastic.  Large serving, great flavors.  Then we split a meat lasagna and spinach gnocchi.  They were both good (I didn't do much with the gnocchi- they were indeed spinach, and I'm just not that big a fan.  That gave me a chance to go back up to the counter (order and pay there) and get a Delicato panini - provolone, ham and mozzarella- was really great.  Visited with other diners who confirmed that the food is always great.  Pasta dishes come served in metal bowls on wood plates.  Bowls are very hot, so your dish stays warm  the entire meal.  Service was a bit laid back, but that just added to the charm of the place.  Got to talk with the owner when I paid the bill (all that for only $35!) - she was sweet and thankful we chose her establishment.  Thinking about going back tomorrow! Good food but service is lacking. They have to come up with a better of getting folks in and out. We ordered coffee but never got our sweetener and coffee went cold so we drank it so could wrap our meal.  And wrapping up we had to line up to pay. A few visits to Gaia made obtaining a meal here feel like I riddled the sphinx, or broke the DaVinci code, or actually saved up for a trip to Italy. I arrived at lunch a little late and ordered a spicy shrimp pasta dish.  It was served in a delightfully worn, dare I say beat up, silver pot, with a warming love, wonderfully baked pasta noodles and spicy shrimp in a rich tomato broth.It was dirt cheap and felt like a visit from grandma.  My soul quickly arrived to that spot named ""home"" on the soul dial as I sat in this sort of dingy little basement. The rough edges of Gaia are its charms - old world non pretense and a good home cooked meal.Here is a guide to the logistics ofobtaining a meal here -1. Lunch is the easiest time to eat here.    Check the website for when the kitchen      closes, which I think is around 2:30pm.2. Dinner is reservation only and served     within a time window between 5pm and     7:30pm.    You cannot just walk in and eat dinner under any circumstances. This is such a great hole in the wall!! It's in a basement on Houston Street so some people might miss it initially. I made a reservation for 2 on a Thursday at 5:30 PM. There were only two other tables seated when we came. We walked up to the counter and they informed us that we should seat ourselves and order at the counter when we were ready. We ordered a panini to share, and two entrees. They brought the food over to us when it was ready.The Milanese Panini ($7) was so delicious. It was chicken cutlet, arugula, tomatoes, and pesto sauce between two slices of crispy bread. The bread was so crispy and the chicken cutlet was seasoned just right. The pesto sauce, arugula, and tomatoes came together so well. I ordered the Meat Lasagna ($10). Some reviews on yelp mentioned that it was too salty?? But I thought it was just right - if anything, it could use a little more salt. The lasagna was covered with tomato sauce which i used to dip the complimentary bread they provided for us. My friend ordered the Pesto Lasagna ($10). I had a little sample it was just as delicious! I would recommend this place for lunch if you're ever in the area. For dinner, they have a special for two people for $40. It comes with an antipasto plate, bruschetta, pasta of the day, and a small dessert. And, you must make reservations if you wish to come in for dinner (more details on their website). Came in here for a late breakfast, they had a decent amount of options to choose from which sounded like they'd make a good breakfast (vegetarian paninis). Got my self a Mediterranean (which is spelled in Italian on the menu). Goat cheese, tomato, red bell peppers, oils and a nice crunchy bread. Absolutely delicious. The bread was fresh and crunchy without being burnt. The goat cheese had a great taste and texture to it. Tomatoes where nice and acidic. I don't like bell peppers but ate them anyway because they actually complimented the panini. Place is pretty small but cute and intimidate, real hole in the wall kind vibe.Portion was really generous, especially when you realize the thing sells for 5 bucks. Reviews on here are pretty consistent about food and service. With food being consistently good and service not so much. I kinda got where that was coming from. The lady is a bit rough around the edges, and if you're not used to it I can see why it would be negative. But seriously, don't take everything at face value, she is pretty nice and how she speaks doesn't make the food taste any better or worse.5/5 because Place is really cute Plenty of options Food tastes great Price is reasonable Service was quick and orderly It's a super hole in the wall type of place; you wouldn't think it was a restaurant if you were just passing by. You walk down a flight a stairs to enter, and upon walking in everything is super vintage. We had made a reservation for 5:30PM on a Thursday, but it really wasn't needed because we were able to sit wherever we wished. You order your food at the counter and then they bring it to your table. It's also BYOB! Amongst my friend &amp; I, we got a Milanese Panini ($7!!!) to share - this was probably my favorite menu item that I tried. The 'bread' of the panini was more of a cracker, the chicken was cooked nicely, and I love pesto over anything so it complimented the sandwich well. In addition, we also got a Pesto Lasagna ($10!!!) and Meat Lasagna ($10!!!). These were just mediocre, I think it lacked flavor and salt. They also give you some bread to dip in your sauce. After we paid, we were also given some complimentary Italian cookies. Overall, I would come back because you can't really beat the prices. For the two of us, it was roughly $29, which is unbelievable for both Italian food and the LES. Customer service is also not amazing, but couldn't complain. bunch of my girlfriends recommended this small italian restaurant to me so i had to try it out and now its one of my favorite restaurant to go!! its not expensive and the employees are friendly. my helpful tips~ -you have to make reservations after 5:30pm, it's a small cute restaurant and they get pretty busy. -it's BYOY( love it lol). no cork fee! -you have to order your food to the cashier and they bring it out to your table. -they make different special everyday. they're all so delicious. we (party of 2) ordered three different dinner special &amp; one cheese ham small plate. everything was delicious and of course we brought a bottle of red wine. there's a word for combining wine and dinner - it's winner! The Illy coffee (I've had two cappuccinos) is outstanding and the pesto lasagna is truly perfetto and my favorite restaurant food in all of NYC.  We would have licked our metal bowls clean if that were acceptable public behavior!  Word to the wise: this place has an information page and rules to follow.  Some unfortunate folks have great difficulty understanding that the world does not revolve around them and display abrasive manners.Gaia's efforts are a gift to anyone with good manners and a heart open enough to appreciate the tremendous deliciousness.  Mi piacciono molto!!! I really really wanted to love Gaia but it's just alright in my books. I've come on three separate occasions and each time, I felt like there was a little something missing. Gaia is a particular woman and wants you to enjoy her food her way. I would recommend checking out the ""Informations"" page on her website before dining. If you're cool with it then she's cool with you. When you walk into the cafe, feel free to drop your belonging off at a table. Then, make your way up front to check out the menu/daily specials and place your order. You pay after the meal. They'll hand you some utensils for you to take back to your table, but they will bring out your food.During my visits here, I've tried their antipasto italiano con focaccia, arugula salad, panini, and homemade pastas and lasagnas. Their food is decent, especially for the portion and the price. However, the pastas and lasagnas I have had could have used more salt. The other dishes were good, but not amazing. Overall, Gaia serves up a nice selection of Italian comfort foods at a good price, especially for the city. However, having been spoiled by $9 pasta at Il Corvo, in Seattle, I'm a pretty tough critic when it come to delicious pasta at a value. If you're looking for good Italian food, this is the place to go. Be sure to read the rules of the restaurant before coming. Simple rules like don't ask to alter the menu. What you see is what you get. When one member of our party asked to change the pasta, the guy taking our order was patient and explained the rules to him, however I got the feeling he was a little annoyed. The bread sticks are so amazing! Don't bother asking for seconds, they know how much to give each person. I did take a star off because the plastic cup they provided me still had lipstick on it. Thankfully I had my own water bottle and used that. Overall the meal was flavorful and authentic. Would come again next time I'm in New York.",https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZxwgEhJsN_mD1iC_MM20Mw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KHtTjOiiu_F8trRIj_ID3w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WDeMsWFzlnpkdOBUfCjVRw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5__bhdRWAWB85j1h9ju4Iw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Mizd2hjQIkp97EcKSIxexg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/87iwkKDmghiKHJXhAlk1jg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vrzyT93evfnbmkQDr2rSqA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/clHP7d7-lZOch_HJFMJZVQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NNj0VWEdm-SpfD4yw_6o7A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/v07qOqMDOwMrQIXJPEXXoQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Rbg4tA490GStSdYYgFWOOA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XwLdBf-KW-M84GztG5vG9A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BTS1bwO_HztKOqChFIAwaA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MzCBcliyhodvoBcZ2lwwWQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VIggw7s70mTZXDMQMMLA_Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fVhVwdadP8dUf5AfEXLZzg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/97Nop6xYS2X48LPSfd6rZQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/r1Xg-BzFBxlKZueyohXzZg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qXGkEgU9urxwDboBDZ58bw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pIDOZb1YSbejglpJNNoNBQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WSKMBM5tkQSlcIp2GhedvA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XICyT2pswfh0MKYU-YVtbg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1sz56W1qXjN18bZY--ymWA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qjVzbBIqX6LaCJSnQpcefw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8-Qt_REPxJWZmn9CMYIR6Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jPJtG-yPaXrSd1k-TsakOA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nXd_36LFjtPnPPZj3PVsrg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pLSuG2OU7Cmu4Ienmx2eAA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/coGmiUVKVuGeJOD-qXV4xg/258s.jpg,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/goa-taco-new-york,goa-taco-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Fast Food,Tacos,Indian,"Not your typical taco joint but equally as good!  The fillings are placed in paratha ""shells"" which are slightly crisp.  Something to try if you've never gone do before. I had the pork belly and beef mojo today.  Both were amazing and I'll definitely be back to try the others- particularly the paneer! Stopped by here for a quick lunch. The front can get easily get packed but there is a dining area behind the counter on the right side. We ordered the saag paneer, beef mojo, and pork belly tacos. All three were different and tasted delicious. My husband thought the two meat tacos were filled with good flavor. It's a great idea they have fusing Mexican and Indian foods together. My favorite was the saag paneer. It had such great texture and full of flavor than the meat tacos. Their scotch boonet hot sauce was amazing. It was full of flavor for a hot sauce with a good amount kick that helped cut the heavy flavors of the tacos.It can be a bit messy to eat. We didn't see utensils. The pouches the tacos come in may fold out to a plate but we ended up using the stack of napkins on the table. Goa Taco, you are my ambitionYou satisfy taste and nutritionRed squash and sweet honeyYou're sure worth the moneyOh please, come again to fruition I didn't know what a ""paratha"" was until I came here. It sounded like a cannibalistic fish or something. This is one of the best tacos I have ever had, probably the best. The best. Yeah, the best.I mean, they're in a league of their own though...is it even fair? Usually I hate paying more than $2 for a taco, but I was totally fine with paying $6 for this one. It was like 4 tacos in one. I had the mojo beef with pinto bean puree, smoked jalapeno and plantain chips. Plantain chips in a taco.My god.The crunch.My partner in crime had spinach pesto, garam masala fried chickpea and pickled tomatillo in hers and it was good as well. Fried chicpeas...what a time to be alive.Are you alive? Then why are you still here? Go get some chicpeas and smash then call it hummus! I never flummox! I don't understand the hype... it's a Malaysian paratha which you can buy from Indian grocery stores, stuffed with very basic things you can get at home and make yourself. My main issue was that I badly wanted to try the paneer taco (in the mood for vegetarian) but they ran out of paneer (why!), and settled for the tofu one instead - which I absolutely do not recommend. But overall I'm just not seeing what's so great about this... it's like a Kati roll but with a Malaysian paratha and in taco form with a cute envelope packaging. I'm not sure if the other tacos will be able to get there with the flavors when they failed tremendously with the one I tried. I do believe the price is reasonable for NYC, meal itself is filling, but just heard too many good things and did not meet expectations. I will say that I found their hot sauce intriguing - it was WAY SPICIER than I imagined it to be Service was good, he was a very nice server. Not sure I'll be back... I ordered the Tofu Banh Mi Taco (thinking it was the lighter option) since we actually just came from brunch but wanted to try Goa since it was right down the street. The mushroom pate was tasty and the overall taste was very fresh. I enjoyed the paratha but it probably would've tasted better with one of the warmer options. The taco was overflowing so it was a little hard to eat, especially since we were sharing as well. But overall it was pretty good and I'd come again for one of their other tacos! I went here based on previous rave reviews. I am sad to say that I was underwhelmed. I ordered the chorizo taco and my best friend had the pork belly taco. For $8 each, the tacos weren't all that big. The toppings and the taco shell were unique and delicious. The meats however were just okay. I enjoyed my chorizo sausage but the pork belly did not look or taste like pork belly, more like pork loin. The concept was great so A for effort. We were hungry and wanted something delicious and cheap in the city. We couldn't decide between The Halal Guys or here, but I probably will not return to Goa Taco in the future. These are seriously the best (nontraditional) tacos in New York! So delicious, they are in this fried pita bread that is so tasty with whatever meat you order. The pork belly is the crowd favorite - but I preferred the lamb shoulder because it wasn't as fatty. The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was fun and effortless. I also had the house sangria which surprisingly was pretty good and strong! Can't wait to go back - delicious treat! I was wandering the city one Friday night when I realized I hadn't eaten anything that day. Pulled up my bookmarks and found that I was only a block away from goa taco!I like Indian food. I like tacos. What I got, was Indian food in the shape of a taco. It's basically a kati roll in the shape of a taco. They take a paratha, which is like a flaky tortilla and stuff it with Indian food. I got the tofu bahn mi and palak paneer tacos. Both were pretty good and both were vegetarian. The excessive amounts of ghee keeps them from being vegan though goa taco is the perfect late night greasy meal you need in your life after a night in grungy LES.The tacos are made with paratha which is the same texture as a scallion pancake, the Indian roti they offer at Chinese restaurants (I dunno why?!?) or perhaps if your tortilla was fried first. They manage to stuff so many ingredients in this little paratha to where it is a bit messy. It's not the easiest especially if you've been raging recently. But the little specially designed goa pocket helps.I have enjoyed myself almost all of the taco options and they're all solid. My favorites are the tofu banh mi and the paneer. I can't eat more than one of these suckers but sharing is caring. Next time you're here share the wealth! I had the pesto paneer one. It was great! So filling!!! A goa taco and a drink for just $7? Good deal!!By time I ate only half of it, I was already full.It's a walk-in place but there is a doorway into a bar / Lounge where I sat and eat. I went there mid September on a Friday afternoon and it was dead, but that's not a reflection of the food at all.Amazing Fusion food. You must give this place a try Delicious taco that's very much like a scallion pancake packed with your choice of filling. I ordered the pork belly taco, which comes with pickled cabbage, chipotle mayo, and 2-3 nice long slices of pork belly for $8. It's more of a heavy snack as opposed to a meal, but if you're a light eater it should be perfect portions. Though I don't believe this type of taco is very indian since it reminds me of flavors that hit close to home (xiaobing?), I did love it nonetheless. The shell was crispy, warm, and not oily at all. It was folded nicely and snugly tucked into their cardboard which you can rip apart to facilitate a less messy eating process - but trust me, bits and pieces will still fall down. Some things guess can't be salvaged I guess. Very excited to try their cheese paneer taco next! Small sit down store with seating right in front of the cashier. If you don't mind having them eaves drop on your conversation, or you're simply stopping by for a quick bite that shouldn't really matter right :). Yum yum yum yum yum yum! I had the pork belly and the mojo beef! Tears of joy...that paratha bread taco is crispy and buttery.Make sure you try what you like because I can't imagine it ALL BEING GOOD! Woah! Was my first thought when I took a bite out of the taco. I really didn't know what to expect. When I think tacos, my Bay Area, CA raised self thinks al pastor on tortilla shells. I don't go out of my way for anything but Mexican tacos.However, I've recently moved to the area and the boy came to visit and really wanted to try this place.  So it's actually a paratha shell meaning its crispy and sort of like the texture of a green onion pancake (Chinese food lovers can relate). The size of them are the size of 2 tacos.We had the pork belly and the lamb and pork belly was definitely my favorite. I'd give this place a try! Brunch, lunch, dinner, or late late night, it's always a good snack. I would take these paratha tacos over regular tacos anyday! The shell is incredibly flaky, and all the filling on the inside comes out hot. I chose the brunch taco this time (i believe it's a special, so check with them to see if it's available), which came with bacon, fried egg, peppers, and this spicy mayo...YUM. Not the cheapest, but super super delicious and I would totally come back! I also shared a churro with my friend, i think they use the same paratha shell to wrap around the chocolate hazelnut filling instead of the traditional way of making a churro. Really yummy too. It was a little steep, at $2.76 per churro (it's a mini one!), wish it came with multiple in the cone.The cute space is pretty small, but when I got there, there were a lot of seats open (there's 4 bar counter seats inside, and a couple of tables outside). Goa Taco is awesome! Its quick service for a healthy taco, all their meats are antibiotic and hormone free, which I really appreciate. Their lamb taco especially is so freakin good! The sauce the soft lamb and the paratha taco combined is really great. Love the idea and the taste. Not a huge fan of presentation and inflexibility of the food. Although I ate it accordingly from the far end of the taco, my friend prefers to eat hers from above and make her way down. It just got messy and drippy. I had the paneer. The taco shell is fried and a bit oily but worth it because it was crispy. The flavors compliment and does not compete against each other. Chips and verde sauce was good. A new location has just opened on Macdougal, serving the same concise menu of great Paratha tacos.They're all delicious, but I went with the Chicken Chorizo this time. The flaky paratha shell is soft and buttery and makes a for a really different and delicious experience than you would except from something called a taco. Hopefully they last longer here than Piece of Velvet did, because the food is great. One Friday night, the boyfriend and I decided to try a new  place for dinner outside of our usual comfort foods. Requirements: had to be around soho/chinatown, had to be tasty, had to be below $20/pp. After a quick search on google maps and yelp, we settled on goa taco. At first, we were confused with the restaurant description. What is an Indian taco anyways? As it turns out, instead of the regular taco skin, goa serves their tacos with paratha (prata?) which is a buttery, flaky pancake not unlike a Chinese scallion pancake. We ordered the mojo beef and the slow roasted pork belly. The mojo beef had great flavor and was a little spicy. The Indian spices used definitely complemented the taste of the paratha. On the other hand, the pork belly tasted refreshingly light, although the pork was a little dry. The pickled red cabbage gave the taco a great crunch and kept it from being too heavy as the paratha is pretty oily. The total for this meal was less than $20The next day was not a great day for the boyfriend. He is positively certain that the cause of his indigestion were the tacos and it is with great dismay that I have to knock a star off this review. I found Goa Taco through Meal Pal. Although Delancey was a little bit of a hike from my work - delicious vegetarian tacos are worth traveling for.These are ""paratha"" style tacos, Paratha = crossaint + tortilla; LIFE CHANGING.The Bahn Mi taco and the Saag Paneer are amazing. The guac and chips are a little pricey for a small amount of guac and a massive amount of chips - however - the taco was so delicious, all was forgiven. I am now a regular :)",https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/e0wfnyBWhd__pXOOzheH3Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dPMPFuE4seq5thLBfuDnjQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/61VzwZtZDL_mepV9Mj40OA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LbBNauxLrRQzcRiizcbwbw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uNi5eOrIh3bLFaxNjutQnw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/138xfKJZ4g3vhLi2va8hxA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Qb-gcSK6U70fRiossuxupg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7BbC8xxTyQFIiQVGe1_8Lg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0XQQMdLVB94UBHXrVAIOeg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OMX4vVR-z5WdlaPeMDpQ-Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/I3EiIPVAHjHw5l2lQtTEkQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/W1OXL7gkmlB_e80xgtS0Kg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Lr3V1JH3-9wJFyrZlUVONw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tLXsiPyu65h7p1LAyMDmsQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BvrrZ988Wnt-KT3T8asCiQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3DIFu-NOV7ZMQ9RKMd-FOQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gNzMvUwSeMlS0q1YCt7qXA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/krd-G5Q70REXaSdSFGoHEg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Dy4pVfp643OO-X4A0NAAwA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bjEmC91OULFjWz3SntFbng/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VuQSgkV9MHHFApZMc2oZIg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Sm-BAhKbqNIWvlowUTxRZA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/X8fRQWJXHUUDRWqoZHt-Uw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/n3PXllACiT1GYoABb_Gynw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uNd_h9soN4m9e20yJLylrg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/q6IpIMSiWGrqsS3mSEq4xQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hATLqNsrsB2uIrrqgkWqwA/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA

Prohibited chemical used/stored. Open bait station used. I've been coming here for many years and I've got to say that the food has improved. Fhe food has remained consistantly good from the 3-4 visits I've made recently.I always get 'Chasu Wonton Noodles' and the first time I had it was that it was ok but now.. wow! Noodletown must've hired a new chef because the difference in how the food was cooked was noticable. The chasu before was nowhere near as good as it is now and it's something I recommend getting as a plate or in your noodle bowl. The food really got better and I highly recommend coming. The food portions remain the same iirc. I mean, the ""Grade Pending"" sign probably should have been enough to make us stay away, but after a drink or two one does not make the best decisions. We all ordered the wonton noodle soup and it was ok. I guess it would hit the spot if you were really really drunk but I definitely was not drunk enough. The shrimp dumplings were actually pretty good until one of my friends pulled out what looked a piece of newspaper out of hers. It's probably like when you go to the deli and they wrap your meat in butcher paper. I've seen the Chinese grocery stores wrap stuff in newspaper, but who wants icky newspaper ink on their shrimps? I try not to endorse this place too hard because it's already hard for me to get a seat when I want one.  But this place is one of the examples I would cite if I had to prove life was inherently good, humanity deserved to exist, heaven should be like earth, etc.. Nihilists and optimists alike, poor and scathingly rich NYU students, Manhattanite affluence, aging NYTimes reviewers in drab dinner jackets, corporate thrillseekers drunk on success and Prosecco, hostel-hoppers with grubby backpacks, and the occasional Chinese person can be seen packing themselves into the narrow spaces they call tables here.  The line to get in to eat, or to escape the cold while you to-go order cooks forms a mob across the front door fire-hazard style, making it impossible to see anything the customers might be eating inside the restaurant. All you can see from outside is the selection of roasted meats hanging from the ceiling, the cashier's plateau next to a chef with a large knife and a wonton soup station. This is often obscured by full clouds of steam pouring from the rice cooker and the bone broth, and the hasty breath of so many people inside slurping their noodles and gasping in surprise with each bite.  There is something about this place which nourishes the soul.  It seems like a warm bath in the dead of winter, even if you come here in the summer.  Somehow its ability to warm the void remains as you roll in your own sweat May through September.  But I fear I've said too much.  I've said most of it before, but I try to keep it brief, keeping the spiritual side of this experience to myself. The food is magnificent, authentic perhaps not to China but to being here, to living a life in this area where this is the place you end up after heartily celebrating your own existence.  The bone broth really struck me this time, which I don't usually drink because it has noodles in it and is very porky.  This time the collagen cried out to me.  The pig and I formed a chemical bond as our bones became one.  I might ask to be cremated and have my ashes added to the incense holder at the traditional altar.  Or just Char Siu me. My thighs would look great hanging from that window, glistening with sticky sugar and steam.  If I think of this place before entering oblivion, I will smile. Excellent duck and roast Pork.  Found the place toBe a bit dirty the last time I went and I just heard from my cousin that they are closed due to health code violations.  I'm sure it will be much cleaner when they open up.  They have been there for ages... I came here for dinner with friends. Food was great, service was not. My friends and I ordered a lot of things to share: roasted baby pig; mushrooms with foo noodles; salt baked calamari; salt baked scallops; fried rice with roast duck and pineapple; and salted pea shoots. Everything was delicious. The salt baked calamari and scallops were definitely a favorite because the flavor palate was so different. The salted pea shoots were surprisingly addicting. And the mushrooms with foo noodles was perfectly cooked. Service was terrible. We were ignored for a long time after we sat down. We had to stop a few people, not sure who our waiter was, in order to order food. Some of the servings are very large and when we asked for a knife to cut meat and mushrooms, we got the impression they were not too pleased. We had to share one knife, which was fine, but when it appeared that we were finished with it, it was taken away from us. Also, our small table for four was given four special menus. At one point during the meal, a worker reached across our table, over our food, without asking, to grab special menus for other tables. At another point in the meal, another worker interrupted us, demanding that we provide more special menus. When we finished some plates, we were asked bluntly and impatiently if we were ordering more food or leaving. Overall, customer service is not a priority here. Please note that this place is BEER ONLY. However, they let you BYO Wine. Also, this place is CASH ONLY. Great little hole in the wall in Chinatown.Known for its BBQ meats and Noodles, this place is a great value spot.I got the three meats (crispy pork, char siu, roast duck) over rice.   All three were nicely done, tasty and meaty.My BF got the pan fried chicken lo mein, and it was a bit bland...not too much flavor....not a repeat dish.....for sure....The place is a bit cramped, not the cleanest place around (but again, this is NY Chinatown !!!).Service is prompt and efficient. Good little noddle spot, clean and prompt service. Single restrooms were nice, place was complete with hanging duck and pork in the window. Recommend the pork wonton noodle soup, seafood e-fu -all washed  down with a Tsingtao. I came here with my fam on a Sunday night. It was full and we had to wait about 20 min before being seated. The table of 8 that came in before us had to wait even longer, about an hour.We ordered a variety of things, but the ones that stuck out were the beef noodle soup and the roasted pig over rice - they're both so good! We also got the roasted duck over rice which was fattier and bonier but still good. We got the beef chow fun noodle dish because we saw the table next to us had it and it looked delicious. It was good, but I wouldn't be able to eat only that for a full meal and I probably wouldn't choose to order it again. We also got the Hong Kong style noodles with duck and that wasn't too flavorful so I wouldn't get it again either. Service was excellent! I look forward to coming back to try different dishes because I was only a fan of 2 of the 5 we ordered this time. I'll have to try the soft shell crab that everyone's talking about. Convenient spot for late night eats (usually get wonton noodle soup, a rice or stir fried noodle dish) after a night out on the town, however, last time I ate here (one week ago - January 2018); I had paper INSIDE the wonton I was served. Beware. This place is such a gem. It's rough on the edges but definitely a must have. My sister brought me to this spot in Chinatown a few weeks ago and I've loved it since. You walk in, you get shouted at to sit down, you're brought a pot of tea and the menus are placed underneath the glass table top on your table. I've had the baby bok choy and fell in love with it. My boyfriend loves the roast duck especially the green ginger sauce it comes with. You can order three meats over rice to find out what you like. We also tried to roast pork which is juicy and tender. My favorite is the beef and vegetables pan fried noodles. The noodles are sometimes really crunchy or have just enough crunch. It's a big portion, definitely something good to share. I always order a few things and share them with the table. Makes a good friend family din din. It's super casual. They give you oranges at the end with you bill- which I've always paid at the front by the register. I do look forward to coming back and trying the soft shell crab. I never know what to expect when eating in Chinatown, and I usually mentally prepare for the rude, loud, quick table turning experience before walking into any venue on or south of Canal, but this service was quite the opposite!  For a nearly empty restaurant on a wintery Friday night, they were over staffed, but none of the waiters wanted to help anyone.  All the waiters stared at the floor or talked to each other or went out for coffee.  Me and several other diners had to literally wave our hands after sitting for minutes for someone to decide to come help us (take our order, bring the check, you know, the basics!).  I even saw the chefs staring out into the restaurants wondering when the orders would actually be taken.  I ordered char siu wonton mein and salt &amp; pepper squid.  For my noodle soup, I was a bit surprised that the char siu looked and tasted like brisket.  Normally cooked from the loin, my pieces were marbled and broke much like brisket.  The wontons were ok, nothing out of the ordinary.  The broth did taste deeper and richer (and not like ""socks"") than some neighboring establishments.Salt &amp; pepper squid was questionable.  The batter and salt were good, pepper was a bit lacking.  Squid was also very firm.... and no tentacles served.  I once read an article that some Chinese restaurants serve pig colon instead of real squid... I couldn't get that article out of my mind when eating this dish.Eddie the Human Panda raves about this place.  While I wanted to love it, I left a bit confused by both the service and the food.  Nothing was really wrong, but nothing was really right either.  I'll put this one in the relatively large pile of mediocre hole in the walls of Chinatown. I tried the roast duck &amp; wonton lo mein today. Generally I think it's the No. 1 or No 2 in china town already. Recommended by my Cantonese colleague which means the taste has already reached a certain level. Normally it's difficult to find proper Cantonese food here in china town and the taste is not even close to those in HK. I quite like their roast duck as well as the soup. You can feel that the soup is cooked long and all the flavor already goes inside the soup. The lomein can be a bit too wet but generally a go to restaurant for lunch:) I'm not even going to kid myself, I was really really really wasted and starving to death when I came in here a few weeks ago, thanks to Jonathan T.'s suggestion! Hidden in the middle of chinatown and kind of on the verge of being near all the courthouses, this gem serves up cheap chinese food that tastes homemade out of someone's kitchen and with plenty of noodles. I had the roast duck in noodle soup for only $5.25. Deal of the century because they give you what looks like half of a roasted duck in the middle of your bowl of soup. Everything else my friends ordered looked great, I just wish I remembered what it was. Place is fairly spacious with round tables spread out and seemed pretty clean. Extra bonus points - They are open until 4am! I'm sure I've been here before but it had to have been years ago. I stopped by a few days ago mainly because it was across the street from the M103 bus that I needed to take uptown. I was also hungry and it was chilly out so..wonton noodle soup!The order took about 7 minutes to prepare and cost $5.50. I caught the bus. I did not end up eating until about 35 minutes later but the noodles held their own and still had a nice chew. The wontons really stole the show though. There were four big ones and it was all shrimp. Each bite was so light and fresh! How does the shrimp stay so bouncy and light sitting in soup for so long? I wanted more.I'll be sure to return. You know this place is great when you walk into the tiny old space and it's packed with locals, tourists and cops. The food here is fast, cheap and good. Majority of times I've come here it's just to take out, but they do have tables if you want to sit and eat from the expanded menu. They offer most of what us white people would expect from their Chinese restaurants, but I'd recommend trying something new. I love Chasu Fan (roast pork over rice), just a real comfort food for me, and they do it pretty well here. Not as good as it use to be. I usually order Cha siew (roast pork) with Lai fun but it's not the same. The roasted pork was not flavorful and the noodles were more on the hard side. Soup base was good but overall, it was not a good experience. Ordering was super fast though ! Cash only establishment...This is a 3.5 star rating. Since Yelp does not give partial star, I rounded up to the nearest star.This place is located conveniently off of Canal Street. I understand that many shops in NYC are cash only establishments, however, they need to fix this.Now that's out of the way, this place is interesting. First off, rather than picking up a menu as you sit at your table, they have their menus underneath a clear glass that is held on the tabletop. That way, they wont need to distribute the menus to each guest / table. This is clever because the menu won't ever get dirty as it is sheltered by the glass tabletop.Food wise, their prices are reasonably priced. Some dishes are very cheap whereas others are priced a bit high. Their BBQ dishes are cheap. I ordered the 2 BBQ dish over rice. It was about $6.75 before tax. You can choose between roast pig, roast pork, roast duck or chicken. You can order a 3 meat BBQ dish for $1 more ($7.75). Unfortunately, they did not have the BBQ meat that I wanted, so we didn't order the dish.Congee - fairly good. Good for 2 people.A popular dish everyone ordered was their pan fried noodles with seafood and veggie. It was about 13 dollar dish. Fairly good. However, they only gave us 2 jumbo shrimps total. They were generous with the squid and scallops though.Overall, this place is best for late night as they open till 4am on weekends. However, given that they only take cash dropped it 1 star. Also, their kitchen area is a bit dirty. But then again, this is New York Chinatown. I'll come back here again for late night eats. However, if I am eating out earlier in the day, I'll go elsewhere. Cantonese style comfort food.  Don't come here for the decor or service. However I was pleased to see traditional Chinese style tables and chairs which are rare in a restaurant at this price range.  But maybe they chose the chairs because they are not very comfortable so the tables will turn quickly.It was not busy so I was pleased that they let me sit at a table even though my daughter had not arrived.She had pan fried noodles with char shiu and I had beef juk with a Chinese donut.Everything was good, but not exceptional.There are numerous servers so there wasn't a waiter who was assigned to our table. One person refilled our tea cups and another person cleared the table, taking my cup right after it was refilled before I could drink. I thought of making a comment but did not bother. I had already paid the bill and definitely over tipped!",https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BAzE7G6WNiUqJqLTRPYSvA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FXxz7StU70tdqhjgkMRclQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7GugPRrA22tsTtXHglKGLA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xTDAlmGqYNJzQhO1ozq1vQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/N9Tk4-kU1HQDZ8ls9_chcQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RyQrhC_Ldss_lPEY-5zuLA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HvDc8b8v_LEPY_yaK9bZVg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_2xWGl1OnGP9u0vbyafkww/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nD-e9nMoOnm1jdxvZDYraA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QfZZumo4aLE_hexsC8yW7w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uILlMjIgrLPXYU9QMUyVlQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-YXJ-GHG-lglQcAQ3CDLWw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Lyk3kTFOcMJMsNM3cjH4tg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pvACaCLrW3COsmGEtfwUVA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/th3P1lVV6nWyKKnh-SZHSg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CQWyEcz5BInDlL6udWtDfA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3JzyGFKSWV7BKM4Nazk1Lw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5lAIZffGBsFySfNeOGJfrQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rGY_GNoVUyOqPY1S9q8V_A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/De_Si6so0G067Cfl8mEUyw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AC4KS8o1oo7_bNzKL7aBRQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/K4XH24mcva1YEtYxM8feoA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Jv4YWGql5_Ui7vEi64vgCg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/i0MMCftdZx08RWowiD8QdQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XTZqC7C3AMFk3kq9azKEXA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zeHfoGwVfKvFyxBX26rnyA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tRwzVo7lWwLVC6oSHHhHdg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3cA7GU4ELS1OqaNf-fftog/258s.jpg,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/hill-and-dale-new-york,hill-and-dale-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Bars,American (New),Breakfast & Brunch,"I've come here for the oysters on a weekday and bar hopping on Saturday. The oysters were fresh and paired well with the drink specials they had for happy hour.  The Saturday night I went bar hopping in the LES, I found this place really packed so try not to go from 11:30-1:30 unless you love crowded bars. Music was pretty good with lots of 90's pop/hip-hop thrown in. Never underestimate the power of a good bottomless brunch. For $40, you get your pick of a gigantic plate of food, a small side, and all of the mimosas and/or Bloody Marys you can drink. I would highly recommend calling beforehand and making a reservation; otherwise, you definitely won't get a booth seat and the bar and couch areas fill up fast, too. At 11:30 on a Sunday morning, we were fortunate enough to squeeze into some bar seating, but it wasn't the most comfortable and we didn't really have enough space on the countertop.The mimosas are STRONG. 3 carafes later, my friend and I were nicely buzzed despite eating a whole plate of food. Totally worth the trip.The food was great, too. We both ordered the Farmer's Breakfast and I got the yogurt parfait as the side. The bacon was a nice, thick and fat strip of meat - some of it was a little overcooked while other parts were perfectly soft. The sausage was excellently flavored. And the grits were chunky, just the way I like 'em.Service is pretty quick and the staff is really friendly, so come on by if you're looking for a place to get your bottomless brunch fix. Solid place. Cute rustic decor. Booths for food service. Fun dance floor. Average priced NYC drinks ($14 cocktails). I enjoyed the ""Flip the Frog"" gin cocktail. Friendly bartenders who kept their cool and were kind, despite the constantly crowded bar. Option for party reservations in an XL booth, which was intimate and surprisingly spacious. The place was fully packed around 11 on Saturday night, but it significantly cleared out around 12:30/1am, probably with all the suburbanites rushing to catch trains back to the Island/NJ. I'd come back. Good cocktails, good music, and good crowd. They also have a room with couches inside. My friend booked it before for her 30's bday party, and it was pretty decent. They also have booth area and high tables as well. There's dance floor near the bar. The only downside about this bar was they only have two bathrooms and there was always a huge line... but other than that, I enjoyed my time here. Came here for my cousin's birthday. She reserved the small couch area in the front. She had a lot of people and it was really tight, I wish they had removed the table from that area so that we could've had a little more space. All of her guests were buying drinks at the bar. There was more space in the back but because it was so crowded it was body on body wall to wall. The negative to this place is the single bathroom for men and women. I waited until I got home before I got on that line. Otherwise the music was good it was a chill place to hang out and meet people. Everyone at her party had a good time. Not sure about how the prices were because I didn't purchase any drinks. A friend of mine offered to treat me to dinner and drinks, and Hill and Dale was their venue of choice. I wish I could give this restaurant 4-and-a-half stars, because it ranks pretty highly among my dining/drinking experiences, even if it does not quite hit the 5-star mark. It's definitely high on my list of places to return to!The interior is lovely - spacious, to say the least. There are tables, a bar with a decent amount of seating, and a lounge area with sofas and chairs. It's very tastefully designed, and the dim lighting sets a calm, relaxed atmosphere. I had trouble choosing what to eat, because a lot of things on the menu caught my eye. I settled for chicken fingers, while my friend chose the wings. As soon as I smelled the wings, my mouth began to water - I just might have to try them next time!In keeping with my native Buffalonian ways, I ordered my fingers with a side of Buffalo sauce, in addition to the sweet mustard and Chipotle mayo that come as a standard. The Buffalo sauce was great - it was closer to an authentic Buffalo flavor than I think can be found at most places in NYC. However, I also loved the other 2 dipping sauces - each one tangy and unique in its own right. The tenders were cooked perfectly - crispy on the outside, but moist on the inside.The bartender was very friendly and knowledgeable on the menu items! She was happy to provide my additional side of Buffalo sauce, along with the 2 sauces the tenders come with - something you wouldn't think tends to be an issue at restaurants, but has been for me in the past (though I'm always happy to pay an upcharge if that's the policy). As far as a portion-to-price ratio goes, no complaints here.The biggest recommendation for improvement I would make is to have more wines available, although this isn't a deal-breaker for me. I'm glad I came here! Hill and Dale is also one of my all time favorite place. I love coming here because the bartenders are extremely friendly (especially Winnie). What I love most about Hill and Dale isn't just their drinks (Summer Fling &amp; Floozy *screams*), but their food... Their food is what really gets me.You MUST try their mac &amp; cheese, devil eggs with pork belly, oysters, and their artichoke dip--absolutely amazing. I am a person who loves extremely cheesey food. Think CHEESE and Hill and Dale definitely delivers on that.If you want a nice bar to come to where it isn't that crazy, come here on weekdays! It's always great on those days. It gets crazy on Thursday and Friday (definitely Friday because, Friyay). They also do Victorian Burlesque on Thursdays (or was it Tuesdays? Pretty sure it's Thursday but please call them and ask) if you are interested. As for weekends, it is packed for brunch!p.s.-$1 oysters for happy hour, how could you hate this place? Nope. I made a birthday party reservations with Hill and Dale's private dining manager Aya.When we arrived our party was divided into two diff booths. When we asked for a bigger table to seat the whole party the MANAGER, Ryan, came over to our table full of aggression and what he called ""sarcasm"". We politely said we would like to all sit together since it was a celebration. He told us he didnt have other tables for us. Then he asked me if I was ""lying about the reservation"". Yes, he was the manager. Then he tells us, ""you are not going to be happy until i kick the other big group out and seat u guys."" We never asked to move or kick anybody out. After my friend mentioned that his comment and attitude were completely uncalled for and made all of us feel uncomfortable andHe ended up shoving us into a tight table in the back. We all had to squeeze. ""You guys have to end by 9:30."" Omg. Can we just start our bday party?  I was very very disappointed by the service. I was embarrassed and called a liar. Such a joke. We are the paying customer and the manager treated us like we were a pest. We wont be coming back.But the Floozy was good Bottomless Brunch - MUST TRY!  We will be back!First of all, our waiter Joey was fantastic!  He was so friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  I ordered based on his health-conscious SUPER THOUGHTFUL recommendation and ended up getting baked eggs (just whites, no cheese) and a side of fruit.Okay, now let's talk ambiance.  Intimate dark leather booths with wood-paneled walls and ornate wallpaper (see photos). The lighting is dim with various vintage fixtures.  All around the restaurant, antique radios and record players are on display.  You MUST go here!  I highly recommend making a reservation for the bottomless brunch.  You can choose between mimosa or bloody mary.  They also let you switch if you want to.  The service is excellent and it makes for a great IG backdrop! Trashy bar with trashy clientele. I wouldn't bother going here. Plenty of nicer bars in the LES to be honest. All nasty b and t people and the staff are rude too. Save your time and go down the road to Antler or Marshall Stack where the service is real. Don't be fooled by the fake accelerated reviews like we were I'm really neutral about this place. Really nice decor and vibe but not so great music and DJ. He seemed really nice at first and was taking requests -- but then never played them. Why not just say you're not taking requests? Who doesn't play ""Hey Ya!"" when requested??!?! Mad man. Anyway, they've got nice cocktails and dim lighting. So it's a good place for a first date or smaller groups. Where do I start? Upon entering I was a bit confused because no one was in front greeting guest. No host and all the servers and cooks overlooked me. So I walk to the back/bar approached the bar tender who turned out to the manager Ryan. I politely asked if I should wait to be seated or if i should seat myself. His only response was ""No"" . Very confused, I took a seat at the bar and waited for someone to at least offer some service, about 5 minutes pass and nothing so i walk to the front, ironically the actual bartender walks in, I question about being seated she asked how big my party was and suggested we sit at the bar. At the bar i let her know the rest of my party will be arriving a little late. To keep it short and simple up until the point where my guest arrived the bartender gave me horrible service and was pretty unresponsive with my inquiries about the menu. 15 minutes later my guest shows up and the bartenders attitude lifts just a bit. We ate and without even asking she gives us the bill, that's fine we pay and she comes back and questions us about the tip amount. I let her know our tip is representative of your service. She grinned and said ok, now guess what i have an extra $30 charge on my account. Idk if they thought i wouldn't neck or wouldn't care but I'm did and now they have to deal with the rep of having a dishonest bartender. I would not revisit here or even try it to begin with. Don't let these reviews from their friend fool you. I had my 33rd here - yeah it is hard for me to even recognize that I am that age. I could not have had a better experience. I e-mailed about a month in advance to reserve a space, and Aya could not have made it easier. It didn't cost me anything to get a space for 10 reserved on a Thursday (I have no idea if there is a fee Friday or Saturday, but I could understand if there was. Hung out for the first hour at the bar with Winnie, who is a goddamn hero, good for a laugh and good with the pour for a whiskey shot. She'll make anyone have a good night! We had table service throughout the night and the happy hour on weekdays go to 8 pm. LOTS of drinks on happy hour and great food specials as well. Any draft pint $5, well cocktails and select wines $6, as well as daily bartender specials. I guzzled down the bubbly rose (It was April and hell summer is right around the corner), and at $6 a glass, it was a steal. If you're looking to have a birthday party I can't recommend them enough, the bar seems small from the front but it opens up into a big and beautiful space, with plenty of seating for large groups. Not far from the FMBD, easy access to the rest of the City and BK. I'll be back again for sure! I will never come back here. My friend Called a week ahead and reserved a table with Aya for my Birthday. The hostess confirmed we would have the large booth in the front of the restaurant that would accommodate our party of 10. We arrived last night and placed at 2 separate back to back tables. The MANAGER, Ryan, came over and We politely said we would like to all sit together since it was my birthday. He threw his hostess under the bus and said ""she must have messed up. We can't put you all together at the front booth. So, either my hostess was misinformed or you're LYING!"" He flat out accused us of lying. After my friend mentioned that his comment and attitude were completely uncalled for. It made all of us feel uncomfortable and unwelcome, Ryan, the manager, had a nasty reply: ""it's sarcasm. What do you want me to do? You wont be happy until I move you to the front booth."" We never asked to be moved to the front booth (which was being occupied). We just wanted to sit together. He ended up shoving us into a tight table in the back. We all had to squeeze. There weren't enough stools &amp; he gave us a time limit. He told us we Needed to be out in 90minutes. All of this because his hostess didn't book our party properly and gave us wrong information and false promises. This place has a snotty attitude for basically being an immediate post college bar in the lower east side. We were was embarrassed and called liars. Save yourself the hassle and go across the street to Grey Lady. Your establishment physically threw innocent female bystanders who had drinks thrown at them out of their bar.  Shame on you for not getting to the bottom of the situation and just throwing the easier targets (women of color) out of the bar. Be sure that we will never visit this bridge and tunnel establishment again. Love this place!After actively searching for an appropriate bar to celebrate my birthday, a friend suggested Hill &amp; Dale. It had everything I was looking for: unpretentious vibes, fairly priced drinks, and good music. When I got there at 9pm, the place was already bumping. I drank a fair share of the floozy which was DELISH and adorably adorned with a daisy. The music was on point. Everyone in my group commented on what a great bar it was. There was a good ebb and flow to the crowd so it never felt like it was impossibly stuffed. I did email them a few weeks in advance to try and reserve the couches in the back, but they were booked. They were super nice and tried to find me alternative options, but I decided just to wing it and I'm super happy I did! They offer great party packages as well. Highly recommend! Awesome vibes! Tried this because of the reviews and was not disappointed. Great ambiance and bottomless brunch is worth it- strong mimosas, good music. They were slammed that day and our food was cold- waiter took back right away and gave us our drinks on the house. Must go for Sunday funday! The service, the food, the people of Hill &amp; Dale are amazing.I love their pancakes and the maple syrup they have, it's the perfect balance during Boozy Brunch. They have a projector in the back where you get to play Mario Kart with your friends during Brunch, how much better can this place get? I say expand the menu. AMAZING DJ on the weekends with a relaxed, casual atmosphere and plenty of seating ranging from booths to lounge areas.  A great venue for gatherings and birthday drinks.  The only challenge is that there is only 1 bathroom so that can present some very long lines. Totally recommend Came here few times! Love their happy hour! Food and drinks are on point. Great for groups",https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/s7givrVJBWAYxMInXImCag/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4mZhn_6z6OLYqjeujHgoxQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cYC35skE9i1V2gaRGiQpeg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HwNUql9bRFgJ-3BWJyCBKQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OA3VLizbP9s-YBHpTzeqBw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_RT4aPZExINnDsz62gL8cw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CYD-t4Bi-LB7raJA6YNDmg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Tbkndp-9Qmfmm4ioEUuNFg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/sb75zkH7wMBz-A73JMBXdw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/q01E06BrTqgkJpyBpHXTmA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FVqwuZBRFlmbb0tG659zCw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MSgCROUNfYXBbzAvINhbvA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_6BXDZ3rMAuiH4lkFWIF6A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9eTltt4R9zhJewwZqBp8pQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/R6INtF-j4nPns0f5oFBWZw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ASu6ZJimOeb8PIGQLwpd0Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UyQsA0fNxxWVpb7Q3grOeg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gm3Wja_7M6SfRgj9f4gWnw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_kHf7FDZfA5v6Rx6kQUOpg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xTzwf5Vn8Uypq195mMLulw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HJaDOubMTkrWgKbKXkHcCQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wODVvQv_f8MzUIC-MJGtRg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hss8DVHeuadGXlzgvMmzNg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HPZDEDHpRpDEZ8kcrVs4DQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/iOBgpGTBmRwgceITPe3lmg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KjJRVM_xzg2PqpB7DZ_A_Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GltRQtXyUoATroxd-nb6qg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/d9VfWc058T0Zv4Hkn7UeIQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FxwYmzMRZdybROV-PlE_Nw/258s.jpg,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/hometown-hotpot-and-bbq-new-york-2,hometown-hotpot-and-bbq-new-york-2,New York,10002,NY,Hot Pot,Barbeque,NA,"Came here for a birthday dinner and we had a great time! The menu was a little overwhelming, but since it was a big group of us, we decided to stick to just hotpot (the other option was just Korean bbq, or a combo of both). Everyone had their own pot which was great, because it meant we could all choose what broth we wanted (personally I don't like spicy but almost everyone else did, so I'm glad to have been able to choose individually). We tried to not go too crazy with ordering (someone said that while it is unlimited, you get charged for whatever you leave behind - makes sense but not sure how strict they are about it or whether or not that's true), so we stuck to a few basic meats and then a ton of veggies that always taste amazing in hot pot! The service itself wasn't great - understandably we required less attention since we were just cooking everything ourselves, but when we wanted to order more of stuff or even just get more water, it was a little stressful to get someone's attention. However, it was also a friday night and super busy.The other thing that was annoying was the line for sauces - it would be nice to have the option to either just pick some and have them brought to the table (maybe in some type of squirt jar so that whatever you don't use isn't wasted) and only going up to the sauce bar if you wanted to see them all. Especially with the 2 hour limit, having something take 15+ minutes was frustrating!Things to note before going - birthday girls or guys get free dinner within three days of your birthday and if you bring a cake, which we took advantage of. Next, we brought boxed wine because despite there being a $15 uncorking fee (it's BYO but it looked like you could also order if you wanted, not sure about this but I saw a ton of beer bottles that were all the same), which is pretty low, we figured we'd save a little more and only ""uncork"" one white and one red for our group. Last thing that we didn't like was that the shrimp came with shells, tails and heads and getting all that off yourself isn't the most enjoyable thing, especially at a dinner table. Would have been nice to have the option of clean or whole!There was, as listed on the menu, a 2 hour limit to seating/drinking, however we were definitely not rushed out. It might have been because we had dinner towards the end of the night, or because we had a bigger table that another big group wasn't waiting on, but it was nice to not feel rushed out. Overall we had a great time and would definitely come back! I use to come here literally all the time when they first opened. Food is always super fresh and service was always amazing until my recent visit (-1 star for the most recent visit).It took about 40-45 minutes before we were seated. Prior to that, both the hostess completely ignored us even though we were standing right in front trying to get their attention. Finally someone acknowledged us and told us it'll be a 40 minute wait. Be prepare to wait longer so go take a walk around Little Italy. They do give a call once your table is ready so don't worry!The service was extremely slow! It was a full house in the basement level but there were many waiters. We received menus immediately but took about 15 minutes before we were able to call a waiter over to take our drinks order. On top of that, the music was way too loud that our server didn't seem to hear us when ordering and I had to scream it to him a few times. He definitely could not hear over the loud music because I received a few wrong items and a few items were missed.Moving on to the food!You have a choice of hot pot(24.99?), BBQ or both(31.99 I believe). We went with the hot pot option. You can choose personal pots or duo/trio pots. Many soup options to choose from! Highly recommend the curry flavor or herbal soup. You'll get the options of the usual hot pot items. Highly recommend fatty beef, different kinds of fish balls and fish tofu, udon and lastly veg. Sauce stations are on both floors so don't be a dummy and walk upstairs when you're seated in the basement floor! There's man options to choose from so play around with it! My new current favorite is the bbq hoisin but I do love a good mix of peanut sauce, regular hoisin, scallions, cilantro, garlic and sesame oil. Don't forget the hot sauce!Notes:- Reservations minimum of 7 people.- Don't forget the dessert at the end! Black rice sweet soup and taro sago!- Check in for ice cream. One check in for the entire table (4 people = 4 ice cream!) Vanilla, chocolate or green tea.- Limit of 2 hours.- Credit cards accepted.- Order what you can eat and continue to order throughout your meal. Not all at once in case you have too much leftover I loooove them here.I took them up on their birthday offer two years ago (free dinner for the birthday guy/gal within three days of your birthday and if you bring a cake). I was more into pie than cake at that time, and they okayed us bringing a pie in lieu of a cake (which they do keep cold for you). We also had a party larger than 6 people, so we were able to make reservations. It was a fun, fun time.I went again yesterday (why it took so long for me to go back there, I have no idea). And they are still just as awesome (actually, even more awesome). Apparently in all the hubbub of my previous visit, I totally missed out on the amazing artwork (that are copies of street art found in Malaysia). Not just the big one of the kids on the bike you see when you enter the restaurant, but in more hidden areas as well.The space is huge (there's a downstairs area further back), with two stations for your sauce mix and dessert. And it's AYCE for hot pot or BBQ or BOTH. How can you go wrong?!Admittedly. Admittedly. The quality isn't the highest. But if you expect high quality from an AYCE place then you'd have to be willing to shell out major, major dough. But the price point is great here (you pay more if you don't finish what you order, friends). The only thing I think they are missing are tomatoes for their hotpot, but I can live.I love that their tables include both the larger burner or the smaller ones if you want to go individual. I love how quick they are with bringing out the noms. And I love the people. The hostess in charge (boss lady?) was very sweet when I told her I was early, but two of my friends were coming (they only seat entire parties). The server who took our order was very nice, all the runners who brought or food/refilled our soup/refilled our water were also great, and then when I was eating, I knocked my water glass over and it shattered all over the place, and they were really nice about it.Also, I LOVE their desserts. There's the coconut xi mi lu (taro, yam, coconut, tapioca) and the red bean &amp; black glutinous rice with coconut milk. Two of my favorite desserts. They are lacking in the amount of tapioca and black rice, respectively. But WHO CARES?! THEY ACTUALLY HAVE THAT! Awesome.Love them. Love this place. Would be happy to celebrate many, many birthdays here. They don't take reservation unless you come with a party of six or more so expect to wait especially on a very cold winter day. Luckily, we came here with a party of six and they do require that everyone shows up before being seated. If you can't wait and want to be seated right away, then they will start docking your 2 hour time limit once the table is set up. Their food is definitely fresh and delicious. Though not everything is available even though it's listed on the menu. They claim it's because they ran out. Hmmm...quite interesting to run out of crab when arrived around 6:30pm. Dunno, but this seems too convenience. Either case, if you're into hotpot and something that's healthy and interactive, then Hometown is one spot to check out. Though do expect a very long wait and excruciating wait. Their price is reasonable, for Manhattan rent and their food service is excellent. Great place for hot pot/kbbq. We did both and both were fantastic. The selections on the menu was decent and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves here! **TIP**They have a 2 hour eating limit as do most all you can eat hot pot places and bbqs and any food wasted will have an extra charge. There's not overly strict with the food waste, but you have to use your best judgement. Also if you come for your birthday it's a free entry meal, of course with proof of birth (License). **Atmosphere**Very airy place. I definitely enjoyed that because the last place I went for hot pot, it was very hot and we went during the winter time! So I definitely appreciate the air circulation and how open the restaurant is. **Food**Everything that was brought out was fresh. You also have the option of ordering a large version of the item you want or the small so that you don't overdo it on the ordering. **Service**Service was great too. The servers were all very attentive and they all seemed to work together. **Comparison**Hometown and 99 Favor are both relatively similar in terms of service and food. I think Hometown has a more modern feel to the place and the place has more open space which is good when everyone wants to do hot pot, so it allows for more breathing room. I think either or, you can't do wrong. Hometown seems to have more english speaking servers versus 99 favors where I had to have a friend do a lot of the translating. A friend recommended this place so as a hotpot professional i decided to give it a try. We ordered hotpot with 3 broth (tomato spicy and normal soup). Broth is not tasteful meaning the spicy section is not spicy at all. Menu has very limited selections of veggies and meat. And the dipping sauce section is ok, pretty standard.Good thing about this place is that its pretty spacious and has big tables. Its also clean and the waiters are good. Its just the food that lacks. hot pot on a freezing night in NY? YES PLEASE! we put our name and number down and it was about an hour wait which was perfect because we walked over to an ice cream spot for some pre-dinner dessert and you know, get a lil colder! hahaonce we were seated, we ordered damn near everything on the menu! i got the tom yum broth and it was so flavorful! all the meats and seafood tasted fresh so did all of the veggies. the sauce bar tho! they have everything you need to make your sauce! minced garlic, green onions, sesame seeds, sesame oil, chili paste, chili oil, wasabi and some yummy house sauces. enjoyed every bite! Tip of the day: You can call in to claim your spot in line as there's usually an hour wait.I got the AYCE Hot Pot ($24). It was an immense amount of food and I'm glad they had pre-made sauces as I'm the worst at creating my sauces now for some reason. All the meats and veggies were good, but I agree with the others that the blue crab quality was subpar. In addition, the table is really long so you pretty much have to shout in order to have a conversation.Even after being extremely full and not able to finish what we had left, I got the red bean soup dessert, which was really good. They have a coconut soup dessert with mochi/other beans as well.Meal Value (from 1-10, my measure of quantity/quality of the meal compared to price): 8Pretty standard AYCE Hot Pot value, but from all the sauces to fresh veggies and good meats, I give this place better value than usual. Oh what an adorable place. This place is pretty huge I have to say. Seating everywhere and they even have a downstairs. Which is where the bathroom is FYI. We came in right before several other groups came in. We got all you can eat hot pot and bbq. $32? A person for that. Oh em gee. Get the beef with black pepper sauce for the bbq. You won't regret it! I liked how they had chicken satay and even beef satay for bbq. They love their peanut sauce, I mean look at their sauce bar. I liked the variety for hot pot meats and such. They didn't have a lot of green leafs options which is fine as I didn't care for them anyways. They had an okay selection for vegetarian things I believe. I just remembered a bunch of veggies and tofus stuffed with fish paste. More for Pesci pollo vegetarians. Overall the selections were okay. Nothing crazy. The beef melted in my mouth for the hot pot. It was delicious. I was scared it was going to be chewy. The lamb for the Hotpot was okay. Not melt in your mouth but it's decent. It's a little bit gamy. You can definitely tell it was lamb. They had a good variety for hot pot broth. Like 6-8 ish? I think I came to the fact that I'm not huge on Szechuan peppers. Not really because of the numbing part but because it gives off a floral taste and it makes me gag a bit to be honest. Well from a past experience. It's not terrible here. The broth was good. Not really florally until you bite into a peppercorn which I did by mistake. The curry broth was very curry. It was my favorite of the bunch. Super coconuty and strong flavor. Kimchi, well my friend chose that. Was okay with it but I did like to eat the cabbage itself that was in it. I wonder what Tom yum taste like. When it came to the stuff coming out. I got majority of what I asked for except one meat on the first round. But got it on the second round. Other than that, got everything I wanted. The staff wasn't very interactive with you. They just did their thing then left. Which is whatever I guess. He brought out what I wanted so I'm not complaining. There is complimentary dessert at the sauce bar. Two kinds: a taro and sweet potatoes type of soup and a red bean one. They're both served warm/hot and I loved the taro one. From being full, I ate two bowls of it and a bowl of red bean. I would like to try other places as well for all you can eat. I am not a AYCE fan but this place exceeded my expectations.  I meet up with a bunch of friends who wanted hot pot in Chinatown.  Since I normally only go to Flushing, I used Yelp to help me find this place.We went in 6:30 on a Friday night, the hostess told us the wait was 2 hours.  Our party of 5 was seated in about an hour.  $23.99 for hot pot, 27.99 for BBQ and 31.99 for both is reasonable for AYCE in the city.  Best part is they offer individual pots on induction cook tops.The waiter came and took our orders and the food came out pretty quick.  The sauce bar was re-stocked frequently and was pretty clean for such a crowded place.  Next to the sauce bar, they also offered sweet soup desserts (red bean soup with coconut milk or sweet potato with tapioca and coconut milk).  The food was fresh and presented well.  I got the spicy ma la broth and boy it was spicy.  The large amount of szechuan  peppers left my tongue slighty numb..lol.  The wait staff was quick to clean up and also was readily available for re-orders.  Overall this place server really fresh and good food for a very reasonable price.  Only con is the long wait since they don't take reservations. We arrived at 5:30 on Christmas day for hot pot and BBQ. They indicated it will be an 1.5 hour wait. Since it was 35 degrees outside, we decided, let's wait. It is $32 for both hotpot and bbq, so we decided to do both to get an idea on the quality on both offerings. The place is much bigger than you think because they also have a downstairs area. It is super clean and the ventilation is good. It's important when the place serves hotpot and bbq. The menu is huge and has pictures for each item. This is important when you're not familiar with hotpot and can see what you are getting.The positives is that the hotpot was more successful. The seafood was very fresh. Loved the stuffed items that are special to them, especially the jalapeno stuffed with fish paste. The soup bases were all really good too, curry, kimchi and tom yum. The sauce bar has a ton of options. Much more options than most and the quality is very good. The beef was really good, but I think we need a better balance of fat and meat. It was almost like beef belly, but it was very tender and delicious.The not so good is the lamb and bbq items. The lamb was so thickly sliced and lean that after cooking, it was quite tough. The bbq short ribs and jerky we ordered were way too sweet. I've never had fresh raw jerky prepared right on the grill before, so it was quite a novelty. The style is like the Malaysian jerky. The nice thing about the bbq is that the servers cook for you.Overall, I feel that we have better hotpot places with higher quality of meats in SF and SF Bay Area. This is my go to hotpot place if I'm in Chinatown and craving hotpot. But they're always so busy and packed, lunch time is less busy than dinner. I've been here many times and there were once or twice when I waited over an hour for dinner but it was worth it. There's something I really like about hometown, not just the food. Service isn't bad either. I really liked how clean and bright it seems whereas other hotpot places give off a dimmed and dirty feel. I also like the high ceiling making the space seem bigger than it already is. There's an upper and lower level. They're pretty quick with bringing the broth base and food out usually. I really really love their dessert, well one of them. The purple rice sweet soup? I always leave space for 2-3 bowls of that at the end! Even if I'm already full, I still go for 2-3 bowls. You know what that says. The dessert is hot like it should be not warm or almost cold. There is one weird thing though, I don't like how the pot locations are arranged on the tables and the tables are really wide and far from opposite sides. So it gets hard to speak to friends or hard to hear them. Other than that, I would keep coming back. This is one of my favourite AYCE restaurants. We had the hotpot and bbq combo. The food is good and clean. The service is even better. The stuffs are very nice. They have a wide range of sauces. Highly recommend. The wait isn't long. They are less busy comparing to other hotpot places in Asian communities. You get free ice cream if you checked in on Yelp upon existing. A good variety of sauces to choose from. They didn't have crabs and clams that night. These two are my favorite when it come to hotpot. However, missing crabs and clams didn't bother me much. What really bothered me that night was the service. The wait staff didn't know take the initiative to check on our table or refill our soup nor the plates. The place is severely lacking management IMO. It was also hard to catch the wait staff's attention even when they weren't busy. Hotpot is such a joyful type of meal. I usually enjoy hotpot very much wherever I go. Hometown's service really disappointed me. Best hot pot experience I've had in the states. It all starts when you walk by the walls painted with quaint artwork, past the tables of friends stuffing their faces and chatting the night away, into the back area where it opens up into multiple levels.So many meats/veggies/dumplings/everything. Naturally, I got the all you can eat hot pot. The menu is so amazing and so overwhelming - SO MANY OPTIONS. You tell your waiter what you want and they'll bring it to you. And don't worry too much about if you order too much because the more types of things you order, the smaller each portion. In other words, get a wide variety so you can try a lot!So many soups/sauces. You can get up to 3 varieties of soup for your hot pot. We went with the classic, spicy, and tom yum (all great). As for dipping sauces...there must've been about 50 varieties (and yes, it's serve yourself so you can mix and match as many as you want).TL;DR: great atmosphere, epic variety of everything, definitely coming back. Solid 3.5 stars. Sauce galore! Now, I love hot pot no matter if it's a hot or cold day. Now this place elicits mixed feelings from me because though they had great service, offered an abundant sauce selection, and even the option of doing 3 soups, they quality and taste just fell short. Now for $23.99/ person you can get all you can eat hot pot. If you go for just hot pot, the meat selection is very limited.  The AYCE BBQ is $27.99 which has a much larger meat selection. However, if you can't decide then go for both hot pot and bbq which is $31.99/ person. Since I just had KBBQ the night before we decided on just getting the AYCE hot pot. The meat selection was not as abundant as I'm used to for AYCE hot pots, but I wanted to give it a try. Normally, I enjoy a little marbling in my beef, but this place just had too much in their cuts. Maybe that was an atypical experience, but for AYCE it wasn't bad. The veggies were fresh and had all the veggies I really like including A-coy, bok choi, and tong ho. Overall, it was a satisfying hot pot meal, but not a meal I would wait for an hour for. Thankfully, we came during off hours and were promptly seated :) Honestly, I prefer 99 over hometown any day after the last encounter. Hometown meat is supposedly better quality than 99 favor but overall, I think 99 has better choices. FYI, if you come during your actual birthday, you need to bring ID and it's a free meal. If you come 3 days before or after, you need to show ID and a cake. If not, no free meal for you! Hometown Hotpot opened a few years ago but I had never gotten around to trying it. I kept going to 99 Favors. That is until I found out Hometown also has the free birthday dinner, so I decided to come here on my birthday. My boyfriend and I came in at around 7 pm on a Tuesday and it wasn't too packed. We were seated immediately. The birthday special works the same way as the one at 99 Favors. If you come on the day of your birthday, your meal is comped. If you come within the week, you have to bring a cake and then your meal will be comped. I opted for both the hot pot and the BBQ.For hot pot, the quality is pretty much the same as 99 Favors except Hometown seems to have fewer selections. Still, they had a good variety. BBQ was so much better than 99 Favors. At 99, they use the same damn marinade for every single dish, so after a while, it feels like you're eating the same thing. Here, they use different marinades, and they cook it for you. The quality of the meats also seem slightly better than its competitor.Sauce station was great! It's clean and compact, yet it has all the sauces you'd want - including a few of their 'Hometown special sauces'. I'm not quite sure what was in these sauces but we both really liked them.Service was very good. If you started looking at the menu again, someone would immediately come over. This did get a little annoying at one point but I would definitely rather this than not being able to find a waiter to order. Food comes out very quickly so it's best to order a little at a time, and not eat with your eyes.Finally, Hometown feels cleaner than 99 Favors probably since it's newer. But overall, I liked Hometown a lot better. I'll be coming here from now on whenever I need my hot pot fix. $32 for all you can eat hotpot and kbbq??? Free meal on your birthday??? Hometown is a dream come true. We came for a late dinner on a Thursday night and we're in meat heaven. Two hours of grilling, steaming, and Asian sauce combo testing. All the beef/steak options are well seasoned and tender and we ordered plate after plate. The chicken options are good but not as great and given limited stomach space, I'd opt for something else. The hotpot options are diverse as well but avoid the noodles and the veggies early on or else you can easily run out of appetite! Great seafood choices like fish balls, giant shrimp, and crab legs as well. The price is right, the quality is fresh, and if you optimize your selection you will have a surprisingly affordable feast. Con: This place does not take reservations, so we waited exactly 1.5 hours for dinner on a Sunday night. It's fine to wait on a freezing winter night, but idk how I'd feel about that in the summer....Pro: They gave us little treats while we waited in line-the mink creme brle that was really good, but it didn't came back around a second time :(Meal: Nice concept. Tried the hotpot, where each person cooks their own bowl. I got the kimchi soup base, which was actually spicier than the curry base! When you order beef, one order is 5 slices, so make sure you get at least 10 orders for a table of 4. We realized this later in the evening and was so full after  ~15 orders. Everything else is your standard hotpot ingredients - mushroom, fish ball, tripe, chicken, fried tofu, watercress, corn, etc. Honestly I didn't think there'd be enough food but we had more than enough after ordering the above.I can't stress how cool their concept is for hotpot-aside from the DIY you also get to mix your own sauces at a buffet-style counter and the tech used here is super chic and modern! Can't wait to try their BBQ next time.",https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/B7p-cZUcJasqgM36BVes-w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/53OPEbf1QD-EGEvezekHBw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GzVAag9aR3EY4U0sT6cHNw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qVAE4thAYzAgSJS19KihrQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_3OZ5ZAfOJOq7irfurY2FQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/01DjnySc-TH2ODZ7_k07BA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hZ3kPwlinvZdGhiViB6FHA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VWjTimH63wl87_7QqPpC3A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XAXnKqsB-u4Gr6xw5FuFLQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PFO3ksnVW_4Lj_VPgN3-6Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KUUzCp4Zn5CLGzySn9VJ1g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KVHEXrCFNO0bsWkZAy0OVg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/E2nrTI8nPUPy5J6AAdKxpQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yJjP4DLxfi8lyndZSBxDjg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TPRpoL5F6hPN4G7kZf-Y8w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AMIya3PjEjDJyD79FpBvvA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kdOIR0AOouLdU7uMPYFaZw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_4f-CZ3BPSJhv1Qo8gfZcw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RqVuvf4nzGS3awK4r7n5QA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZLQFBN0jBRQ2dCY64vZ7tw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0GytnFTu7TukyFpGgXJs7g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0PQOO35xqywn_ik_nwIYxA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MlpJ6xzB1HOQkr4r5WRh0A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Pl77zAIqtjyMIt4ykiKyZA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BoCttp_sxDJPFgdTfcmHBw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CfHa3IYif4zHbhYoaKnJZQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UKQBH-bmZRZtPsjrXJMJRQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SqX67X0-Y-FmgsaeW4YLlQ/258s.jpg,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/hotel-chantelle-new-york,hotel-chantelle-new-york,New York,10002,NY,French,Bars,Breakfast & Brunch,"Note: This review is specifically for BRUNCH!While I reluctantly admit to being a regular at Hotel Chantelle as a nighttime destination during my party girl days while living on the Lower East Side (haven't we all?) I am proud to say I have graduated to being a regular at brunch, and I can't tell you how much I love it. Anyone that knows me well knows that this is one of my favorite go-to's for a consistently solid brunch: the atmosphere is open, airy and gorgeous - and the retractable rooftop means that you get natural lighting and an ""outdoor"" feel, which is something you don't get year round in New York. The service is top notch (insert shameless plug about the lovely hostess Shauna), the delicious select brunch drinks flow seamlessly (at $0.92 each), and there is something on the menu for everyone. Everything I have ordered here from the burger to the burrata to the egg crostini to the lobster caesar has been great, and don't even get me started on their parmesan truffle tots. Typically they have a band for weekend brunch that is always fantastic and really elevates the room's overall environment. The vibe is usually on the dressier side as there are always a good amount of birthday parties or celebrations happening, so while there's no need to go overboard you definitely want to look decent. So come here for your birthday, a girl's day out, with your visiting friends/family from out of town, or if you're like me come for any and no reason at all and enjoy! Yo this place is okay I've been here 3 times now. But the last time I rolled in and was about to buy drinks for my party of 25, however the bouncer asked me to move seats so I asked my group if they wanted to move to the bar next door and we did.  It's a great place however with standards like that you may bring in big spenders but you also lost out on like $500 just from one drink each of this group. Keep doing what you're doing but if you're not a bit nicer I guarantee your bar will be empty by 2020. Good luck guys. My review is strictly for the night scene of this place. I haven't been here during the day, but at night all I can is that the bouncers, staff, and bartenders are EXTREMELY rude and saying this doesn't even do it justice.They must be told by management ""You have to be rude"" because if not they need to clean house or do some serious staff training. There's a difference between being strict and being extremely rude to your paying customers. The bouncers were kicking people out for no reason, the bathroom staff were yelling at people for wanting to go to the bathroom, and the bartender acted like asking for a water after buying 4 shots of tequila was like asking for free alcohol. Good luck if you want to go here at night This place has been my cousin and I favorite summer time to spot for years. Finally today I made it a point to brunch and love love loveeed the dj! So shouts to the DJ. I enjoyed my burger and fries .. I kept it pretty basic with a mimosa, followed by a pitcher of vodka, prosecco and lemon juice shared amongst my cousin, aunt and myself. Wouldn't mind coming back to try dinner here and of course partying. Came here last night to model in a fashion show.  My gentleman friend who came to see me got a bottle ticket from the show organizer where he was told it was $30 for gratuity.  He accepts this and our group (the models, designers, hair/makeup professionals, photographers &amp; the like) partake in 1 bottle of vodka.  I drank less than 1/4 of it in one glass poured for me (since I have next to no alcohol tolerance and my father was an emotionally abusive alcoholic so I don't really drink).When we get ready to pay up (which I was asked to do by my gentleman friend in an unappreciated ambush but that was a conversation amongst ourselves), I receive this.  Being more than 3x the amount we are told is owed, I speak with the event organizer &amp; the designer I was working with (who'd experienced his own grievances there, including 2 VIPs being rejected at the door for lack of ID though I know one of them personally; he doesn't look under 21 &amp; is a celebrity).  During this time, my friend speaks with a guy I presume is the manager who says we can pay the $30 after all.  I say this to the event organizer.When this manager returns, the event organizer gets upset at him &amp; tells me this bill is an ""estimate"" + we can pay what we want, including nothing.  I asked why they couldn't just give us a proper bill listing the 1 bottle we actually had (I couldn't drink 1/4 of a bottle in a sitting &amp; we were both present for the bottle service) &amp; that when you give someone a bill like this, they are going to assume they owe this.  The event organizer is not pleased here, I inform the manager than I'm an attorney (and have been for over 9 years in NY) &amp; that under NY law, you are not required to pay a tip.  I also stated that because he said we could pay nothing, that is exactly what we were paying and I told my friend ""Darling, let's go.""Had we simply gotten a corrected, accurate bill with the $30 quoted price, we'd have been fine.  I feel bad for the bottle service lady but I didn't appreciate this extortion attempt nor any attempt to fix this situation.  Security escorted us out &amp; I left with my head held high having maintained principles.  Don't try messing with a sober lawyer's limited income. Note that this review is only for brunch, and I cannot speak to the club scene that occupies the same space later on. Hotel Chantelle offers a phenomenal brunch downtown. The service is adequate and what you would expect from a bar-turned-brunch restaurant. The setting is great, though, with a covered ceiling when it rains or open when the weather is nice.I ordered the Breakfast Pizzette which was every bit as good as it sounds and came out piping hot. The truffle tater tots are also a must and a great complement to any entree. They were offering two 92 cent cocktails while I was there. The Easy Passage was good but not as good as their seasonal drink, if offered when you are there. Overall the brunch is well-priced and underrated due to the negative reviews for the bar/nightclub. Keep in mind that they will charge you $1 for water (disclosed in small print on the menu)--let your server know that you do not want to pay and they will not charge you for it. Had an great time at Hotel Chantelle for brunch on Saturday!I booked a reservation for 4 a few weeks in advance for 11:30 AM on the rooftop. However, due to personal conflict, we moved our reservation to 12:30 PM. Unfortunately, there was no space on the rooftop - and no cancellations either - so we were seated inside instead.At 12:30 PM, my friends and I were the only people in the entire restaurant to be seated inside. The space inside Hotel Chantelle is honestly very nice - a bit unsettling because it was so empty, but only because everyone else was on the rooftop. A thing to note though: the rooftop doesn't really have a view and is quite a small space, so besides the lack of sun, we didn't really mind being inside. First and foremost, the drinks here are CHEAP and STRONG. You can get a variety of drinks for under a dollar. We ordered pitchers which were $8. At first, they didnt taste too strong - but I ended up getting drunk quite fast, so it's definitely worth it!The food is also phenomenal. I ordered the Egg White Frittata and I customized the order by adding truffle oil. The waitress was very accommodating in tweaking my order. I will say that service was a bit slow. I assume this was because we were the only people inside and most of the waiters/waitresses were concentrating their efforts upstairs. However, once the food came my friends and I were more than pleased with what we ordered. Highly recommend the egg white frittata as well as the Eggs Benedict (They have options for build your own!) and the fries.Overall, I had a wonderful experience and will definitely come here for brunch again. Came here with reservations for my friends birthday at the upstairs bar/dining area. They informed us they couldn't seat us until our entire party arrived but when they did arrive, we still had to wait an additional 30-45 minutes for a table. Pretty disappointing since  these reservations were made weeks in advance and my friend had to put a card down to hold the reservation. To make up for it, however, they gave us our first round of drinks on the house.The food while small and pricey was good. The only dish I clearly remember getting is the Spicy Tuna Avocado Toast which was good but the hardened toast made it hard to eat. I definitely recommend the drinks- I'm not a huge fan of cucumbers but the Libertine was surprisingly good and very refreshing. I was visiting New York and we came here for brunch with a group of four people. As soon as we got upstairs I could already tell this place was going to be adorable. It's decorated nicely and is the coolest little rooftop restaurant/bar spot. There's also a cute private room off to the side (perfect for parties) that's totally secluded from the rest of the place. We had to wait about 30 minutes before getting seated so we decided to go sit by the bar. The bar area is really clean and open and we were right by the live band (which was awesome).I ordered the crab cakes and my fianc ordered the chicken and waffles. The crab cakes were absolutely amazing and hands down one of my favorite crab cakes I've ever eaten. I love seafood and these crab cakes were delicious. They were lightly fried so it wasn't overwhelming and they came with an aioli on it that was the perfect compliment. There was also a corn chowder and arugula sprinkled on top. It comes with two crab cakes and it's definitely filling. My fianc loved the chicken and waffles. The breading was perfect on the fried chicken and had a little kick to it. The waffles were also really good and the portion size was huge, so it was definitely more than enough food. We also ordered the truffle tater tots. I definitely suggest ordering this for the entire table to share because not only is it a lot, but it's so good. For dessert, we got the bread pudding... This was some of the best bread pudding I've EVER had. It was so soft, warm, and gooey. Simply delicious. It also had Nutella on it, which is always a good idea.The prices are definitely a little higher here but I definitely felt it was worth it considering the presentation and taste of the food. It was great and I hope to come back here the next time we're in NYC! Solid 3 stars for Hotel Chantelle's brunch. Hotel Chantelle offers a fun brunch. While it isn't a bottomless brunch it's still fun and boozy! My personal favorite on the menu is the French toast. It's cornflake encrusted, big, and very rich. I also enjoy the avocado toast to share! In terms of the drinks there are a few options: half priced cocktails, mimosas for around $4, and a couple of 99 can't drinks that I didn't love. I strongly recommend the pineapple jalapeo cocktail drink. I've had it on several occasions. Aside from the food, the ambience is nice but it can get quite crowded with people at the bar so I recommend making reservations. I have only been here before for the clubbing portion of it but yesterday I decided to try the restaurant with a friend. I have to say the food here is actually extremely good. Everything that we tried from the tuna cigars to the fish tacos and the grilled octopus was impeccable. The service was very attentive and everyone was so polite. However, I will say the one thing that actually really bothered me that only happened at the end is that they charge you for tap water. I couldn't believe it when I saw that on our bill there was a $2 charge for premium water. I have NO idea what was premium about it. I feel it's something they do to jack up your bill and it's not right. I had a nice meal and having an argument would have ruined my mood so I just left.. but I posted a picture on yelp of my receipt. Such a cute brunch place. Love the vibe here. Plus the drinks are so cheap! Good food, good drinks, and good vibes all around. Definitely recommend this place to anyone in New York. If you do plan to come here for a weekend brunch, I highly recommend making a reservation because this place does get packed and full. I first heard about Hotel Chantelle because of a Groupon listing for dinner.Ambiance: The rooftop space is so cute! I have been in the summer and winter, and while it's nice with the closed roof, the openness of the space during the summer is 10x better. There was a live jazz band playing during dinner, and it set the mood for the evening. I wish they always had something like that!Food: Half and half? We had a Groupon for $80 off our bill, so we ordered quite a lot of food. To start, we tried the tuna cigars, chicken n' waffles, and buffalo cauliflower (we wanted the brussel sprouts because they're our favorite menu item but they had run out). Everything was very tasty and I decided my new favorite is the cauliflower - it's crispy but really flavorful because of the buffalo and bleu cheese.For our entrees, my boyfriend ordered the burger and I got the salmon. He loved the burger, but my salmon was just okay. I didn't like that it came with skin on it - I feel that it holds all the ""fishiness"", and I spent most of my time trying to take it off so I could eat my meal.Service: Good - our first server left after taking our order, and his replacement was probably still training. She was sweet but kind of slowPrice: I would not consider dining here without a Groupon. The prices are not reasonable, and even with $80 off our meal, the bill was higher than most restaurants of better quality.Minus: Left with mosquito bites all over my ankles This place is the worst. There is no cell service, bouncers are mean and objectify women, and it's overall a scary place. Will never be back and encourage others not to go. Great venue.3 floors. The rooftop has some nice decor and not loud music. Good food for a dinner.The first floor is a regular bar, but on Fridays, they have a very fun burlesque show.And the basement is a big dance floor with very good music of all genres.I highly recommend that place of you want to dance and have fun.Not very expensive Apologies in advance for the slightly long post, but I want to be thorough when giving a bad review. I can't stress how disappointed I was with this restaurant. I was really looking forward to checking out the Jazz Brunch that I've been hearing about for so long. Let me start with the positives. I like the menu and the special brunch cocktail deals they offer. The rooftop area is pretty big and nicely designed. I enjoyed the food that I ordered. The hostesses were doing a very good job of keeping the situation under control because it's very busy and hectic for brunch on a holiday weekend.Now for the cons. First of all it is way too hot up on the roof, so I would advise you don't go on a day that's too hot/humid. Or you can simply grab a drink by the bar and check out the scene then eat downstairs where there's air conditioning. There are mini fans spread out in the rooftop area, but it didn't help at all. Most people are fanning themselves with the menu to cool themselves down. My main issue with this place was the scam they're running with the 'water service' they charge you for without asking first. I'm not sure if they're still doing this or not, but I went the first week of July. They set up the table and pour the water in all of the glasses before your seated. I didn't think anything of it, I just figured they wanted to get that out of the way instead of waiting until we're seating and asking for it. Low and behold we get the bill and see that there's a charge for $4. We inquire about this charge then the waitress explains that it's for Water service. We're all puzzled by this because we didn't ask for sparkling water or anything. When the waitress comes back we ask why we're being charged for water since it's supposed to be free unless we ask for anything other than tap. She immediately said she'd remove it without answering our question as if it settled the matter. This really turned me off. $4 isn't a lot of money, but it's the way they went about it. It is really poor form and not the best way to encourage repeat service if attempt to nickel and dime or rip off customers.  So overall, I like the concept of this place but there are clearly some areas they need to work on. I wouldn't completely rule out going in the future but it won't be anytime soon. Waited in line for a while - once in the roof top was pretty cool.  There was a burlesque show going on in level 1.  The drinks were overpriced but the bartenders poured heavy.   It wasn't overly pretentious, which was a win for me.   The crowded was very blended in age from mid 20s to 40s.    I didn't try any good - not even sure if they offer food.   But it was a fun rooftop for a warm night. Hotel Chantelle in the Lower East Side offers an exceptional brunch on the weekends. If brunch is your cup of tea, make sure to snag a reservation here as soon as you get a chance.We somehow snuck our way on the reservation list an hour or two before we actually sat down this past Saturday, and we were wowed from start to finish. The beautiful rooftop patio is adorned with greenery, and the natural sunlight peers aesthetically through the cloth canvases above. A duo of jazz musicians serenaded the patio with acoustic melodies, and the bartender kept the cocktails flowing (only $0.92/drink - yes, you read that correctly).Aside from the ambiance, the food isn't bad either. We ordered a few main courses to taste the variety, and each of the dishes were great in their own way. The truffle egg fondue was the champion of the bunch in my opinion, and I would certainly also recommend the Eggs Benedict w/ crab. The staff was a bit off-putting at times, however. The hostess at the front of house wasn't the most courteous to say the least, but thankfully the food, drinks, and setting more than made up for the staff's shortcomings.For rooftop dining, Hotel Chantelle is one of the tops. Come here for their well-known Weekend Brunch to experience great food, solid cocktails, and a wonderfully delightful atmosphere. to begin with it was a brunch for me and my friend we were greeted by the hostess  they were really nice.  #1- Everything was great if you are looking for a heavy brunch try out the waffles and chicken they are pretty known for. #2- Ambiance is beautiful make sure you ask to be away from the live singing group because we couldn't hear each other even though they were great.#3- server was great he was a Spanish dude I'm sad I didn't ask for his  name. #3- bartenders on the first floor are full of energy they're great #4-french toast could've been more filling but you get what you pay for #5- Last but not least this spot is only for teenagers so if you an adult looking forward to this restaurant you should opt out .  Salute to the bartender drinks were pure Ok so this place was one of the spots that i had came to when I was doing restaurant hopping with a friend in Chinatown area and mannnnnnn did we have a blast that day!!!!!!!I will never forget it and this place is one of those places that will forever b engraved in my mind cause it was everything that was relaxing, brunchy, beautiful, simple and delicious!!!!!When u first walk in they check ur ID. Then u walk in and go to ur right which will have a flight of stairs going up and u just climb to the top u too u see the hostess.We were lucky enough to have sat outside without a roof over our hear and the weather that day was not tooooo bad. It wasn't hot, it wasn't cold and it didn't start raining yet. We ordered fairly simple since we were restaurant hopping and eating minimally at each place. Even with its simplicity I was still blown away.We ordered a Easy Passage and a Strawberry Rickey and for me they did not skimp out on the booze. Both were delicious but the Strawberry Rickey was my favorite out of the 2. We also ordered a smoke salmon platter and that was uber delicious too. It had bagel chips with a smoke salmon flower and capers and red onion and cream cheese, cucumber slices and romantic slices.I just really enjoyed the atmosphere is the place and the waiters and waitresses was super attentive. And our waiter always came back to ask if we needed another drink and we did not pass that up. I was really happy that day and was super happy that they didn't force us to leave cause we were there for a while.I can't believe that after all these years of living in NYC I only JUST found this place!!!!I will forever go back to this place and bring ppl there!!!!!",https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VA3Ni-s1fWg1EH_LiuPXNA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zcpgRkEwSTfNtyaN4ONDoQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-jbhuBoWpfw3xd23XR6zoQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3n_RE1XO0xYZ24v8NYeQ8Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pbBrRWjZdAW1D3a-RRfXGg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UZEH33X9me1Ilj3Tbp6RVQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/f1NnCMdJdKU8UWAQC0OZEw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HEd6AYRdFBwmokDRbsrhNw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cxzPQa7iq5foxRDjjqW2zg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SFK7VdEIeng9GYQu6g_NRQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/x3FjhwRQDB5XUwEIIJHCEA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tyRRI_7FLNu0NeC5KH6_mA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7jrF9K_CgzOP4RswIpA69Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/iENcRIvRqtx19ZxH333XuQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/H4Z7AL_Wgrntw_rZX3W3Yw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/eV8HxmrJHMRAIIoP-MKgHg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4Z-fbkPJrgv0ATdUdVTcVg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/V2wR6hr-BF9oGNm-MHUANg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YlM4bebobCvS4FSoYBlrXQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/n8HkCP-V8v3-bbTjl9PfnQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ddqglDJLzS8Mo5BLCiQR1Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ItVfF7EOSPbd2eFQ7Yi5SA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SZtjuw-IBQ74K_D8LEgsFQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tpyONSNRXD4UsQvxupsiow/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BmYq4YX2Viu35yGc4ieAsA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZytEW_wP_d4m-Vt5RenSWg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4yXCAsI93iG7d8erj-te4Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cNGrbpqGz2-FWo3j_eUrkw/258s.jpg,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/jacks-wife-freda-new-york,jacks-wife-freda-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Breakfast & Brunch,Mediterranean,American (New),"I found out about JWF from their cookbook. I found it at the public library and borrowed it. Everything looked so good! I bookmarked this place in hopes for the next time I was in the big apple.Leo and behold, I was in NY in the winter of '18. On my last day there, I ventured out to Soho in the rain to finally give this place a shot. The fact it was raining and it was a Tuesday morning probably deterred people from coming. There was no wait! Woohoo! My sister and I shared the rosewater waffle and the Mediterranean breakfast. I also ordered a side of their duck bacon.The waffle was good. It was topped with yogurt and berries and came with honey syrup. I couldn't really taste the rose though, which I didn't mind since I don't like floral flavors. It definitely had a unique taste but it wasn't rosey to me.The Mediterranean breakfast was a nice change from your usual array of breakfast sides. It came with eggs, avocado, cucumber salad, pita and hummus. It was really delicious and on the lighter side. I could see myself eating this every morning. The duck bacon was great. I love duck, and this bacon had a nice quacky flavor.Oh, and don't forget to ask for their hot sauce! It's green and not that hot. It has a tomatillo/Serrano taste which I loved! I licked it clean.I skipped out on drinks because I was going to get a draft latte from La Colombe after. Regret not trying their cantaloupe juice though...This place did not disappoint! Usually, when I look forward to something, it's pretty underwhelming.I would definitely come back again the next time I'm in New York. Maybe people hyped it up too much.Maybe the wait was too long.Maybe the weather wasnt nice.I had an average experience at Jack's Wife Freda. I got the poached eggs with grilled tomato and haloumi and my friend got the waffle. It was both delicious.I think this is on me that I had a high expectation and the queue, service, and the food just did not meet my expectation.Maybe I should give it another try.. We arrived around 1 pm and there was a very long line trying to put their name down. The hostess was very friendly and told us it would be 1 hour and a half wait. We put our name down and walked around SoHo area, the good  thing about this place is that it is nearby all the shopping areas so even it was a long wait, there are things to do. We came back about an hour later and our name was called. The service here is very good. The food is very mediterranean, it tasted fresh. Will love to go back! Here's a tip: get a group of 6+ and make a reservation for brunch! The line is loooong if you come here during prime time business hours and I don't recommend you wait this long. It's good food-but don't wait an hour plus for it. You're in NYC--and heck if you're waiting outside it's probably a nice day and if it's not then stop waiting--enjoy the city! There are plenty of other places to eat. I got the Grilled Tomato and Halloumi with Avocado and poached eggs. They were delicious but I do wish they served more bread. Not enough for all the halloumi and tomatoes they give you. Also I get the decor aspect of the bread on the side but from a utility standpoint, it's not doing so much for me. But another tip, with this dish standing at $14 you can get your budget friendly version at Cafe Mogador in the East Village, which serves the same for $10 (I was just craving this one today so caved in on the higher price)The cappuccino is good - yes they have almond milk- left me shaky which means you know it's got the caffeine overload Atmosphere wise- as a group of six you're crammed into the center at a picnic-style table.  I was rubbing up against my neighbor my entire meal, so it's not the best place to go if you like your personal space. You won't get any. That being said the waiters are attentive and plenty and will guarantee you that you'll be out of there in a jiffy. Probably trying to avoid a riot from taking place outside. Cute spot with a trendy concept. There is always a line out the door. All of the staff dress ""hipster""; wearing beanies, plain striped shirts and urban outfitters-esque attire.Food: The fries were DELICIOUS- I will give them that. But they charge $8.00 for one side of fries! Thats highway robbery. I  ordered the Mediterranean breakfast with two poached eggs- very standard. I could definitely get this dish at a high-end diner or fast casual restaurant . I am glad I got to see what the hype is about but I would only return to try the ""Madame Freda"" dish and then probably won't come back again. 4,5 stars. Showed up in the middle of the week for brunch/lunch time and still had to wait for 45 mins. Ended up walking to a coffeeshop nearby, grabbing a cup of coffee and walking back so it worked out perfectly.Service was SUPER friendly and fast. The food delicious. Portions per price ratio just okay.Would still be back because of the cuteness of it all. Bookmark this one if you live here or your visiting NYC! The amazing staff starts to greet you upon entering this charming cafe, if your lucky to sit at the bar like me and get Dolan to take care of you, your definitely in good hands.I tried their Maya's Breakfast Bowl- perfect blend of spaghetti squash, kale, red quinoa, avocado, and roasted tomato....LOVED IT!Great portion, fresh ingredients, friendly service- they've got it dialed in.Try it, you won't be disappointed! This place was fantastic. I wish we also had time to come here for brunch, but we only made it here for dinner while in town. We arrived at 5:30 on a Wednesday evening, I'd recommend coming a bit earlier since you can't make reservations (except for larger parties). It was super empty when we arrived and we were seated immediately. We were seated in the corner booth table (who doesn't love booths?). I think they use the menus as placemats, because they never took them from us after we ordered. My sister ordered the matzo ball soup and the curry bowl, I opted for the schnitzel. I absolutely love schnitzel and this did not disappoint -- the chicken was juicy and tender with a wonderfully crisp and breaded outside (side note - why is it so hard to find schnitzel, anywhere?) I've never had matzo ball soup here but it was wonderful (especially on a cold day). My sister loved her curry, I'm not a huge curry person so I wasn't a huge fan, but at least she liked it.The service was great, everyone was super friendly. I ended up leaving my credit card behind and they were so awesome about it. When I called, the person asked me if I had left my credit card there before I even had a chance to finish my sentence, I told them my sister was going to pick it up for me (they had it stashed in the safe), and the waiter immediately recognized her when she came in. I would absolutely come here again and (sadly) I'd probably order the exact same thing.... There's a reason this place has such high reviews, excellent food, fantastic service... I only hope that I can also try the brunch someday. I've heard many great things about this place - even bookmarked as ""high priority."" Unfortunately they missed the mark one cold, weekday afternoon.  We came in without a reservation and were ready to wait a bit, as it was really packed. And wait we did. For about 25 minutes or so, which isn't too bad for a holiday week. I don't love the layout at Jack's Wife Freda; one long, communal table right in the middle, surrounded by smaller tables against the walls - making it almost impossible to walk towards your seat. We waited about ten minutes after being sat until we order. They were so busy they couldn't keep track of who was who. I feel like restaurants like this could really shine when they're busy. The servers seemed nice, but they really were just way too understaffed that day.The food was fine - nothing really stood out. Got a chicken prego and some fries. Lots of brunch places in the area are so much more worth the price and the wait. Dang, Freda! Your brunch game is on point. With a crowd of people waiting outside for 1+ hour, you know they must be doing brunch right. Jack's Wife Freda is the epitome of boozy brunch. It's a small, lively spot - you'll be sitting pretty closely with your neighbors who may or may not be doing shots. I got the poached eggs, which you can't really go wrong with. Perfectly poached and yolk-y, it made for a great social media story. My friend ordered a side of duck bacon, which she said was really good and a must try. Heard the rosewater waffle is also a must try, but we were already a bit full from our cheesecake pre-breakfast at Eileen's across the street. Hey, we had to kill time somehow! Takeaways: No reservations (so get in early to put your name down!), cantaloupe mimosa, madame freda all day everyday, good for small groups (2-4)The wait, the line are not overrated nor overhyped. This is a place I will return to for brunch on weekends with friends from out of town, but maybe not during peak hour between 11:30-1:00. Luckily, Jack's Wife Freda is located near many small shops and cafes so browsing around while waiting for a table to clear up is a solid option. No reservations, and it's a tiny space, so get there early with your full party to be seated!Pros:-looking for a boozy brunch? it'll be a bit pricey, but these bloody marys and cantaloupe mimosas will leave you happy for the rest of the weekend -sourcing is on point for dishes. i.e. tomatoes taste like real tomatoes, cucumbers like cucumbers. all fresh produce that hasn't lost its natural flavoring by way of being frozen in a former life or deconstructed by being over cooked-located right off the 6, convenient for those on the east side Cons:-long wait, lot of hangriness (but all the more to make the meal that much yummier)-cramped! you'll be seated with your friends for sure but don't expect a private conversation. you'll be sitting almost elbow to elbow with your fellow diners from another table The wait time during brunch is a bit obnoxious (and I didn't even wait my friends did bc they got there an hour earlier) but the food/drinks/service were amazing. Everything we ordered was so delicious and you can't order wrong since everything looked and tasted so good. Would come often but yeah.. that damn wait time. Expect the wait time to be over an hour on the weekends. But the wait is so worth it! The restaurant is tiny and cramped and it feels like your sitting on top of other people but the food is amazing here! Food is made fresh and not too heavy and the presentation is so chic! Meant to write a review after visiting this place a few weeks before New Year's. I had this place bookmarked for a while and took the opportunity to visit with my friend from out of town on a Saturday night. We were immediately seated despite it being packed. This place is definitely a brunch place for sure--wouldn't really come here for dinner.I really do appreciate how nothing is cooked with pork in this restaurant :) I ordered the duck prosciutto sandwich (Madame Freda) which was amazingly good. I never had that before and the pairing of a sunny side egg and gruyere cheese really went well together. My friend ordered the Greek salad and commented how fresh it was put together. The service here was nice too even with how small the place was. This place was recommended to me by a friend. As my NYC trip got closer, she reminded me that I needed to stop in for brunch multiple times. So I did. Quite pricey, but oh so delicious. I got the Medi breakfast which was complete with 2 poached eggs, a cucumber-tomato salad, labne, pita bread &amp; avo! Since I'm a cheese addict, I opted to add 2 pieces of halloumi cheese. Perfect. (except for the fact that it was a $7 addition. wow!) My friend got the Madame Freda which was a sandwich with duck prosciutto, gruyere, cheddar bchamel &amp; topped with a fried egg! I didn't try it, but my mouth watered as she did!When we first sat down we were quite hungry so we ordered the baguette hoping it would come before our meals. It didn't. BUT it was a delicious addition to the carbs already included in our meals. Had this place bookmarked for some quite time! I decided to finally check this place out with my friend. We both ordered the Mediterranean breakfast. She got the eggs poached and I got my sunny side up. The food was good! The little salad it comes with is super sour but doable. It was such a healthy meal! Would definitely come back to try more things but it gets crowded so go early! Cute places with killer brunch menus are what I live for! Jack's Wife Freda is totally worth the hype in my opinion.My friend and I got here around 9:45am and faced a ~30 minute wait, but it wasn't bad at all since we were able to do some window shopping in Soho. We started the meal with tall cups of fresh cantaloupe juice, which is just sweet, delicious, pulpy cantaloupe blended up. It's super refreshing and 100% worth a try! I ordered the green shakshuka, which was perfectly spicy and tangy and paired nicely with the rich, yolky eggs and fluffy challah. My friend got the tomato and halloumi Benedict, which was also scrumptious from the bite I tried. Everything was plated very attractively too. Portions skew towards the smaller side, which is good because you don't walk out feeling gross. The space itself is picturesque but cramped.I would recommend everything I tried here!!! JWF def makes it into one of my favorite brunch places. Cute little place in the city , great vibes but too loudy . The food is great I've tasted the waffle , it was really good. The owners are very nice ,as well . The place is clean and the bartenders were very polite (wevesat on the bar )The place looks very busy and I can understand why . Again , I'm not sure I'll be back for a round two but it as nice experience . Jack's Wife Freda is one of the best choices you have in the neighborhood full of hip spots. I've been here a couple of time in the past but somehow totally forgot to leave a review. So as I  was done shopping in Soho the other day, my bf and I decided to get dinner here. It's always crowded any time of the day but we were lucky enough to get a table outside right away. It's super noisy inside this tiny restaurant anyway. We ordered the Kefta Kebab, Peri-peri Chicken, and French Fries. I've only had brunch here so these are all new to me. The Kefta Kebab is lamb minced meatball with a lot of flavors coming from herbs and seasonings so the lamb smell is not overwhelming at all. It pairs great with the white sauce and pita bread. I LOVE the Peri-peri Chicken! It's a grilled chicken thigh with lots of seasoning on the skin, salsa salad and spicy guac(?) dipping sauce. It's seasoned so well and unique. The white meat is somewhat dry but it's unavoidable when you grill chicken. I highly recommend this dish. French Fries is delicious as well. The price is reasonable and the staff is beyond helpful. Definitely coming back for more! In my eyes, Jack's Wife Freda is one of the BEST causal brunch places in the city! If you're looking for a spot with a great abidance, friendly waitstaff, and a variety of food options to choose from look no further than Jack's Wife Freda.My friend and I decided to go to their Soho location on a calm Sunday afternoon. We had noticed there were already people waiting on the sidewalk (This place gets filled up fast), but no one had taken the two seats at the bar. We were offered and accepted since we really didn't care about sitting at a table.The waitstaff along with the bartender were extremely attentive. Right after we were seated they asked us our drink orders and gave us a few minutes to peruse the menu. I ended up choosing the Jack's Burger with a side of fires, along with their special hot sauce. All I can say is that I left full and satisfied beyond a doubt.A side note, this place does not take reservations for parties of two. If you're looking for table service either come early or be prepared to wait. It's that good. They also have a location on carmine street that is apparently less busy on Sundays? (That's only what I've been told)If you have the opportunity, definitely visit Jack's Wife Freda! You'll leave more happy (and more full) then when you had come in!",https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WdTzlh8NNKLgmxlkHlrGLw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GcNk7IdX8aKRdJfcAMhvRQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nrWmhh28-ETmNwDC3fiCBw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/juccPKJSO0i2F5lJwwyANw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CYC7doJD6iPZjHQktibKHg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/i3YfOlGBmul0ifSMH5Vckg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xYh1Ijkvuc3Cb703MzNgWg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/D1nRsLFl9kdDgZJM6rZz1A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/H70IZsDW5FOYHfAYsG0VjQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qj_CL5bEf8yYrsjKz08SSQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RI0CiFW6oYGZi4bLkq-dKQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0570xYksr8PWlCLdkJ8Rww/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lXaKoyv_XtWuFEy_dNbzPA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PLlNmVMGBj1q1ZKpiCgPhw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hq_X4VJglWRIE6K_UHz-Bw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2uw5tnYN6LSCGCUKAxVBAQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1wzRZmGFrK3xrCFIl2pZ5A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OwTvkU97M9mgFHlAvMkk9A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/brvGLa91-IsdjgZ2s9O3JA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/63dmBIfoNfK6MfkE1YNQjQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qE6Xeka26WeN5tLsH11E0g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yWoEDnm5dg4ko6xi6u5nNQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XQymcKA2uGUtqpFGK96wWQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YJ4Omh4mPu5HyZqXgS-FBA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pfSVu9zIsdoqWZbaXO8j3Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9xMO2c9Tepc3v40hD1RvpQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/46WLbwk9YtO8A7g6TG-CNQ/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/jadis-new-york,jadis-new-york,New York,10002,NY,French,Wine Bars,NA,"I planned my 25th birthday party with Jadis and was absolutely THRILLED with the experience! It was exactly what I had hoped for - a cozy, wine bar atmosphere with delicious apps and wine at a price that wouldn't break the bank. Edit helped me with planning and was fantastic. She helped me pick the menu for ~60 people at $40 pp and was extremely accommodating. We started off with a menu for wine and apps but she said that it was flexible. For example, if we chose mostly reds and guests were drinking more whites, she could swap them out for one another as the party went on. Same idea with the beer. The space was beautiful and I had 3 guests come over to me telling me it was the best party they had been to! If you are planning a party there, be sure to check it out beforehand and meet with Edit or another member of the staff. It was nice to put a face to a name and I found it was easier to communicate with her in person. Jadis does not disappoint, and I would highly recommend you plan your next event of up to 60 people there! I love Jadis (Zhaa-dee)! I was at VR place down the straight and needed to come back to reality. Jadis was a great place to do that and catch up with a good friend. A lot of first date/meet-ups here it seems. It was easy to overhear the convo of the two peeps right next to us who had met on a dating app.  We were at a table in the front as the back couches were full this time. I had the carafe the grapefruit rose sangria which was light and refreshing and the grapefruit was not overpowering. My friend had the kir royal which was equally good. I think I may have that next time.We stuck with the small bites this time around. We had the bruschetta, bacon-wrapped scallops, crab-cakes bites and smoked salmon on blinis. All were good, the tomatoes on the bruschetta were very ripe and slightly tangy, the bacon was the star in the bacon-wrapped scallops dish, and I was pleasantly surprised the crab cake bites as I normally don't like crab cakes. The salmon was probably the show stopper, though. Next time, I will explore more of the menu.Great service and ambiance. Our server checked on us multiple times and was always there when needed. I will not sit next to the heat pole next time. If you are always cold, then you should sit by it :P Loved this spot for happy hour. The happy hour deals were very good, and the food menu had tons of delicious-sounding bites. There was a single small table outside and we asked to be seated there. Excellent people watching. I had a couple glasses of the viognier before switching to another white. I ordered the ham, gruyere, and caramelized onion pressed sandwich. The sandwich was tasty and came with a delicious side salad that had the most perfect cherry tomatoes. My friend had the alsacienne tarte which was absolutely phenoms. I would definitely get that on a return visit. A visit to the bathroom revealed a really chic lounge area towards the back of the restaurant -such a cute place for a small group gathering. I'd love to return on a future visit to the city. Their wine list is great. Happy hour wine is $6-7/glass. They have an enormous back area with comfortable seating which I loved. Cant speak to the food they serve since we only stayed for drinks but everything coming out of the kitchen looked awesome! Not sure about the food here, but it's a perfectly cute little wine bar!Fair prices, cozy atmosphere and attentive service. I definitely would have gotten a charcuterie board, but we were too full so we just decided to split a bottle of wine. It was the perfect place to chat with friends and catch up for a nightcap! TRY ITTT.... I love the atmosphere here the muled wine (hot wine!) and they have the most tasty desserts ever!! Great food and ambience. We were seated at the bar. But they have a little lounge area with the couches. Great service. Like all the small plates we ordered. I've been to Jadis 4 times in the last 5 months which may lead myself to believe im a fan but after the last visit ive come to the conclusion that we end up there because of proximity, dim light ambiance &amp; fair prices.  However, somethings can be said about the service.  Happy hour is a good deal for the area, plenty of 5$ and 6$ a glass selections or wines and beer, we usually get a cheese &amp; meat board, pick 4 for $22 i believe it was, the mushroom puffs, flambes are good but wow, that beet salad was good.the setup is adorable, very european feel with a clutter of bookshelves, antiquey lights and really really really worn down soft sofas which sink once you sit down, that or you can opt for the uber hard stools with no back support.  the service has never been warm, its never been downright rude either however we always feel rushed to enjoy ourselves if the plates are emptied and our glasses are half full, the waitress' attitudes are very brusque and unwelcoming, they simply plop around and ask do you want another glass of that?  if you or someone answers no, they go off in a semi huffworth a visit if you're in the area but they are plenty of other if not better options A cute little spot! I enjoyed their cheese plate thats was $24. I got pecorino, gruyere, goat brie and camembert - it comes with bread, butter and grapes. We also got a bottle of red wine The design of the place is industrial and cozy and it was fairly crowded on a Tuesday night The staff is a little impatient and not attentive unfortunately. After an hour of looking for wine bars online, my friends and I decided to try Jadis. The food and wine completely surpassed our expectations! We got a bottle of the tasty Hungarian wine and I tried a glass of the Malbec. The service was quick and respectful and the charcuterie platter was divine. It was a special experience and I look forward to coming back soon. Cute wine and tapas bar!  We love coming for their happy hours.  We love sitting on the couches in the back cracking open a couple of bottles and having some cheese and meats.  They have good snacky food like the charcutuerie, the rillettes, escargot and a great variety in terms of wine.  The food is actually pretty good for a wine bar.  Service is always friendly and helpful.  The vibe is just right...kinda dim, with some music, and always a fun fun evening.. Perfect place for a mini-reunion of 10! As several observed, the lounge seating area felt like we were in someone's living room without anyone having to deal with clean up!  Food and drink was all superlative. Our orders ranged from a healthy salad to every kind of pizza on the menu, escargot, beet salad, some more appetizers I'm not remembering specifically and several desserts, of which the Hazelnut panna cotta left a particularly positive impression on me personally. As the various dishes got shared around the group I heard nothing but positive comments about the quality and serving sizes.  A winter gathering, the seasonal mulled wine was a HUGE hit though all drink offerings also got two thumbs up from one and all.Service was attentive, friendly and professional with very nice reminders about last call on Happy Hour. The value for money spent by our group was overall very high even after they added the automatic 20% for a party of our size. The group charge was completely understandable and appropriate.So why 4 stars instead of 5? They have a goofy reservation policy. They required a credit card for a group our size and asked that we cancel 3 days in advance (my plan only landed two days before so what if travel had screwed up?). When I asked how much they would charge if we didn't cancel in time I was told they don't charge, they just ask for the card number to encourage people to call. They are a small place so I can understand that holding a reservation that doesn't happen is a big deal. I'm guessing they've been stiffed by inconsiderate parties but really the resulting policy lacks logic. My credit card dispute policy became my backup plan so I gave them the card info. Since we all had such a truly fantastic night at this venue, I'm glad I took the risk but it did take a leap of faith, especially in Manhattan. I'd give them 4.5 stars if that was an option but just can't bring myself to give them a flawless 5 stars because of this first impression. super cute spot in the LES. great place for date night. they have a good selection of French wines at a decent price. haven't tried any of the food so definitely need to come back. Wine was good at this place. The server was very knowledgable about the wines. We said what we were in the mood for and she nailed a suggestion.The food was not as good as the wine. It was standard bar fare and nothing really elevated. The best thing we had were probably the mac and cheese bites. The bruschetta was average and the crab cakes fell apart and were kind of bland. I would come back for the wine not the food. Best kept secret. Sexy but casual. Had pate, salami, escargot, tarte. Rustic country French. Bean soup was a surprising favorite. Tasted like it was made by grandma. Wonderful smells like rosemary were wafting in the air from the kitchen. Charcuterie with happy hour wine and sangria? Look no further because Jadis has it! A cute restaurant in the lower east side, this place was the perfect spot to sit outside (only one table available at the front of the restaurant), drink some wine and eat some deliciously cut meat and cheeses. Although there is very limiting seating outside, the inside is wonderfully decorated as well, giving off a close and intimate vibe, great for dates or friend catch-up sessions.My boyfriend and I came here around 5 which was perfect as they have happy hour 5-7 Mon-Sat with $6-8 wines and sangria. I had their grapefruit sangria and it was deliciously made. It tasted super fresh and very well balanced. Great for a hot summer's day.As for the food, we started with the truffle mushroom risotto puffs. For $6, it was well-worth it. There were 4 delicious puffs of heaven. It had a crisp exterior from the filo dough and was soft and mushy on the inside from the rice and mushroom. The truffle was the perfect finishing touch. We also shared the mixed olives which was a yummy little plate of olives at $4. Both were great picks!As for the star, we got the platter of meats and cheese at $22. With that, you get a selection of 4 choices from a variety of meats and soft and hard cheeses. It also came with grapes, mustard and cornichons. We selected the Serrano ham, veal terrine, Fourme d'Ambert (a blue cheese) and Pierre Robert (similar to a brie but stronger). Everything was great for splitting between 2-3 people and they gave plenty of sliced baguette for the platter. At $22, it was so worth the price.Overall, it was a great experience. The service was so nice, very attentive. They constantly refilled our plates and checked on us to ensure we were enjoying our food and drinks. We definitely enjoyed everything. Delicious! Great food, service and ambience. Can't ask for a chiller spot to hang with friends! A return visit to this lovely little uncrowded dark french bistro space underlined a few of its strengths with a few new weaknesses.If you are looking for an affordable lovely European bistro spot with the basics, Jadis really shines in many ways - wines start at $9, with $40 bottles, and the food is pretty decent.  You can get single charcuturie or cheese items from $7-11, if you don't want to get a big board.  The small plates are good here - bacon wrapped scallops for $8 gets you about 7 medium barely bigger than bite sized scallops that are browned and just a little tender.The hazelnut panna cotta for $7 was creamy bliss, with a lovely blueberry caramel sauce, and just a nice perfectly small after diner size.The most enigmatic thing is that the service is so euro casual, almost ambivalent, you'll be waiting for perhaps ever to order something, and an additional something, since it's difficult to order more than one thing at a time.On the flip side it's nice not being rushed, but damn, I waited at least 15 minutes to order a wine after being seated, I had to stop someone 15 minutes later for a second glass and to order food, in this case duck rillette, $10.  An order of scallops, dessert and a third wine demanded I get up and order at the bar.  That kind of service doesnt match the lovely space on one hand, on the other, it does, you can spend three hours there and no one is going to bat an eyelash.The duck rillette wasn't as good this time, partly because of presentation.  It just looked and tasted a little haphazard.Atmosphere - dark lovely bistro Food - basic French small plates, sandwiches,      Quiche, salads and a few mains.Service - oddly absent, but you get to linger as long as         you want.Value - 3 wines, 3 small plates - $50.   A good sort of poor man's fine dining downtown. Decent wine happy hour and the food smelled good but I had to answer a quick work email and their Wi-Fi cost money. The bar is in a basement with less than amazing reception and it's 2017. So I decided to move somewhere this deluxe service would be included in my purchase. Nice staff. Poor mgmt, clearly. Will go back once I lose my job to try the bacon wrapped scallops. It's a shame. You can easily walk past this place and not know it. Tucked on a small side street and surrounded by mostly residential buildings, Jadis is a diamond in the rough. They have happy hour every day from 5-7 with wines ranging from around $6-9. The food menu boasts quiche, olives, meats and cheeses. Very cozy decor - rustic book cases in the front make me feel like I'm not even in the city. They have leather couches in the back, which sort of give the place a bachelor-pad feel, but if you're into maximum comfort, they do the job. I'd come here again if in the area.",https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fkpYUCwqIP-E3kBh2uJgPA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ae_z4WQsdJFOdZaIktbocw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YKL4BcuI8vyXFCTL31aDFw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DIIN1I9cZGS6md56N-_eMQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lJzZUYEgbGzNFoWdgG7tuA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TNddtS1F66OCFhw7dIvH8Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ReoAnnfkyAkcA8uYWavCKQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SBO7Ok-97bB2G9haloeopw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ewR46qjZyWozh5buZ7JEVA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ff8RUOInf_T12BR_GWPThw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PkDoLwK1gIBneQ4CC2VPSA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dcyppZEXm1F6Ym09EQhyYQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KL4awMdSr0zZlUjNXDKz_g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wRx_LzskFLiozXrRaSrzWg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/skov6rW6XYphKbO3F2ZC0A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1tVBgpmUpnefdhEmdueS2g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Xy2AnLvQjeYCx1-xgtt2Uw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kFhy4XyfUnxohgW_RZTBAg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lcN1mIiwegcLFB9e1GH3mA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Abvo0LeHs-Qfn2Uo4PRTCQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JOjsw7MyQ2aNMzq1mSQp3A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-BpYJ-JY4gQASuV7bsXqRA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NMSk46u_slsLJlauqilheQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Tecvorf4ep3Q5YI3PeXYXA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Xt2vuCd7fSbCRY3kEC_8eQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GxhkFeHXjflabXMQ3EgXfw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9Q1_v-FbRH54G2HNEIx_GQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lROjsq_7j74SjBeRLZVukQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wRG1dZTBVUx6AtNtXeA3tg/258s.jpg,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/jajaja-new-york,jajaja-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Mexican,Vegan,Bars,"Two words: Vegan Mexican. I honestly wasn't sure what to expect for an all vegan Mexican restaurant. Everything I love about Mexican food is centered around meat. On top of that, Vegan alternatives can be super hit or miss. Thankfully, it was a definite hit on their part. First of all, the smell upon entering this place is absolutely mouthwatering. The staff are accommodating, welcoming and check up on you regularly which is always nice. As for the food, I was blown away. My friend and I ordered their vegan nachos and cocktails to start. I tried the Matcha y coconut (very sweet and refreshing) and my friend got their margarita (extremely sweet, but still so good). The nachos were stupid good, topped with this amazing vegan cheese, meat, and mountain of guacamole. Like, I can die happy. We both ordered fish tacos, which we weren't sure how we felt about ""vegan fish."" The fish is a cucumber-like veggie that was breaded. It was okay, but I wish I had tried something else on the menu that wasn't trying to mock fish. Overall, I cannot wait to be back. They also have a smaller shop connected to the restaurant if you want to order to-go. Wow, Mexican Vegan! Who would have ever heard of such a thing? This hole in the wall gem is to die for! For your vegan lovers, be prepared to satisfy your inner Mexican food cravings. First off, staff are nice and welcoming. The setting, and mood of the restaurant felt homie, with spanish'esque music playing. However, the restaurant felt somewhat crammed and squished, so I recommend you order your dishes one at a time. Regardless, savor the flavors and take your time enjoying your meal! If your on the go, then you can always order for takeout. Now, onto the food. We (Me &amp; gf) started with a nacho appetizer, which was highly filling and filled with delicious flavors. It absolutely boggles me how one can manipulate flavors so well, emulating a meat taste and texture. Afterwards, we went onto the main course: Papusas. My girlfriend is Mexican, so she explained to me exactly what it was. It was a Torta (filled tortilla) with meat or vegetables layered on top. Again, it was delicious. My girlfriend ordered the Chorizo Buritto, which was decorated with a sauce dressing, representing the Mexican flag. I was able to taste some of the Burrito, which again, was delicious.I most definitely recommend if you're looking to try something new. For you fellow Mexican Vegans whom are in search of reconnecting with traditional Mexican food, this is your spot. Bravo, jajaja. I had low expectations for this place based on a few reviews from friends. After dining here a few times, I wonder if I can ever trust them again. I am thoroughly impressed by the innovative and thoughtful dishes. They did not rely on Daiya or Vegenaise as most veg restaurants do and they even went so far as to use fermented beans. Our server, Justin, was an absolute delight and seemed just as excited as we were about our experience. He even offered me a sample of the soup (which is more annoying than anyone who hasn't worked in a restaurant can imagine). I can't wait to go back and try more dishes. Since this place is only 5 minutes away from my work, I decided to try this place for lunch. Since the fish taco seemed like the most popular menu, I got it. It's $8 per two tacos but if you pay $3 more, you can get 3 three tacos of a same kind. I also got Mexican hot chocolate ($4.50) which was rich and delicious. It was missing the spice and cinnamon I like about Mexican hot chocolate but I still enjoyed it. I tried one bite from my friend's plate which was sweet chile relleno ($10) and it had well-balanced flavor as well. I was definitely happy about feeling full and healthy and I'll be back for sure. They knocked it out if the park. As a vegan from Texas, I really appreciate good Mexican Food. This is one of the best Mexican food places in the city, began or not. This is better the meat dishes I have had in the past. I came in the first time in my own. I sat at the bar and had the Mezcal drink and small (huge) nachos. The flavor was amazing. It had their own vegan chorizo too. I ordered this as an app, but I could not eat more. I ended up taking some home too. The bartender was really nice. She was having a good time chatting with the couples next to me and being a great bartender, so it did take me a while to get her attention. The second time I came with friends. They had a frozen aperol drink. I had the Margarita and Sangria frozen drink. It wad the best I have had since Aqui in the bay area. We ordered the large nachos (humongous)  they were still amazing. We also got the chayote ""fish"" tacos. They were the bomb. Two tacos are eight bucks, and you can order an additional taco of the same kind. The music is great. The ambiance is fun, and the food and drinks are perfect. I will definitely be back. Let me start off with the food OMG it was so delicious. First i had the gauc so tasty then I had the spicy tinga tacos and the palm carnitas tacos which were phenomenal, and then i had a pupusa. This vegan food at its A game great place. It does get pretty packed so there might be a bit of wait but it sure is worth it. Also the drinks are delicious bartenders are professional service is very attentive and friendly and they also have a great music selection. I recommend everyone tries this awesome restaurant This place is vegan heaven. We got three kinds of tacos, and 2 were insanely delicious, and the other was good. The nachos are superb, they layer the ""cheese"" and toppings so the bottom has just as many goodies as the top. Service was great, ambiance is trendy and cool. I can't wait to come back for more tacos! This place is amazing and I eat all cuisines. They add amazing flavor into food and drinks! You will appreciate it along with the decor and service. We ended up here after a friend's show on a Sunday night. Not the traditional place for Sunday nights out but we were pleasantly surprised by this place.I even asked the bartender for one of the drink recipes because I liked it that much. Groups: It is small so don't bring a large group. I was really excited about trying out a vegan Mexican place and was slightly surprised by how small and cozy the place is. That said, I was really pleased upon being seated because the booth seats open up and you can put your coats and the rest of your stuff away and enjoy yourself without being smushed by your and your friends' crap. Here are my general thoughts:Ambiance: Casual but intimate setting. Low-lighting, as evidenced from the lack of clarity in the posted pictures. Service: Amazing! My friend has a severe nut allergy and our server was incredibly accommodating and understanding about having to asking the kitchen about ingredients. 5 stars. Food: The nachos were delicious, but it was the typical nacho issue where there could have been more toppings and ""cheese"" sauce given the amount of tortilla chips. Still, delicious. I had them months ago and often, when my mind wanders, it's to those nachos. I got the pupusas which were also delicious! I'm usually a little wary of vegan pupusas because I've had the homemade traditional ones and those are pretty mind blowing. However, these were great and I'd even recommend to a non-vegan Salvadoran (pupusas originate from El Salvador, and I'm thankful to them every day for it). 4.5 stars. Drinks: The drinks were interesting and different and tasty, but not very strong for the price. 4 stars. Overall, I will definitely go back and try other things on the menu and highly recommend! Finally made it to Jajaja and I can honestly say it was amazing.  From the moment I walked in the hostess was friendly and made sure to make my fiance and I feel welcomed.  The atmosphere was great, the music was perfect and the energy felt great inside. Before being seated we both had a spicy pomegranate y jalapeno which was perfect.  It was exactly the right everything.We finally sat down and right away the waitress introduced herself and brought over some water.  She was friendly and made us feel very welcomed.  It didn't take us long before we ordered the nachos which were without a doubt amazing!!  If you like nachos I would highly recommend you order this here, you won't be disappointed.  We then both ordered some tacos and I must say the flavor was outstanding and everything else was perfect.  We also ordered the mexican street corn which was flavorful and just incredible. I can't say enough about this place and I can tell you for sure I'll be back for some more delicious food.If you want a great meal, service, ambience and restaurant priced well then this is the spot!  Don't miss an opportunity for an amazing meal. Came all the way from San Diego CA to try the restaurant. The vegan Mexican nachos where delicious. The place is small and it's located in China Town. It was worth the walk. Lol The newly made vegetarian wife has been excited about going to this place so we went on a Friday around 5:30. Got a drink at the bar then were seated right away I got the Chorizo Burrito with cauliflower rice, black beans, and guac smothered in Sour Cream &amp; Salsa. It was amazing. Def doesn't have that chorizo taste, but that's not the point. The cauliflower rice was an excellent carb substitute, the fermented black beans were great and the smothering sauce was PHENOMENAL. Wife and friends got tacos. 2 Buffalo (Cauli) Flower tacos and 1 chorizo taco. They were quite pleased with their meals.The pomegranate &amp; jalapeo cocktail is spicy deliciousness!! 1-2 is the perfect amount.Food is perfectly priced. Drinks are a little more expensive than one would want, but made with love and care. Being on the same block as the F train make this very accessible eats. So far I've only been here twice but I have to say I feel so lucky to live so close to such a great vegan spot. I've been to a number of vegan/veggie spots such as nix or dirt candy but I still (surprisingly) like this place best. Firstly, the place is not too big or anything. But it is at a pretty good spot being at the corner of an intersection so you can people watch and it's right next to a subway stop for people that have to travel here. The atmosphere is also pretty chill and they also have a cactus in the bathroom which is nice for character but nothing too spectacular. The service is pretty good too. I've never had an issue with the service and the people are very inviting and friendly which allows me to enjoy myself more easily. The most important thing is the food tho which I have to say is amazing here. Nachos taste like legit nachos, empanada is no joke, and the bowls were great with an amazing dressing. Even compared to places like dirt candy or nix, I thought the food was better here. It probably because the food here is more relatable and not anything too unfamiliar (although nothing compares to dirt candy's presentation). I would definitely recommend this place even to meat eaters. The food is just impressive in general. And if you're looking for vegan food and are feeling Mexican, I would even say this place is worth traveling to (which makes it nice that it's next to a subway station). Chlorophyl. Is that something that sounds like a safe word or a vegan ingredient? ohhh yeah... got you thinking. But seriously, you see that on the menu and if you are the type of person that wants to explore and are curious -- you have to have it. It's something that can go really wrong or really good. This was amazing. Everything on the menu is worth exploring. Few places can do vegan with fun, taste and innovation. This place delivers. The coctails are awesome. Great for date night. One of my best friends is vegan and his favorite food is Mexican, so he was pretty stoked to hear of Jajaja's existence. We came by on a Sunday afternoon and were immediately drawn into the bright, festive interior. The walls and ceilings are all wooden panels, the floors are made up of colorful tiles, and beaded curtains hang in different areas of the restaurant.The menu is pretty eclectic. Don't come here for your standard burritos and tacos. The tortillas on their taco menu are all made of unique combos like blueberry &amp; flax seed, tumeric, and tomato &amp; beet. The fillings are just as interesting - jackfruit and chipotle almond butter are a couple of the stranger ingredients. Outside of tacos, you can get things like nachos, tostadas, ceviche, pupusas (!), and even french toast at brunch. The cocktail menu is notable, with more funky concoctions like matcha, coconut and tequila, or cilantro, mezcal and coconut. I went with the pupusas because it's a dish I grew up with that I very rarely see in NYC. As far as pupusas go, they certainly weren't the ones I grew up with, nor was I expecting them to be, but all in all they were tasty. I paired them with the 'Matcha y Coconut' cocktail which ended up being a little too umami for my taste. I wanted it to be a little more coconut-y and less matcha-y. Perhaps matcha just doesn't belong in cocktails...My friend went with the nachos and was a fan! Very beautiful presentation of the nachos as well. All in all it was a pretty good visit, but neither of us were particularly blown away by the food or drink. The principle concern for omnivorous NYers (myself included) re. vegetarian/vegan is less ""i can't live without meat"", and more a fear that meatless dining won't have any flavor to it. After all, it's true that for the uninitiated, non meat products conjure grim visions of iceberg salads, vegan brownies, rice milk and other awful concoctions etc.Jajaja changed all this for me. Though there are no animal/animal products here, you wouldn't even suspect it unless someone explicitly told you. Only after had I finished eating (my burrito) that I was told by my server that the entire menu actually was meat free. At first I felt taken aback, but since I was on a roll, I decided to get the flan with coconut whipped cream as well. To my surprised, coconut whipped cream turned out to be even better than the regular stuff. This flan is distinct from that which utilizes eggs and milk- still very good, though textually different. I came back another afternoon and tried the Chayote 'fish' tacos, which were also excellent. The interior bears its own special mentioning: it's absolutely beautiful here. They managed to do the windows in such a way that the light that hits this corner of e. bway is fully maximized, giving the inside a classic lazy sunday afternoon kind of lighting, which exudes a sense of calm, and makes you forget you're in nyc. Another thing about the layout is the partition down the middle of the store: the left segment being the restaurant, the right segment selling items (tacos) to go. They also sell their signature, homemade hot sauces here, which were all incredibly good in my opinion, and made my chorizo burrito that much more enjoyable.I am slightly conflicted about this review because of the nature of my first experience- it's as if Jajaja obfuscates the fact the menu is meatless. Items such as ""our chorizo"" and ""chayote fish"" might seem a little suspicious upon close inspection, but to your average, voracious diner, it's not something they'd notice. It might have been nice to know what I was eating before I ordered, but perhaps this is strategic, in order to lower the boon on overly critical, self professed 'carnivores' only once it's too late- they will have already enjoyed their food, as it happened in my caseOverall, a great foray into the vegetarian variety. With lots of classic dishes, a beautiful interior, a 4.5 rounded up is a fair assessment of this restaurant- excited to go back soon. Amazing! The mole enchilada is the bomb, the inside has jackfruit which you can not even tell isn't meat! Great for anyone who wants a healthier Mexican dish.  No cheese used, but everything is packed with flavor! Jajaja, I am in love. This place is incredible in so many ways. The food is creative, tasty, filling, and surprisingly very well priced. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The atmosphere is casual and the location is conveniently right next to the subway. I am so happy Jajaja exists. To find good vegetarian Mexican food is usually very difficult because almost everything including rice and beans normally has chicken broth and/or lard. This place has an extensive menu of authentic tasting dishes that are all vegan. The food is heavy on flavor but light on the stomach and you don't leave feeling gross even after eating a chorizo burrito and breaded fish tacos. The fish tacos, burrito, and enchiladas were all outstanding. It was a real treat to have mol sauce, which traditionally is cooked with meat products. The presentation of the chorizo burrito is beautifully done, with a perfect coating of three different colored sauces. The nachos are enormous and filling. They can definitely be ordered as a full meal. I will definitely be coming to Jajaja frequently. It is very unusual to find such a high quality, accessible vegan restaurant with such fair food prices. I am sure this place will do very well going forward. WOW. Blown away by this spot!! There was a 45 min wait but TOTALLY worth it and I can see why the wait- this place was so good! The service was phenomenal but the food... oh the food.. it was top notch vegan food and the menu was marked with whats gf and whats spicy. The server recommended a few menu items- chorizo nachos, chorizo burrito, and something else. So, we started off with the chorizo nachos- great recommendation- crispy multi colored chips, creamy queso (couldn't even tell it was vegan), fresh guacamole, good tasty salsas, fermented black beans. The flavors were on point to say the least! For our mains- I got the carnitas tacos, my bf got the chorizo burrito, friend got the civiche, other friend the dino kale bowl. Carnitas tacos were so dang good. Pulled jackfruit seasoned perfectly, good taco toppings, microgreens, and a soft blue tortilla- I loved every bit of it! I tried my friends civiche and that was very very convincing! Made with hearts of palm and seasoned like authentic civiche, served with plantain chips- I loved it!My bfs chorizo burrito was so beautiful he didn't even wanna cut into it- but when he did I took a bite, mmm, also a good dish suggestion. My friend with the kale loved it as well and ordered tortillas on the side to go with it. I cannot wait to come back and to show more friends. The space is very nice, not too tight, the bar is beautiful, the bathrooms are so cute and Mexican decor throughout, the open kitchen with women chefs topped it off. I WILL BE BACK!!! Fulfilling Mexican cravings without all that oily, porky guilt: This is the strategy at Jajaja, which also happens to be casually vegan. I say casually vegan because it's not an in-your-face vegan place, and the general lack of tofu and substitute plant-based meats actually works in their favor. Cocktails are visually stunning but lack an alcoholic punch, but the nachos made up for it and I'd actually mainly endorse this place for the nachos alone. Some of the larger plates are hit and miss (I was a bit confused by my veggie bowl) but my friends were into their pupusa and burrito. Order the nachos.",https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YX6iy-lJaDCVZ2luXAHHRw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/N3j_RaNlwINF4OHFrgP8vw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lgxSlemykZi0LwJfUKpcWQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QaIhCEp1FpU3a2teWQh6mA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qzOI2tiGsZQywvWXy4WnYw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kD3r6Od6VEIBPU4DahYreg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/J7Iv-IrCHVOfbx75yrdoPQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CdLqXMc7rTB-NyvWXlCnEg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/foijBWjyvJXgG0bMYK1M9Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/q_-eCQmKA9neb5Wi3p-4lQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UXfqdKcgA1fMV3NTzJjtUA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HmLhxPY6Ds5J-BS9ZylciQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_X1Fy9Qtf58zmbLlKd-2yw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xETSrPB3xISaxhl5vy40QQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LNDTRn5wMWWbsg58sR4ZxQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/niViO-N9Vl10e4mWHombFg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Efs98EBKYq6Ie47ipMqdUg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UdLNxaX-A8-N2bCUFN8sfQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4aD7WTYZ7EXbOQFcycxUzw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0vwFjtw9BDpaFof8NAhZ3g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/x2nQEMk2aLW-dU4be6k6yw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Bdxza6WVAxoPbxJw_LI01A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YeDYvtTYCNNZUlWJVHwqMQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OJNF4sEMItIJk9KzaEYVgA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WVfqg06t7s7ESCFsc8AM2A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Ab8L2lmt9QXUFjs1adrkbQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cNJbe-Jpkr-wA8av9ZO8DA/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/jing-fong-restaurant-new-york,jing-fong-restaurant-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Dim Sum,Cantonese,NA,"This is our go to Dim Sum place. My mother in law refuses to go almost anywhere else. The place is huge, but almost always packed on weekends. Carve out a morning and just start pointing at whatever looks good. They'll take care of the rest.Lately they've been catering to a more bak gwei crowd (like myself), which I'm generally not a fan of, but the random nutella/drink cart going around isn't too much of an inconvenience. Visiting new york to take care of some businesses and this was a recommended place. Always a long line very popular.They have the old fashioned push carts with the food items so that's kind of cool as most places now are built with more seating so it's harder to to navigate the carts in most places.Being from Chicago and having had dim some many times I have to say the food quality and tastes of this place is 1 star.Also the fact that they have smaller parties share tables together I not a fan of. It's ok and I understand due to the large size of the banquet hall it's understandable, but I prefer to have q party per table no matter the size.They get 1 star for food and 1 star for service.Will definitely not be back. There is a popular place the flushing Chinatown that blows this place away. It's been a while since I've been to Jing Fong. What has always been true about Jing Fong as the largest dim sum restaurant in Manhattan's Chinatown is still true today. There are large crowds and its presence in many guide books makes it a destination for many tourists and locals alike. I heard that there was a renovation not too long ago and it really shows. The color of the restaurant is a muted brownish gold tone with warm lighting. I noticed there's a new bar that serves liquor and beer. There's a dim sum cooked food station, large chandeliers and new updated dim sum baskets. All in all it's a pleasant dining room to sit in if you don't mind the din of a thousand fellow diners chatting away next to you. We had a standard dim sum meal. We had items such as cheong fun, chicken feet, leaf wrapped sticky rice, spring rolls, ham shui kok, har kaw, and sweet and sour pork. We concluded that Jing Fong is still up to par when it comes to dim sum quality and variety. The only small problem here is service. We left a teapot open for nearly 45 minutes before having to wave down a waiter to refill the pot. Also, the circulation of the dim sum was a bit inconsistent. We sat for two hours and found that some new dim sum didn't make it to our side of the restaurant until toward the end of our meal. It would have been nice to circulate the carts around the entire restaurant so we would get a nice variety. I also got the sense that the restaurant is a bit understaffed both in terms of the cart ladies and the waiters. Despite this everyone we dealt with were nice and cordial.As for value, we were happy that the small dim sum were $3.25. However, there is a five tier list of prices, topping out at $13.25. In my opinion, if you order something that is $13.25, you may as well order an entre. It is us to the dim sum cart ladies to determine which tier your dim sum belongs to. Finally a pro tip here is that if you come in a small group, maybe 2 or 3 diners, you will get a table first because they could squeeze you into any shared table. Jing Fong was and still is one of my main Manhattan dim sum restaurants on my Manhattan repertoire. I am continuously shocked that dim sum places in NYC actually charge for tea. The actual dim sum plates here were disappointing. As someone that went to dim sum every weekend back home, I feel like I know good dim sum and this place isn't it. Sticky rice in lotus leaf is a fav of mine but my friend and I agreed that the rice was gross. A lot of the offerings were cold which is pretty strange since there are so many people you'd expect that the food would have a quick turn around. Turnip cakes were loaded with taro. That's confusing. At $11 a plate, no thx bye. The space itself is massive. As any other restaurant in Chinatown, don't expect good service, if at all. Sharing tables with other parties is common so cross your fingers and hope that you sit with people who aren't savages :)))))Still on the look out for a good dim sum spot. Good cheap Chinese dim sum place in the heart of Chinatown. Very authentic in every way, including their service. (There is almost no service but that's how dim sum is like in Hong Kong too)If you have never had dim sum before, this is a good place to start. They have all the dishes you can think of from chicken feet to cow intestine stew. There will be carts going around the table, but for some popular items, you gotta spot it yourself and head to the cart to grab what you want.If you are here to be pampered, you will be disappointed. But if you are here to get your tastebuds pampered, then you gonna love it here.Tips:- dishes have different pricing, but everything is still cheap We pre reserved a table for 8 on Thanksgiving for lunch, kind of keeping with that A Christmas Story vibe, lol.Everything we tried was very good although I was a little disappointed that some of the dim sum items that I had hoped would be on the carts were not. Specifically I was hoping for some soup dumplings and for dessert maybe some egg tarts.The only other issue I would have to point out to anyone in a similar situation is that my husband has a shellfish allergy and it is a little difficult to determine from some of the wait staff whether or not the item that you are choosing has any shrimp or other shellfish in it... We still got those items for the table we just were trying to determine if it was something that he could eat or not so I felt as if he ended up with the short end of the stick as far as options because there were so many things that we just weren't quite sure if any allergens were present.It was fun, we ate until we had to waddle out! These people be crazy yo. Jing Fong is a huge, loud banquet hall with a ton of space and enormous round tables, and a section for weddings, so it's ideal for groups, but the food sucks and is overpriced. Why did I drop $50 on a bunch of lame dishes and leave still hungry? The chicken dumplings are extremely dry. The stuffed eggplant is super oily. The beef meatballs tasted like pure shit molded together. The shrimp patties were okay, but so salty. My friend got pork dim sum and another bacon dish, and didn't like them. Genuinely could've gotten better food at Taco Bell. The beers were super small for the price too. Their service is brusque, but quick or organized, I'll give them that, but I wish we'd gone elsewhere. I don't know. This place is huge and maybe overhyped with lots of tourist who are at the place. Again, the place is huge so normally finding a seat shouldn't be a problem. It definitely feels like a nice meal when there are customers who are enjoying the place. Feels fancy with the escalator and big chandelier leading up the dim sum restaurant. People have weddings here to, so don't be surprised if on a typical day, you get seated on a regular table elevated on the stage. They're just utilizing all the space available! Other than the experience of feeling good, the food is decent. Not the best dim sum I've had and definitely not the cheapest. I find that depending on where you sit, the cart ladies may not pass your table frequently or you may miss some food if the ladies never make it to your table. With that said, you might need to get up with your order sheet and walk around to look for the ladies yourself, which I think defeats the fun out of dim sum, part of the fun is enjoying food without doing the work! On a typical day when I do want dim sum, I don't think I'll head here. Unless possibly I'm bringing a friend visiting or want to show someone a vibrant and popular/cultural atmosphere. Maybe. I wasn't happy with our meal but apparently it's a popular restaurant. I don't know why because the prices are steep. I think the two dollar signs on Yelp are for the lunch special because dinner is at least $20 per person. And we were very careful not to order a lot.We ordered the $15 plate of Beef lo Fun and fortunately it was a huge portion. It could feed 2 comfortably. However, we were very hungry so we also ordered a side order of chicken steamed buns and spinach dumplings.The beef lo fun I didn't like at all. The noodles had a strange taste. Almost as if the noodles were boiled in rancid water. I swallowed it whole just to get some food in my stomach. The beef pieces were okay but scarce and the onions were super strong...almost as if they weren't cooked. The spinach dumplings were fine. Nothing special. I wish we ordered more of the steamed buns because those were good. But then again, it's hard to ruin a steamed bun. After spending a good $15 each on dinner we were full...but that have been because the noodles made me lose my appetite. I had never experienced dim sum before entering Jing Fong, but from what my friends have told me, it's quite a fun experience--not only with the company you invite with you, but for your taste buds.On the two occasions I visited, my friends and I ordered a variety of items from the menu: pork buns, sui mai, dumplings, spring rolls, wontons, turnip cake, bacon wrapped seafood balls (or fried shrimp, I can't recall) as well as roasted duck, mayo shrimp, steak filet with onions, and the list goes on and on. Everything here is family style and extremely affordable, especially in this city. Similar places will charge double for what they did here. Granted, the service isn't the best, but as long as you get your order in and correct, what can you complain about?The location is up a long escalator down a side street in Chinatown, and the seating area is similar to a banquet hall. I've heard they do special celebrations for Chinese New Year and it is available for other occasions. My favs to order: mayo shrimp, turnip cake, and bacon wrapped seafood (shrimp)! The dim sum here is just alright given that my standard is based on growing up eating dim sum in San Francisco and Oakland Chinatowns. If you're in New York and need your dim sum fix, but aren't near Brooklyn or Flushing, this place is satisfactory.This has to be the largest dim sum restaurant I've ever been to. I don't think words can do it justice on how massive the capacity of this place. As a result, they have decent turnover and the lady at the front must have rattled off 10 numbers In a row. Beware if you wait outside because you won't be able to hear your number and they aren't about to go out there to find you either.As for the food, the cool thing is that there are tons of carts and there is also an area where you can bring your ticket up to get food. They have clams, vegetable, tripe/ tendon, turnip cake, etc.The spare ribs and chicken feet were pretty good and probably the best out of the bunch. Lotus seed paste bun was on the smaller size.Overall, it's worth a try if you find yourself in the Manhattan Chinatown area. Seems to be very friendly for large groups. I came here with three friends, and the servers rarely checked on us. There was a large event that took up about half of the giant banquet hall; the party was separated by a divider, but the event was very loud and disruptive for us. Perhaps there was a shortage of staff, but we waited a long time to get served and get our checks. The dimsum was standard quality.-- taste / 3aesthetics / 2vibe / 2service / 1price for quality / 4OVERALL / 2.5 10/08/2017I've been to this restaurant a few times, and reason being the food is worth the wait. However, sadly this visit was a disappointment. Not only did I have to get up and chase the food carts but the selection was very limited, rice rolls, spring rolls, and fish and beef balls. Mind you they seated us at e other end of the room the furthest point from the kitchen, and any food carts that made to to us were carrying the dishes no one wanted, do repeatedly I had to get up and walk to the other end of the room! I would've taken pics of the food but it was devoured by the time I rested the plate on the table, because after a 35 minute wait no body wants to wait for meager food carts that never show! So disappointing, after this experience I'm seriously thinking about calling it quits! On a happy note, they have a bathroom attendant so the bathroom was quite clean :)Happy Yelping! Not my favourite place for dim sum, all though they do have specials that can save you money. I felt like the place was dirty. When you first walk in you think it is going to be an amazing experience because the room is so large and the staff is dressed nicely but it is a let down once you get past the chandelier. Our tea pot and cups had left over food smudges. I could tell the had been sanitized but not wiped. I get that it didn't break any food codes but it doesn't make the experience better to have to wipe off your own cup before you drink out of it. Also, the floor looked like it hadn't been vacuumed in days. It was filthy. On the upside some of our dishes were delicious.If you go try the following:The dim sum sampler plateThe eggplant (it is not the tradition Cantonese flavors but still good)The mayonnaise shrimp with nuts (I know that sound gross but omg it is good)We didn't try any desserts so I can't recommend anything in that category. Tripe stew or offal stew is one of my favorite dishes. I remember I used to sit on the corner of the street back home and enjoyed a hot bowl of tripe stew after school. Since moving to the States, I haven't found anywhere to make tripe stew like back home until my last visit to NYC. I was so happy that I found a restaurant made good tripe stew! I will be back for sure, despite their bad customer services. That's why I'm giving them a three star. The place to go for authentic dim sum! I went with a group of 5 friends this past Saturday and despite arriving around 12pm, we were able to get seated within 10 minutes. I picked this place out to give that authentic hustle and bustle feel of traditional dim sum place in Hong Kong and this place did not disappoint. As many have stated, it's a huge palace of a place with carts rolling throughout, weaving between the banquet tables. Food was pretty spot-on. We were hungry and ordered right away - hargow (steamed shrimp dumpling), tripe, siu mai, spare ribs, bean curd pork roll, and changfun (what they call shrimp rice noodles). Their changfun was so delish (available in beef and shrimp - i got shrimp both times) and authentic with right amount of flour to shrimp ratio. We also got pan-fried turnip cakes, sauteed veggie, and clams in black bean sauce from the side station. They were all spot-on except beware the higher price (e.g. clams were $12.95 compared to regular dim sum plates ranging from $3.50 - $5).Because the turnip cakes were taking a while, we went up twice only to come back to wait some more. Then we were pleasantly surprised when the lady came over to our table and served us the cakes once they were done. (We were sitting right in front of the side tables) That was a nice gesture. Since the place is huge, I had to get up and hunt for char siu bao (steamed BBQ roast pork bun) and egg custard bun. CSB is spot-on delicious - not too big and doughy with nice chunk of meat inside. Tea is $1 per person as is the tradition in dim sum joints, and they kept it flowing throughout. We also had the silken tofu with ginger syrup as a dessert and it was divine. Service was generally very good. The ladies were friendly and could understand and speak some English, and they weren't overly pushy with the food recommendations. They were also nicer than your average Chinese servers, often smiling and even joking. I did use some broken Chinese here and there so I think that certainly helped. :) Tip: Sitting right in front of the side buffet area (and the kitchen) is a good idea. I even had the bill brought and taken from me though normally I would need to go pay up front. Also, rest rooms aren't too far from there as well. Btw, rest rooms are bright, spacious, and clean for those of you a bit squeamish about using public restrooms esp. in Chinatown. Bill came out to like $103 for 6 people not shying away, so ended up around $21 per person. On a hindsight, I would probably skip the clams and other expensive items and get more of the regular dishes. It's not for everybody - especially not for people who like a bit more peaceful dining experience. But I for one left very content with a full belly (no stomach issues afterwards) and will be back again for a leisurely weekend brunch this time over some of their cocktails. This place was crazy. I think there were at least 500 seats and everyone was having DIM SUM (Yes, we were there on a Sunday). Be prepared to wait a bit for a table. We were a party of 6 but that was fine (we took a walk while we waited). I  can not tell you how much dim sum we had -did not disappoint. steamed shrimp, noodles, I did not love the beef or the pork however -too tough to chew. This place is noisy so don't expect intimate conversation!  I love dim sum so its hard to disappoint me. Not expensive at all. Recommend highly. This large banquet hall of dim sum is scumptious. Since the restaurant is so large, it's hard to flag down the carts so it's recommended you just go up and order. Better yet, you can sit right outside where the carts come out of the kitchen and get first dibs (like we did). This is the first dimsum I've had in NYC so all I have to compare with Jing Fong are dimsum restaurants in Philadelphia! The egg tarts here were some of the best I've had at dimsum. I would also recommend getting the tripe, zhongzi (sticky rice with pork wrapped in a lotus leaf). We ordered a table full of food, which we didn't end up finishing, and ended up costing everyone around $20. I enjoyed the dimsum here more than Golden Unicorn. They had more veggie options for sure. The veggie steamed dumplings were very good. Lots of carts going around and you basically pick whatever you like! The ladies seemed less rude/pushy than golden unicorn. Great variety of steamed and fried dimsum and also sweeter dimsum for dessert. There was even a whole cart just for cheong fun (steamed rice roll). Fresh &amp; good!There is a section in the middle of the restaurant where you can go up and get select dishes such as freshly pan-fried turnip pancake.The dimsum is priced by small, medium, large and there are higher prices for ""special"" items like seafood. The only thing is when you pick a dish you don't really know which pricing level it falls under, so it ended up that most of our dishes were medium/large and it added up quickly! Service is decent. They come around clearing your empty dimsum baskets/dishes quickly. It's not warm &amp; fuzzy if you are familiar with ""cart dimsum service"", but they do their job.In terms of wait time: when you get here they give you a number and the wait time was pretty short for 2 people. Went on a holiday (Labor Day) around noon, walked around for 20min and they actually already passed our number, so they let us go upstairs immediately. When you go upstairs you have to wait about an extra 5min to get seated. The restaurant is huge!! Turnover is fast and they are pretty efficient. Have not been on an actual weekend so I can't speak to that, but I have heard it is pretty busy on the weekends. So the earlier you go is probably better.  Overall I would definitely come back here for some yummy cart dimsum! Chinese friends recently invited us for dim sum here on a very busy Sunday. We had a wonderful time together in this huge and lively red and gold, old fashioned Chinese restaurant.Before this visit, I had not been here since I performed on the big stage for a very big Chinese event 3 or 4 years ago. I never really liked the food here, but the atmosphere was always festive and a lot of fun. With seating for 1,500, it used to take me a long time to get from one end of the restaurant to the other.This time, the dim sum was just OK but it didn't really matter since we were having so much fun.  Also, I was pleasantly shocked that the ladies bathroom had been updated and was actually clean. In past years, I always dreaded having to visit the bathroom in my long, tight-fitting 'qi pao' since the ladies room was so awful.I sincerely hope that the Jing Fong will survive the nearby gentrification since this place is such an important part of old Chinatown.",https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZiVVdTA5hl3s87igWe4TcA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/B_sq1ttbaStN7-EU8ORmnQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YTnTXqnXeJynh3eHb8bxFQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2p--r233Hq3o4Q4s2GpgYQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yiFmSZaqsmJcGcvc98PQ5A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lsvfkVf6s8-_1U8CTyLOZQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zgnXBDAKok0tyVzXnRzcAw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AEZ9FMz5tEP7e7YPRGd82w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/X6-Owrcp9GBNJJhJvRxJcQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lU1daFvEY45EtGasEJ0Iyg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9IHupLKgbtFd1EhgzLzEjQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZcAAwW7e2XqqvCdjPIlNvg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/St6H6tSfRVRf0RO6VkNuAQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/r53rFyEh_zKs3t1BKh5gZA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/aiKawQ501wB9pdkY6fie3A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2Nd1wXaEIHFZ8KBfMgVKYA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DXfydk51pgKhNiASY2mSEQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Xno3LkBmvowGx5NiOy8BiQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/iI97B6_Shs6Pd-10I169SQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2fEM52DWFpVYxXM908P0mw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nNkARQ9MLsr8eCtrsnUCYw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/iGvCDFF9yR7uw0Fv0SXx5w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7NXdTUaIrXBpsu_Rk37T_Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wjZOEaweLVIp4JY5gjqPsw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/O_2ga8CstLdyUUL7dGBJjA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MXJ-ktJO8LU9TUgTYG2NzA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nc9z9DTmJfFNPOPbeJ59rg/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/joes-shanghai-new-york-2,joes-shanghai-new-york-2,New York,10002,NY,Shanghainese,Seafood,Venues & Event Spaces,"Typical Chinese restaurant to me! I liked their XLB because it was bigger than the typical XLB from places like Din Tai Fung. Ordered pork XLB, crispy beef chow mein, and string beans. Overall, I think it's a good place for XLB and if you're a visitor of the city. Just one of those... Try it once since you're visiting kind of places. Price is always a bit above average because... New York. First things first, this is just average soup dumpling.I don't understand why people hype it so much, because to me, this is just a little better than the frozen soup dumpling.I got the scallion pancake, lo mein, and 2 stacks of soup dumplings. All tasted fine, but I guess I just have high expectations for the hyped restaurants where some places meet or exceed my expectation and some place just disappoints. And this would be one of the one that didn't meet my expectation. I grew up loving this place as THE place to get soup dumplings in NYC but I've back a few times in the past 6 months and was rather disappointed. Maybe the quality has gone down in the past few years? Or maybe I've just been spoiled rotten by the recent opening of other, better restaurants in Chinatown. When I go, I usually order the crab and pork soup dumpling and another dish of beef noodles. The beef noodles are an oily mess of flavorful thick noodles - so slimy yet satisfying. The soup dumplings come out piping hot but some of the soup dumplings didn't have SOUP which is strange for a place famous for its soup dumplings. For the 30min-1 hour wait, I expected better soup dumplings. Also note this place is cash only and it's mostly all communal seating, so you'll be sharing a table with other groups. This place also feels extremely touristy - there were few Asian people actually at the restaurant. I'm not sure if I'll be coming back because there are definitely better places for soup dumplings in Chinatown. If you like dumplings, this is the place for you!Beef noodles are great here also. This is a very popular restaurant for locals and I learned long ago to go where the locals go.It's a very affordable and clean eatery. I've been to the one in Flushing and quality and look of restaurant is the same. We arrived around 9:30 on. Monday night so it wasn't very busy but still a good amount of people - they sat us right away. We got the pork soup dumplings, chicken fried rice, and Shanghai noodle soup. Everything was fresh, came out very fast and was delicious. Can't wait to come back and try some other dishes! *CASH ONLY *Typically a 20 minute wait to eat at a shared tableAll you need to know about Joe's Shanghai is that they have the best XLB (soup dumplings) ever. I've had many in NYC and around the USA, but nothing compares to here. The amount of soup in one of their XLB is double the normal amount for only $6. I gotta give a shout out to their wine chicken ($8) as well, tender with a pronounced flavor.Meal Value (from 1-10, my measure of quantity/quality of the meal compared to price): 9The best soup dumplings at an affordable price - come eat here already! This place is way too packed and way too popular. Most of their customers are white so I don't mean to be racist or prejudice in any way but the food was very ""americanized."" My group of friends and I stayed in Manhattan by time square so it was quite the distance to get to China town. We were expecting some authentic chinese food.  Right when we showed up the lady host said ""our party was too big and told us to wait 30 minutes."" Cool, it's chinatown so lets do some sight-seeing. We walked around and when we came back, 30 minutes later, she said I cannot seat you guys until you're whole party is here. Mind you that the dining area is about 1000 square feet and I have a party of 14. We aren't just going to come into the restaurant and stand around until you have a table ready for us. So the stand-off began. Half of my party was standing in the door way and the other half was standing outside. The host finally took our word for it and gave us 2 tables. The tables are really cramped and each one can fit only 6 comfortably; we had 14.  Onto the food: it was pretty decent. Just very americanized. If you are wearing a white shirt or an expensive shirt i advise you to eat the dumplings VERY CAREFULLY. Once you bite into one of their dumplings the juices will squirt everywhere. Their calamari could use some better battering(it was way too light and bland) and no honey walnut shrimp?!?! I substituted it with salty pepper shrimp and they actually clean the spines out for you here which is really impressive. And our flounder was cut up and deboned for us without asking. The tables aren't so big either so we got our courses 2 entrees at a time. Nevertheless we were stuffed and content with our food choice. Great experience! You seat next to a bunch of friendly strangers  and start to order food. Dumplings are famous and delicious! We tried the ones with Pork! Overall great atmosphere and service! Food: it's good, not great.Service: leaves much to be desired. Our waiter walked away from us irritated and rolling his eyes after we ordered 2 orders of soup dumplings. We had to call him back to tell him we wanted to order more food. He must have thought we were lowly tourists coming to try a trendy spot. Also, I hate communal tables. I had to sit sideways in my chair to keep from staring at another couple across the table. We tried both the crab and pork XLB. I liked them both but didn't find the broth to be as savory and rich as some of the places in Jersey that I like. I have no doubt you could find yummier XLB in Chinatown. We also shared a tofu dish that my boyfriend loved but I found slightly too sweet. It was #100 on the menu. It was quite oily too. Every bite I took of tofu, a hot stream of water and grease poured down my chin and I felt the ghost of future zits forming in it's wake. Glad I tried it but wouldn't run back anytime soon. I came because my friend recommended this place to me. I was hoping for a great experience, but I left feeling a bit disappointed. Service was horrible, our server was rude and didn't help us with anything. It was also strange to be seated with other parties too instead of having our own table even though there were open tables around us. SHRIMP FRIED RICEThe flavor was so simple and basic. It definitely wasn't worth the price. There was way too much soy sauce in the rice and it was very salty. It definitely was lacking the authentic fried rice I was looking for. SAUTEED STRING BEAN- with minced porkThis was one of the better dishes. I really liked the crispness. It definitely added some textures to some of the other dishes. CRISPY PEPPER SKIN DUCKLINGI really disliked this dish. The skin was crisp, but salty. I didn't like the flavor and it was just too fried for my liking. The flavor didn't stand out in anyway other than the salt. It was very disappointing. CRAB MEAT WITH PORK MEAT SOUP DUMPLINGSIf I ate this dish alone, I would give this restaurant 5 stars. The dumplings were my favorite part of the meal. It was so sweet and moist. I really like the sweet broth inside the dumplings. I've tried other places that have tried this, but have failed. If I ever come back, it will only be to order this and this alone.I most likely won't be coming back. The service and food are disappointing. I did like their staple soup dumpling dish, but I don't know if it's worth the whole experience. The food here is flavorful and comes out fast, but the service is lacking. While we were starting to get up they already seated people at our table so we trapped against the wall. We then were repeatedly bumped towards the door even though we didn't have our coats on. That being said, we didn't have to wait and were seated as a party of 5 at a shared table immediately at 11:30. We ordered Scallion Pancake, Pork Soup Dumplings, Crispy Shredded Beef, Eggplant, Green Beans, and Shanghai Noodles with chicken. The tea was hot and refilled quickly. The table was set with a soup spoon and small dishes of vinegar waiting for our first order of dumplings.The beef was sweet and crispy but not chewy like other versions of this dish I've had. What I thought were shredded carrots were bitter pieces or orange peel mixed into the dish. The eggplant had a crisp, blistered skin which yielded to a squishy center but it needed flavor. It tasted solely of the oil it was fried in. Green beans were salty with firm wrinkly skins that snapped with each bite. The Shanghai noodles were almost the size of udon noodles and were very comforting and familiar in a slightly sweet brown gravy sauce.But the star here is the XLB. The soup dumplings, when plucked from the steamer (I used my fingers since the tongs are more risky) had the perfect mouthful of soup. The broth was flavorful and the dumpling wrapper wasn't too thick. The meat inside was actual dumpling filling, not mystery meat that I've seen ooze out of other dumplings.Cash only, but not that expensive! There's an ATM right when you walk in. We hear that the place gets pack quick, so we arrived before they were even open!  We stood in the cold weather for some good xao long bao!  The place did get pack quick when they opened though, so come early!  The service was fairly fast, we had the following:Pork soup dumplings - steamy hot porky, rich soup with a splash of vinegary soy.. yumPork and crab soup dumplings - almost the same, with just a hint of crab, delicious stillBe careful when biting into it, I was overexcited and ended up burning myself.. but so good!! Came here to try their ever so popular soup dumplings and now I'm wondering if there's any possible way I can get them shipped to me in Houston. These soup dumplings definitely live up to all the hype. They have the most delicious broth inside that just burst into your mouth when you take a bite.. it's dumpling heaven. Other than the crab and pork soup dumplings, we ordered the Shanghai noodles and scallion pancake. Both were delicious. The noddles were a little on the oiler side but oiler the tastier right ? There was also complimentary tea wish was perfect for the weather outside. At the end of the meal, they give you sliced oranges and a wet towel which is super nice. Something that I found funny is that once we sat down, our waiter came to us and asked ""do you want soup dumplings ?"" Instead of the typical, ""what would you like to drink ?"" It's like they know what everyone comes here for !! Tips for if you're wanting to have the amazing experience of Joe's Shanghai soup dumplings: don't go on the weekend if you're not willing to wait hours and BRING CASH. Honestly, I feel like this place is waaaaaay too overrated. It's a busy restaurant. However, tho there's always a wait, the rotations are pretty quick so most likely you'll get in faster than you expected. Joes Shanghai have their customers share tables with other customers. Meaning you'll be seating with other parties, which may be but awkward. Because the restaurant is so busy, the customer service is..... nonexistent. The only things that the staff members will do is quickly take your orders, give your foods, and give you your bill. No ones rude, But no one is friendly and nice.The foods other than their dumplings are... pretty gross...my table ordered the famous soup dumpling, green bean, sweet and sour soup, and orange chicken. I'm not going to lie. The foods (minus the soup dumpling) was gross..... the green bean was dumped in oil, wasn't seasoned properly, and tasted awful. On the other side, the soup was seasoned very heavily and I felt like I was eating a salt soup. Additionally, the plates were nasty. Which was very unpleasant. Though the soup dumpling was great, flavorful and cheap, I didn't have the most exciting experience Heard all about this place for the longest time, and i finally got to try this myself. It definitely lives up to the hype, not like any other shao long bow I've tried. Filled with so much flavorful broth, the meat itself was so tender and delicious. It's definitely a little gem and somethjng you must try when visiting NY. The Soup Dumplings were Amazing! Totally loved them!It was definitely worth the trip downtown. Although it was very crowded, we didn't have to wait long to be seated. I guess the table-sharing is the reason behind that. We even shared some food with our new table buddies. Not the soup dumplings though, obviously. . . to good to share with anyone actually ;-)We had ordered some Chinese greens as a side-dish and they did as well, so that was good to share. Greens and dumplings are a good combo and all in all we were pretty full, ordering two sets of dumplings for two was more than enough, leaving you satisfied and not craving desert afterwards. We got here around 3:30 and there was already a wait.  You get a number from the hostess and you wait until she calls your number.  We waited about 20 mins.  Once seated you will be sitting at a table with other patrons. It's definitely a little awkward but after a while you don't even notice the people at the table because you're busy eating.We ordered the pork dumplings and crab dumplings. Both were just ok.  The soup seeped out of the dumplings and the skin was a little thick on some.We also ordered scallion pancakes which were very delish. TRY THESE DUMPLINGS! The best soup dumplings I've ever had in my entire life. You have to try these. Seriously, stop in and get the soup dumplings. I liked the pork more than the crab, but that may be a personal preference in meat.Still dreaming about these dumplings. Pretty big juicy dumplings with lots of meat. You have to the patient picking them up without breaking them and wasting the soup. The skin is a bit thicker than some of these other ones I've been to.There were only three of us and we had three orders of pork and one order of crab.Tip: come before 11:15am to be seated without wait. After that, you will always see a long line outside the restaurant. I realize I may be Yelp crucified once the soup dumpling experts get ahold of this review...I've had better. They were good, but I've had better.....(luv u Nom Wah) Pork dumplings 8 for $9, good broth but a little more fatty than I would've liked. (Pork and the pork with crab combo are the only dumpling fillings available). My boyfriend had white fish in white wine sauce with fungi and a side of steamed white rice. (See pic) Simple but delicious. I really appreciate the ambiance here. Kinda feels like someone's dining room. Home-y, family style and you even sit with strangers if there aren't enough of you for a large table. My boyfriend and I sat with 4 men who were already well into their meal. To our surprise, not awkward. Everybody just rolls with it. Complimentary tea throughout your meal (loved it, next time I'll ask what kind it is) and orange slices at the end of your meal. It was pretty good. Not spectacular as it is painted but solid. Give them a try. I'll return for other stuff &amp; report back! Oh!

https://www.yelp.com//biz/juicy-spot-cafe-new-york,juicy-spot-cafe-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Juice Bars & Smoothies,Coffee & Tea,Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt,"We wanted some dessert and the rolled ice cream really hit the spot. We got the green tea oreo and it was delish! Could taste both the flavours. They take a little while to make because they literally roll it fresh in front of you. Ive seen it in thailand, so it's cool to have it also in LES. Good selection of smoothies, juices and aa bowls which are made fresh and to order. I got the green aa bowl which has kale and spinach added for some extra greens-- can't taste it at all if you're afraid it might be bitter. I really enjoyed my bowls which was very filling and can be eaten as a meal if you are not super hungry! The other bowls are mostly fruit based. They have lots of healthy toppings like almonds, walnuts, goji berries as well. Note- the granola has honey and isn't vegan. For more desserty items, they have thai ice cream rolls that are customizable, waffles and bubble tea but I didn't try any of those. For food they have avocado toast, nut butter toast and now salads too! Not much seating, small store with no bathroom. Overall a nice spot in LES for a healthy boost of fruit! Literally stumbled here earlier today. I love juices but this place has a lot more to offer.It's clean, quaint and cute with several tables available for eating/drinking in.Although I only ordered a juice (the wake up call made with carrots apple, lemon and ginger), they also serve ice cream rolls ( not sure what it is but the picture resembles an actual roll and apparently you can make your own &amp; add toppings), smoothies, shakes, juices, bowls, salads and various beverages (teas/lattes). Prices seemed standard/reasonable. Juices were 3 sizes: 12 ounces at $5.95, 16 ounces at $6.95 and 20 ounces which was $7.95.I enjoyed my juice &amp;  pitstop at Juicy Spot. I've tried pretty much every flavor at this place and none of them disappoint. The toppings and the ice-cream flavors complement each other, making a perfect end-product. You can't go wrong with any flavor, but my favorites are below:Unique Dragon: Yogurt base with dragon fruit, topped with dragon fruit, strawberries, dark chocolate shavings, and chocolate drizzle. Love the rich color of dragon fruit and the chocolate drizzle.Ferre-Roll Rocher: Base with nutella, topped with crushed wafers, chopped hazelnuts, and nutella drizzle. Anything made of nutella can't be wrong, no?Watermelon Lychee:  Lychee base, topped with watermelon, granola, mochi, and condensed milk drizzle. I am biased 'cos lychee is my absolute fav fruit.I also love how this place is not as crowded as similar Chinatown joints. That's probably why Leonardo Di Caprio snuck into this place to satiate his ice-cream cravings! Yes, they have a picture of him on the bulletin board. Yelp checkin gives you a free topping! Pretty decent place with rolled Thai ice cream, smoothies, fresh juices and drinks folled with boba/tapioca, or flavored jellies. I had a Spring fling (1/2 sugar) and it was pretty good.  Green tea with strawberry and lychee jellies and puree.  The prices a tad more than other shops, but I suppose location has a lot to do with that. I would come back to try some of the rolled ice cream. I like that this place serves both healthy and unhealthy items. There's something for everyone! I chose unhealthy when I stopped by though ;) I got the Ferrero Rocher ice cream rolls. Service was fairly prompt. There was nobody else in the cafe that afternoon so there was plenty of seating. They do have a bench outside, as well, which is nice. The ice cream was really good and I liked the presentation, too. I would come back here to try more but maybe an acai bowl next time, since there are so many ice cream roll places to try in the area. It was right besides our dorm and I always went here for ice cream rolls!! I loved everything with yogurt base and chocolate base in some flavors. I really enjoyed all the flavors I had! It is a thai ice cream roll spot that also has acai bowls. I tried the ""Acai"": Aai blended with banana and apple juice and topped with strawberries, mangoes, banana, granola, and chia seeds. Every ingredient is fresh and solid. The granola has a good crunch to it. It feels slightly smaller than I accustomed to. The $8 price is in line with other spots in New York. If you want to torture yourself, eat an acai bowl in the shop as you watch other patrons eat thai ice cream rolls. I have not tried them at Juicy Spot but they look so good.If you are looking for recommendations for good acai bowls in New York, feel free to message me through Yelp and I can share my personal list of acai bowls in the city, which includes my Yelp reviews. The information for an electronic copy can also be found via my Yelp profile. I tried rolled ice cream for the first time here. I had heard that rolled ice cream wasn't worth all the hype, so I didn't have extremely high expectations (I was mostly just curious). After trying it, I can say that I really enjoyed the rolled ice cream here! My sister and I shared two things: 1) the watermelon lychee and 2) a make-your-own with green tea ice cream, strawberry flavor, mango topping, and condensed milk drizzle. I liked being able to watch the employees make the rolled ice cream. It was definitely a plus for my experience. There were three female employees working, and they were all really efficient. For the green tea ice cream with strawberry flavor, they pour the ice cream (which is liquidy at first) onto this thing which is like the cold version of a stove, and they mix/chop up strawberries in with the ice cream. Once that's all done, they flatten out the ice cream and then roll it up. It was cool to watch!The watermelon lychee consists of ""original"" ice cream with lychee mixed in, topped with watermelon, granola, and condensed milk drizzle. It was sweet, a little tart, and perfect for summer. The green tea ice cream with strawberry flavor was a good balance, since it wasn't as sweet but had some different flavors than the watermelon lychee. Overall, I really enjoyed the whole experience of watching my rolled ice cream being made and eating it (it's definitely different than eating a normal scoop of ice cream). I see why rolled ice cream is a thing, and now I want to try more of it! I ordered the ""sunshine"" juice, it's grapefruit, Apple and lemon, I got my vitamin boost. Very happy, it is very sweet though. Didn't get free ice cream topping after checking in, because I didn't order ice cream. We love their thai ice cream. Got to create our own. Definitely go back when the weather warmer with my kids. Juicy spot is on the money, the creative possibilities are endless with this ice cream. The staff is super friendly and helpful. When I walking in, I thought ""well just another place where you can get rolled ""Thai"" ice cream"". But it definitely turned out to be quite different. I came during Juicy Spots anniversary when they were giving out as many free toppings (so added stars for that). Price was pretty justifiable. Adding the concentrated milk reminded me of my childhood which was great! My friends and I had a late dinner in Lower Manhattan and were looking for something refreshing to end our night with. We found Juicy Spot Cafe a short walk from where we were and decided to try it given the 4.5 star rating. It is a block from the Delancy St station (F train) and a couple of blocks from the Essex St station (JMZ trains) - very convenient.This is a small store with 3 or 4 tables in total. It has every healthy option you could ever want: thai ice cream rolls (yes, ice cream is healthy), smoothies, acai bowls and salads. There are a lot more options for flavors in store than what you see on their menu online and there is also an option to create your own smoothies/bowls/drinks/ice cream rolls. I made my own large  smoothie ($6.95) and added the maximum four flavors. My friend got the Super Acai Bowl ($10) which she loved (tastes like a smoothie) and the Hangover smoothie ($5.95) which was also very yummy. Overall, I would recommend this store if you are craving a yummy drink. If you are looking to try the acai bowls then you also won't be disappointed. I will be returning the next time I'm in the area to try other flavors and their Thai ice cream rolls. Don't forget - if you check-in on Yelp you can get 1 free topping! I miss this place so much!!!!The best dragon fruit ice cream with unlimited toppings.It was so hot and beyond perfect for the weather. I wish I didn't have to share with the BF. AhahahOpen one in the LA. Please!!!!! Better than some of the other rolled ice places I've tried. I split the raspberry combo and it was enough for two people, which is great because this stuff is pretty pricey. Worth it for the experience of watching them make it! If you like to live on the healthy side, this is another Juice spot I would highly recommend.Look for LIN, she is awesome and knows how to make everything healthy taste good :pI love the Ginger Lover Fresh Juice, it's also the most popular juice there ...Enjoy Only been here once but I would say it's definitely worth a try. It's such a unique experience to watch them make the ice cream and it sure is tasty Came across their 'off the menu' ice cream roll combo called Double Fun in the Sun, which is a combination of mango and dragon fruit ice cream, and decided to give it a try since I'd been hearing rave reviews about Juicy Spot ever since the ice cream roll craze hit NYC. Unfortunately, neither the experience nor the ice cream really delivered.  I'm not sure if it is due to inexperience,  inefficiency, or the fact that they only have two ice cream slabs to work with, but the employees were realllyyyy slowww. I think we waited half an hour or more for one cup of ice cream!!! I'd definitely recommend coming at an off hour if you don't have that much time to kill. The ice cream roll was super cute and totally Instagram worthy, but it was also super bland. It was neither sweet nor tart... It really didn't taste like anything, tbh. We decided that we couldn't really taste the mango or the dragonfruit because both were overpowered by the milky taste of the base. I checked in too late on Yelp to discover that we could have added a free topping - which might have helped with the lack of flavor - but overall I was pretty disappointed with the taste of the dessert. Also, there is an $8 credit card minimum, which is super annoying because all ice cream rolls are $6, so you kind of have to order something else... We ended up trying the hangover smoothie, which was super healthy tasting but not really my cup of tea. However, my friend really enjoyed it! Riding the rolled ice cream wave in NYC...The ones I tried:- Unique Dragon: I thought this would be my favorite, but the dragon fruit yogurt base actually didn't stand out among the other flavors. It sure is beautiful though! - Good Crazy Matcha: my favorite of the night. The green tea base had an ever so slightly bitter flavor that I always look for, and the lychee, whiled canned, went very well with it. - Black Sesame: the black sesame base was very good, the mochi added some nice chewiness. Good service. Reasonable lines. The only suggestion I have is to lower the AC because we all froze off our rears in there.",https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tLgYILzI_ktIDtH2lixN9A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ji01_5PuevF61cVjq1jQwA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/sGhi1Uh7qDEomntEILkMSw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/g1J_4b8yWLt17LtZmRtZgQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oWUqpXAGnUmZjhTkHuMgug/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yb3O_FEh-606fgVtgHDINQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YOos92X9WyVxnVe7ktxggA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/07syNZgACqkflNJjgxZLyw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EpMsfOyyPB5dJoq_UmnbqA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/m45plSQvIe4yxCrdBttl4Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KZX-V1c2W4kXU1l_H-pHVQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LeJiL0ti86dWh4IatvC_CQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vyAEfyJZ-14vUPHINe3cLg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/z5EgQ-HlpMvklsfj1j4fdw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/X7VbSlqKe05k7B-r1rglXA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/B9m87DQFs0EvEpg61Lw6YQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xzPc6kS7UJi3huMQk88KJA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0IG39SR-UTsw8ukNwF_frg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/u2VoxUbbX7f9_WK5HK6W1w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fEOfmMc8SvgVfrUsqEoZQw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rbXStRkczLa0-ItqmCyGiA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/D27MnngL19QlJiMfXzIV2Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1SkWOpGio6qNlpZQVrzgbw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KmKK9lKbvBtnaZV14zxpDw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DToDx6WyjHkh6i5CVi7FoA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PMr9er_I_zGPVy-g5Gx6lw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5SriGAI7hQhI7KI5Swbb_A/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/kam-hing-coffee-shop-new-york-2,kam-hing-coffee-shop-new-york-2,New York,10002,NY,Bakeries,Coffee & Tea,NA,"The sponge cakes are so light and airy!! Minimum of $15 on credit cards so be prepared to bring cash. They're super efficient and you should be prepared to order when you get up front. Regular sponge is $0.75 and all other flavors $1.25. You can also buy a dozen per box. Seating is available but generally you'll find lots of Asian families sitting and enjoying their sponge cakes and coffee/tea. They also have other savory/more entree like options but didn't try. TLDR; get the sponge cakes (all flavors) and be ready to order. They're super cheap. Price/taste is high value $0.75 for an original sponge cake that is AMAZING!! It might seem small when u get it but its an e x p e r i e n c e. Its not overwhelmingly sweet and its inner part is moist and wonderful. Pairs well with a cup of hot milk tea. Their green tea flavored spongecake is also delicious with obvious hints of matcha. Ive had their fishballs once too and they were hot and uber flavorful. Their Vietnamese iced coffee tastes concentrated and sweet, as well.There is some seating inside, and there are a bunch of old people. To discourage people from staying too long there is a 15 minute sitting limit. Love this place, and I will continue to buy their spongecakes forever. My friend was like WE HAVE TO GO, THE COFFEE SHOP WILL CLOSE, and I was like, I'M KAMHING, I'M KAMHING.And I came so fast, that we went all the way. To Kam Hing, in about 15 minutes.I'm not a fan of the famous coconut Tarts at all but the little doughy bread with the chocolate chips in it is wonderful. Really underrated actually. So it's all about the little sponge cake desserts. A lot of people said oh it's just like Wonder Bread well no it's really not. Maybe you don't have very developed taste buds, but the stuff is actually unique and delicious and made with a lot of love. The lovely young man who was friendly AF recommended that I try the legendary chocolate chip. There are many different flavors, but the chocolate chip is really the way to go. Definitely one of my favorite little secret treats in Chinatown and extremely unique. If there were 6 available, it would get 6 Stars. Hipsters need not apply.I'm not sure if them getting 4-and-a-half stars ""Hing""-es on my rating, but in my opinion, this place should have 1,000 5-star reviews. The new owners took the original sponge cakes and gave it faces.  Love the caricatures in the store.  They expanded the flavor options with chocolate, green tea and whatever they can think of. I tend to stick with the original flavor.  Their sponge cake is super moist and flavorful.  It stays pretty fresh for up to 5 days (never pushed it further than that).  Not sure if you want to either.They also added steamed rice noodles and curry fish balls.  Tried both and surprisingly they were both AMAZING. Looking forward to what they will spin out of their kitchen in the near future. BEST SPONGE CAKES in the area and for a good reason. If there's anything you need to try from Chinatown, this is it.You won't be able to find another place that makes them like Kam Hing does. My favorite is their original - for $0.75 each expect a light fluffy moist melt in your mouth buttery subtly sweet sponge cake. I'm happy to say that although they have expanded throughout the years, the sponge cakes remain affordable and their quality and flavor hasn't changed except for the additions of new flavors.PS. Be sure to buy a few when you're here cause you won't be able to stop yourself after eating just one! Come here for their signature sponge cakes as the reviews are true.  Incredible delicious.  Must try! Soft, flaky, moist, slightly sweet, fluffy, good snack size, and good price for one piece original flavor $.75.  It is best to consume the sponge cake while still hot as it is fresh.  Flavor sponge cakes are priced slightly higher.  Original is always indelible.  In 2017 ailing economy what can you purchase under $1 especially in NYC (aside from Lucy Van Pelt's psychiatric help for $.05)? Four stars due to filthy tables from residue of previous patrons who do not clean after themselves.  Staff does not clean the tables.  Interior appears very outdated dating back to early 1980's or possibly earlier.  Occupying the tables is a fifteen (15) minute time limit.  There is also a minimum of $15 for credit card, ergo I suggest come with plenty of cash.  Pending the time of the day families are occupying the space while children are running amok screaming boisterously loud while the elderly are sipping tea and enjoying a sponge cake in silence and solitude.  Gimme sponge cake!!Kam Hing's sponge cake has surely peaked my interest. There isn't alot of things that can be bought for less than $1 in NYC. I'm glad Kam Hing's sponge cake is one of those few things. Their original sponge cake is 75 cent (only!) . It is a less sweet, more substantial version of an angel food cake. Pairs especially well with a milk tea or coffee.I came here on a Sunday afternoon and had to wait in line for 10 minutes before I can get my hands on their famous sponge cakes, While in line, I was able to peek into their kitchen where I saw their bakers moving trays of freshly baked sponge cakes. So glad to know that I'm getting freshly baked cakes and not stale ones that have been sitting on a bakery case for days. This place is still my favorite for a couple of sponge cakes whenever I'm in the area. This little shop is VERY casual and Chinese. What I mean by that is since it's family owned, you will see their kids' toys and a table or two on the side where they put their belongings. At times, it's a super loud environment with kids yelling and playing and grandparents chatting away. I usually just grab and go (real fast). Besides the sponge cakes, I have not tried anything else but they have a lot of coffee selections and they also sell fish balls - good for quick lunch. The sponge cakes are $1 each, $1.25 for flavored ones. I would stick with the original because sometimes the other flavor takes a bit away the fluffiness. For example, the coconut actually has coconut pieces so the texture is not as good. However, green tea flavored is worth a try. DELICIOUS SPONGE CAKES.  Been coming here for 2 decades.  Sponge cakes are made fresh daily.  So soft and delicious.  Their original flavor is the best.  The green tea flavor sponge cakes are a little dry.  Cash only.  One time I had to stop my mother from bringing a suitcase to load it up with sponge cakes. I always buy 3-4 dozen sponge cakes when I travel to New York.    I think I'll have to buy 2 dozen in the future to cut down carbs in my diet. BEST. SPONGE. CAKES. There. I said it. Soft, fluffy, MOIST, slightly sweet, and the perfect size! I always take at least 2 dozen back to Boston. I've never tried the other flavors because the original is so good. When I walked into Kam Hing, I immediately understood why it's a neighborhood favorite. Its sponge cakes definitely live up to the hype. Its vibe is a throwback to the 1990s, (of course) an era where none of us were walking down city sidewalks while looking at our smartphones. For 75 cents, the original flavored sponge cake is one you can't go wrong with. Like many other commenters mention, its subtly sweet taste and moist texture make the sponge cake decadent without weighing you down after you consume it, since this treat isn't dense.As I mentioned in my tip, the Kam Hing staff stopped making toilet paper available in its bathrooms, because people kept on stealing them. The chalkboard menu, kitschy / humorous signs and cash only policy give this spot its charm. I hope Kam Hing stays in business for a long time. Hole in the wall place. This coffee shop is known for their sponge cake. It says so outside!I was eating at Taiyaki and saw the yellow sign that said ""best sponge cake in town"" so i immediately ran inside! Their regular sponge cakes are 75 cents each, sort of tiny looking. The flavored ones cost more. There are a lot of really funny signs around the front counter.I was surprised to see that the Chinese workers there were not only really fluent in English, but also talking to each other in English! There is a huge flat screen TV in the eating area as well as a lot of chairs. There are a few game machines, but they are all not plugged in. This seems to be the place that all locals know about. I saw a business man all suited up come in and buying a spongecake and coffee to quickly scarf down. Boy, i've been missing out all these years! The spongecake was so light and fluffy. Not too sweet. Milk tea here is also very good. It was a little stuffy in here because the air conditioning wasn't on. But maybe that's just to make customers not linger around too long. The food here was great! I've been coming here for 4+ years. They have THE best sponge cakes in all of NYC. I don't know how they make it but it's so moist and fluffy. Personally I love the original, the other flavors are good too.They also sell chinese rice cake rolls with fish balls. The rice rolls are pretty good, it's mad cheap. The fish cakes are not that great but it's dirt cheap. The service is super fast and some of the people working at the register are hispanic but they understand Chinese. I was so impressed! AND they are SUPER friendly, even to all the chinese grandpas and grandmas who can come off very rude. Nice airy and light sponge cakes that are inexpensive. Perfect for a mid day snack with tea or coffee. $0.75 for the original and $1.25 for flavors. Definitely get the original and one of the flavors when you're here. I've come here twice and both times the green tea sponge cake ran out! Luckily the guy at the counter said I can call to have them hold my order for pick up! Conveniently located right off Canal Street. It's a bit tricky to find but just look out for the sponge cake flag hanging above the building. Will have to come here again to taste the green tea sponge cake! What you need to know: - this is THEE place to get sponge cakes, it is their specialty!- there is a small seating area for when you can't wait to grub on the sponge cakes- these cakes are so special that I bring them as gifts from NYC all the time! - cash only! What I always get:- the original flavor $0.75 remains the best! There are other flavors such as chocolate chip, green tea, cappuccino, strawberry, butter scotch, etc that cost $1.25. - ask them if you can get fresh and hot sponge cakes and it is seriously 5 times better! Normally, biting into the sponge cake feels like eating a fluffy cloud. If you are lucky enough to get them hot, it's seriously heaven!!! Love this place!!! Their little sponge cakes!! Drooooolllll I've been coming here for those cakes for years!!! They've been a hole in the wall for way too long. Glad they were able to expand to such a larger place! Their cakes are still great. There's a new flavor they have. Already forgot what it is cuz I only wanted the original. Sorry!!! But a box of 12 is $9 right now. Not a bad price. There have lots of tables and chairs if you wanted to eat cake and have coffee. They sell other little things too. They have a bathroom for customers. Love this place!!!!! The people are super nice! They speak cantonese. =D Browsing through Yelp, this store intrigued me all the raves that this is the place to get sponge cakes.  I'm down for the best of anything especially if it cost about a dollar.I found the store's decor amusing.  I'm sure they didn't hire a decorator, but the owner probably found some signs that amused him and throws it up around the store.  I would describe the place as whimsical and they some signs that did make me smile.I went during a slow period and there was no lines, but all the seats were taken. Luckily the sponge cakes are perfect for the road.   I got the original flavor and the green tea flavor.  Both were about the same size.  Small.  I think 3 bites is all it takes to make it disappear, but I ate it slowly so I could actually taste it.  These sponge cakes are a bit denser than what I had in other bakeries, but it had good flavor.  The original is very buttery and the green tea had enough flavor to make you know what it was.  I personally would have liked the green tea taste to be more intense, but it was good enough. The original was 75c and the flavored ones were $1.25.  Is the flavored ones worth 67% more than the original?  Apparently so, since that's the market rate.Having different flavors sponge cakes is what makes this place unique and special and it's enough for me to try the rest of their flavors in due time. The significant other was so giddy when his friend showed him this place. For a $1.50, you can get a small cold drink. This really made his day since we were walking around and being tired tourists. I ordered the milk tea while he ordered the coffee/tea mix. While our drinks went commando, without tapioca pearls, it was pretty good... His and mine only varied in the very sight hint of coffee. Seating space was rare as we encountered a large group of elderly Chinese sitting around chatting. There's a bathroom here that's open to patrons of the place. It didn't have a lock or door code so I saw one or two folks sneaking in and using it. A random outpour of rain led me and a friend here, and what a pleasant surprise! This cafe specializes in traditional Chinese paper wrapped sponge cakes, which are deliciously light and pillowy cakes typically eaten for breakfast or afternoon tea. This coffee shop even offers fun novelty flavors like strawberry, cinnamon, chocolate, and matcha, and most (unfortunately for me) were sold out by the time I came in around 4pm. I tried the strawberry and the original, and both were excellent - fluffy, moist, and subtly sweet, just how I like them.There's minimal signage outside but no signs on the door itself. I actually had no idea what this cafe served until an employee welcomed us to come in, reassured us not to be afraid of all the elderly folks in there (lol), and explained that this little coffee shop specializes in Chinese sponge cakes. They definitely take pride in their work here, and even let us try a small sample before buying. So sweet of them.Bring cash because it's cash only, and come before 3pm to try one of their hot sponge cakes fresh out of the oven! I heard this coffee shop is famous for their sponge cakes. I was thinking ""Really? Just sponge cakes?"" But then again, some people call it ""legendary"" sponge cakes. I am completely down for legendary sponge cakes! So off we went. It is a bit of hall in a wall type of place, you will miss it if you are not paying attention. The inside was small, plain, simple, no-frills. They do offer more than the legendary sponge cakes, like hot dishes and other baked goods, and coffee &amp; tea of course. The infamous sponge cakes are in a plastic bin right underneath the cash register counter. They have the ""Original"" and few other flavored kinds. I hear the sponge cakes here are really popular, and that they get sold out quickly. We went there on a very snowy day, so we didn't have any issue getting what we wanted. It is always good to visit popular spot on a bad weather day. We got original, mint chocolate chip, and green tea sponge cake. They were really fluffy and airy, just as it was described by many of their fans. It was egg-y, sweet but not much, really light. As light as clouds. It is a simple sponge cake, but has that comfort flavor that reminds me of home-cooked or -baked feel to it. I see why their sponge cakes are popular. Very fluffy and light, and the flavored kinds have really strong flavors present in it. And the price, you can't beat the value. Super cheap!",https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/L2ZWnXMaEv3MW80pX5PQZQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/i0C3XDz2yTKkwcM_d0n_Ww/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dnPn3FFrM_lG28zl9fLbGA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MNPpaRngyU8BtLKmyPbUlw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LeP9l-0PvRJlFvNfeeFR0w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GQu5H8qy7KWywOTYTf97SA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_fDzfAvBVg5dGPc5CWsayg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MoVrxhNjvQXkDejJ7JGt2w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PBgrUc7cEOreomWBdVMc5A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DoEZx1_J94zzM4ycrTFRig/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/y-eS9nQAiyaG5iazCluubQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FtX9e7z_W6GLO3ZEO5Bo3Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CjvF_ZqmNEo4P4mF6FN1vw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rrYcg6fsYNja7r5FVwYZXg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QgBt0rIhLNUazcMQPDM4RQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/m8KxWd2AGeVICE893XOcpA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gYXbeGUNr7hczXOznRHTdw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dZEdmHqAlu5z4VoGcdK8Vw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-TpZEn_j8kkT9ZNa1arkmA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-eJYeiqMEg48M34IVWO95A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ncuH6KxrtBcc8mxu7kaZww/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Liso2_8yrPKhjzBM36zvuw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/eQ8bkNYGMiwJc8Cy6TOKXg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Ql3FRtvL58PELfsRv8AgMw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/K-SUtqFhFWfR-MsfeOGHTg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tgFMAAC1Z0EVtAVCwYHN9g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/933Ofzvf5N6AzhtQYcQKnA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yEDkalEWpI0K9gFNMbHkeQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5ewpfHfWIfjJrH9Lcw_DAQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Mr7tHYrh1cVLYPIANTzEYQ/258s.jpg
https://www.yelp.com//biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york,katzs-delicatessen-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Delis,Sandwiches,NA,"Honestly, this review can be summed up as so: It was a good pastrami sandwich, but not a $20 sandwich.On a Sunday night, we had no problem getting in and out quickly, which was a surprise since so many reviews mention long waits and crowds. We were able to walk right up to a counter and order. The seats were all full (I believe this may be for waiter service), but we just ate at a counter. We paid at the front when returning our ticket, but I think you can pay by card towards the back.Make sure to keep your ticket because you need it to get out even if you did not order anything. TLDR: While a bit pricey and very busy during peak hours, there's no denying that Katz can make a great sandwich.As annoying as it may be for the New Yorker, a good reason to come to New York is for the food. NYC has quite a few different types of food associated with the city, such as pizza and bagels, but don't forget the pastrami sandwich.While I am sure there are no shortage of delis in NYC, I would come to Katz at least once in your life to experience one of their pastrami on rye sandwiches. Yes, it could definitely be a tourist trap here, and there are plenty of pictures and videos of the lines during peak hours, but the sandwiches live up the hype.If you're coming to the lower east side for a sandwich at Katz, it seems like mid morning would be your best bet to avoid the rush. I did not want to waste an hour or so of my day just waiting in line during lunch, and if you come in the morning, there is literally no wait. When you enter, you immediately get a ticket from a staff member up front. Even if you're sharing a sandwich with someone else, both people will need a ticket. I think this helps them with monitoring who comes in and out, as well as what you order, but if you lose the ticket, you'll be charged $50 on your way out. And by the way, this place is cash only. There a number of staff to order your food from and once your order, and they'll even give you a sample of the meat your choose. If you never have had a sandwich from here before, it's probably best to go with the pastrami on rye as that's probably their most well known sandwich. If you want something different, I think that their corned beef is also a Katz staple.Their sandwiches are absolutely gigantic - a half of a Katz sandwich is a sufficient meal for just about anybody. They do not hold back on the amount of meat you get on your sandwich, so you should not be leaving this place hungry.While it is a bit pricey at around $20 a sandwich, I would say it definitely is worth it and will be one of the more memorable sandwiches you'll ever have. All I have to say is whenever I am sick or a friend is sick, I have Marco ball soup delivered to them from Katz's deli. They will deliver all over Manhattan (can be pricey) but it is so worth it. If you love a good bowl of soup and great sandwiches, Katzen is the place.Their knishes are also delish. Very large and heavy, but if you want some comfort food, it's a perfect go to. After coming here for 4 straight years. The quality hasn't changed. Make sure you tip well and chose a deli guy with a heavy hand :)I've only gotten the pastrami but why waste your time on anything else? Always a long line but always worth the wait! Love you Katz Deli!!! Ended up here on an impromptu sandwich run after 3 hours of statistics hungry and with a headache. So glad I did! I usually steer clear of the ""touristy"" places but damn that roast beef and matzo ball soup hit the spot! My classmate had a pastrami and corned beef mix. Party in our mouths! Katz's Delicatessen is a true landmark in the New York restaurant scene and it fully embodies all qualities that New York represents: A no-frill, eat-and-get out kind of New York deli that's open late (or 24-hours on weekends) to serve this city that never sleeps.There are many signature dishes at this historical restaurant, with the pastrami being the star of the show. I am personally an advocate for the Reuben Hot Sandwich with pastrami because I appreciate a bit more condiments and toppings on my pastrami sandwich than just mustard - tradition or not (Yes, I said it. What are you going to do? Arrest me?) With that said, if you are a purist, then you may opt to order the Katz's Pastrami Hot Sandwich or the platter.Another popular dish is the Matzo Ball Soup. I wouldn't say it's absolutely the best, as I find the broth slightly salty and lacking depth. But the matzo ball itself is fluffy and light. Among the side items, I am a big fan of the Square Potato Knish. Deep-fried to perfection, these crispy potato treats are a must-have for potato lovers.Due to their fame and popularity, Katz's tends to be a bit touristy and typically busy at all hours of the day. Like many reviews mentioned, the attendant will give you a ticket upon entering the restaurant. Whether you use it or not, hold on to it with your dear life. It's been a few years since I've been back here, and it's still one of the best pastrami sandwiches I've eaten! We went on a Monday afternoon, 1pm, light lines and fast service. Walk up to any of the available counters, order your food, they give you a sample taste of the meat, they hand carve the meat to make your sandwich, slice some pickles on there, then you give them your ticket you received when you walked in. Don't lose that ticket!!! It has the total price of what you ordered.The pastrami was part lean and part fatty, and the deli mustard was perfect! Also, share the sandwich if possible... it's huge!! We went really early, so there were no line.  When you walk through the door, you are given a ticket for each person.  Make sure you don't lose your ticket, you will be charged if so!  We decided that we were going to split a pastrami sandwich, so that we do not over eat, since we plan on eating another place after this.  We walked up to a craver and was very excited, he cut us a piece of pastrami, and boy, was it delicious!We ate our huge delicious pastrami sandwich, and was contemplating on ordering another, since we shared one.. but we had to resist!  We was going to make a trip back to Katz while we were in NYC, but failed to do so... so I shall visit the establishment again! PROS:- I mean, this place is famous for a reason. You get to experience what Harry felt like when he met Sally ;) CONS:- So so so crowded. Honestly, this place is so hectic. It's expected from some place as famous as this but it still takes you out of an enjoyable experience when you feel like you're being rushed and everything is crazy.- I just simply do not understand the ticket system but regardless, don't lose the ticket since they charge a $50 fee if you don't hand them a ticket upon leaving the placeSPECIFICS:- Katz's Pastrami = Lots and lots of meat, which is good. But the proportion to bread and everything else is just off. Don't get me wrong, the pastrami is the best that I've ever had and to be honest, I'm not a big pastrami person and even I think it's good. But it is a little underwhelming after you've had the first couple of bites.- Fries = So good. There's a good balance of soft and fat fries to the thin and crispy fries so whichever kind you prefer, you're golden. - Pickles = Random thing to put on there, I know. But my god their pickles are so. good. I love pickles in general so that could just be me but I love how they had 2 types of pickles. The one that's not as pickled was delicious. It has a cleaner taste than the darker pickle since it didn't have as strong of a vinigar taste so the spices they used to soak it in was more evidentOVERVIEW:- If you come to NY and you're into the touristy stuff, then this is a must-stop. Despite any complaints that I've had, I'm glad I came here just for the experience and to see what all the hype is about. It's something that you should definitely give a try. But would I ever go through all this again for what I got? Probably not.Instagram @bowtiebowie for more food adventures I don't think my review will affect the sales or opinion of Katz's but having had a fantastic New Years Day meal here, I had to add my praise. The old Automat slogan, ""you can't eat atmosphere"" applies here since, ahem, the decor is at best, historic. Right out of a movie set (literally, as it turns out), you should spend time soaking up the century of cooking and eating that's plastered on the walls. Old photos chronicle The Who's who of past clients.  The program: Walk in, get a ""ticket"" that you hand to your server or carver and the adventure begins. Corned beef or very lean pastrami are the only things to order. You can get hot dogs, etc., elsewhere but this place is a pastrami palace and it's what I enjoyed. I had fries and a cream soda with my pastrami on rye. Good mustard on the side and I was in heaven. Noisy? A little. Fun? A lot! An adventure? Of course. Prices are NYC acceptable and downright cheap when you consider the quality. The now take credit cards too...Put this on your bucket list. Then after eating, cross the street and have gelato for dessert and get ready to send me a thank you card... ;-). This place had such a long line that it wrapped around the corner. I had heard so many good things about this place that I decided to wait in the line while it was snowing!  Thank goodness we were covered from the snow though or else I never would have attempted to try. Once you are in, you can choose to either continue standing in line and order once you get to the counter for to go or to find yourself a table which is hard because that place was sooo packed! The other option was to wait for a table for waiter service. I chose to wait for waiter service so I would be guaranteed a table. There is a waiting area on the side where you wait to get your named called. You can order a beer to enjoy just to make the wait seem shorter. Upon getting seated I tried the cornbeef sandwich and the pastrami sandwich. Each sandwhich was about a whooping ~$20. I don't think I've ever spent so much on a sandwich before. They are pretty hefty in size so if you don't want to be stuffed I would suggest splitting one with someone.The matzo ball soup is definitely one of the weirdest soups I had ever had. The broth is very flavorful with a beef flavor but then there is literally a ball of boiled dough with it too. It's not bad - just different for me!Now getting onto the sandwiches... I really never have had corn beef and pastrami this GOOD before. It went really well with the pickles they came with. Probably the best corn beef I ever had. Even though the sandwich was so basic... it was perfect. This place is a must if you're visiting New York or even a resident. I'm so happy to live close by, it's truly a treat! The pickles, slaw, and pastrami are unbelievable. While you're waiting for your sandwich aka watching them prepare it and having your mouth water like you've never known.... the guy cutting up the pastrami and other meat willGive you a sample. Seriously it melts in your mouth. If you've never been you need to go! It's always very busy so be prepared for a wait of some sort. I will be going back regularly and next time will try a knish! First review of 2018 goes to the famous Katz's. Prior to coming here, I've only seen photos of long lines crowding around the counter, waiting for large, juicy pastrami sandwiches. I honestly didn't know what else to expect. We came on a Monday around 11am and were so lucky to beat the lunch rush. We were immediately seated at the table-service section (didn't know that was an option). Our party of 2 had to share a table with another couple, which I didn't mind. Of course, we ordered the Katz's Pastrami and added cheese. The corned beef sounded good too, but after seeing other people's giant sandwiches, we decided to split one. For $22, it's quite pricey, but the quality and size is well worth it. The meat is tender and fatty, the cheese nicely melted, the regular bread worked well. They also have hoagies but I wanted the original. The mustard is a MUST. It completes the sandwich. They have a whole bottle at each table, so you'll always have the perfect ratio of meat to condiment.Cash only. Keep the ticket they give you prior to entering. They won't let you leave without it! True NY Jewish deli experience at Katz's. Bustling around lunchtime on a Monday afternoon. We chose waiter service, but you can also order at the counter and take to a table. Service was great, unfortunately didn't get our server's name, but he was amazing. Very genuine, and wanted us to have a great experience. I got the matzo ball soup with the half hot turkey sandwich. My pops got the corned beef sandwich and potato pancakes. Everything was fantastic. The matzo soup was flavorful, and matzo ball was airy. The potato pancakes had great flavor and were very well done. It was probably some of the best sliced turkey I've ever had. Definitely recommend the hot turkey. I don't do beef, so I skipped the gravy, but I can imagine that it would have made it even better! Pops said the corned beef was great too. Portions were monstrous as they should be from a NY deli. Food came out quickly too. All around great experience at Katz's! Probably the best pastrami I've ever had. This is simplicity at its finest. Juicy, fatty cuts of pastrami layered on to two slices of rye and covered with my mustard. The quality of the pastrami is second to none, and it's what makes the Katz's a worthy must-try for those visiting NY.Prepare to bring enough cash when you come here. You get a purple ticket when you first come in and they take your order on the ticket when you line up in one of six lines. Cash only and you pay with your ticket when you leave. It's a minimum of $20 per a sandwich so it is pretty steep, but it's worth it for the experience. We ordered the pastrami sandwich and corned beef sandwich on rye. Both were good, but the pastrami was my favorite because of the fatty juicy cuts. It doesn't overwhelm you with a blend of flavor, it just overwhelms you with fatty, juicy, pastrami goodness. Definitely a must try whenever you're in NY. Portions are pretty large, so you can split a sandwich with someone. Do expect a wait, took about 45 minutes to wait in line and get our food. The lines are usually pretty big (though surprisingly small when I went there most recently for dinner time on a Wednesday night.) I got a sandwich to go from station no. 4. I wouldn't bother getting sodas here as you can get Dr. Brown's go to go from some bodegas for under half the price but it's one way for them to help pay rent for how massive the place is.The pastrami here is world class and they deserve to be well known for it. The corned beef is also very good though I have had better. Sure the prices are very high but 25+ dollars for a massive sandwich which feels like is 2 or 3 pounds is fine as you get two meals out of it. I would say the pickle is just OK.As I have a local kosher deli, it feels weird when people order meat and cheese here. Then again, to each their own. Very good stuff here. It's a tourist stop but all the good things of being one (just get out of the way if you don't know what you want/where to go with a ticket.)4.5 A staple for my Jewish family, we've been making the pilgrimage here from NJ for as long as I can remember, although since I moved to the city about 5 years ago it's been a lot more convenient. We always go the self service route, how it's meant to be. Bring some singles to tip the sandwich makers and they'll likely give you some nibbles while you wait. If you have a pickle preference make sure to let them know (I'm all about the half sours!) Our recommendations are the square potato kinish, corn beef (you can get it lean if that's your preference), pastrami, and the brisket sandwich. If you're with a few people, get a side of cole slaw to add to your sandwiches. Don't forget the amazing mustard and in house Russian dressing. The French fries are nothing to write home about but my dad still loves them. Wash it all down with a Doctor Brown's soda (black cherry or cream are the way to go). Keep in mind if you go during prime time dinner it may be a zoo, but I've only encountered this a few times. Before we came to NYC, everyone said to come to Katz's Delicatessen and get the pastrami sandwich. They also advised to not lose our ticket that we get upon entering. If everyone says to come here, we had to come here. Make sure to bring cash because they are cash only. We got to the restaurant around lunch time. They advised us at the entrance, where you get your ticket, that we could wait for a table which will have a server to serve us or we could get our own food from the cutter then find an open table to dine on. There was a wait for a table and the place wasn't too busy so we took our chances to go cafeteria style. While I was standing in line at the cutter section, someone dining behind us left so Mink quickly took the table. Score! There are two sections in the restaurant. First section is the meats and sandwiches (left and middle of wall). Second section is the grilled items and soup (far right of wall). I first stood in line for the meats and sandwiches because the line was shorter. You'll get a sample slice to munch on while waiting for the cutter to prepare your order. I ordered 1/2 pastrami sandwich and 1/2 brisket sandwich, both with no mustard. It came with two types of pickles. The pastrami sandwich is probably one of the best, if not the best, pastrami sandwiches I've had in my life. Brisket was very good too but you have to get the pastrami sandwich. The pickles were legit! As full as I was at the end of the meal, I ate them all. After ordering in the meat and sandwich section, I stood in line in the grilled items and soup section. Mink wanted a grilled cheese sandwich and I wanted a bowl of their Matzo ball soup. The soup broth was very good and the dish complimented the meal perfectly. Mink really enjoyed her grilled cheese sandwich. Service is very friendly in the entire establishment. There is also free water in the back that is self serve. The restaurant is constantly busy so keep that in mind. You'll pay as you leave. If you have never been here before, you have to come here. Until next time that I'll be in NYC, I'm gonna dream about coming back here... LOVE!!! Need I say more? If you love pastrami, corn beef and steak fries, this is the place!! This is an excellent New York deli that needs locations on the west coast. Whenever we come to New York we always have to make a stop here.  This place was established in 1888 and the staff can be theatrically cranky. They stack the meat really high so hopefully if you come here you are hungry and love meat.  The pastrami is truly the best I've had. It's so good you can eat it plain. It just melts in your mouth. You are given a ticket once you enter. Make sure not to lose it as you use that to pay on your way out. You can either order at the counter or you can sit down and be waited on.  We always just order at the counter as we love watching them make the mile high sandwiches and enjoy conversing with the staff. The steak fries are also amazing and they stack a ton on a plate. We can never finish it.  We usually order the pastrami sandwich on rye bread with some mustard or pastrami and corn beef together.  Both are excellent.   Make sure to also get the two types of pickles with your sandwich! They come with the sandwich. I saw this place written on a post somewhere, looked at the insane amount of reviews on yelp and knew I had to come here to see what it was all about...When I first walked in, it was pretty chaotic. An organized mess. There were several lines everywhere by the counter, but it went fairly smooth considering the line. The seating was pretty packed from the front to the back, but we managed to get seats as well. I came specifically for the pastrami sandwich, so that's what I got despite the price tag on it. The pastrami itself is pretty thick and tastes good. They do stuff quite a bit between the rye bread, so that's a thumbs up. For $21-22 for a regular pastrami on rye sandwich, it's one of the most pricest sandwiches that I paid for, but after my experience, I would say that I'm glad that I tried it once.",https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qr7eSU6CFwRGZ7Rc-QEoTQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LKXrOJekaJZ0YIU8LEvW4A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BMGhFW58teR4L3gA4W4yZA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JZbJ_GshCuauVrYP07HE9g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ybm3BPBB5KbwZWpICOIA2A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OVo_B-8vtnFR8i1CYJ5gDg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pE65cQ20v68tLQ38EVia9w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LmRqwDX5ok01julhXolmFw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mSJ2ejaMX4rg7BgETDL3vg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/27AGPU9bnKe4Z5JAPqedzQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JD7NKMI2ddsY0wUjTkB7fA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/v1Br5_eWpHGGvbeYxOnTsw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yNkMJC-7LkPTkpscCn_a5g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7j6whfZAdg4GgU67whezLQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ND7KGnUq68wUIjXLdPdiig/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/v-kULvV_BmGychuhMMUdJQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/m5R5hrUzvEe7upX4dZxeqQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HhDoY_NG4bCS5ju9qGZalg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WwAyBozKxxdsBbp12LlcDg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Q4IDW3MZsMkwPVVLmkhsnw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/u_uVDdDnu-J9FaWC1w6ThA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lIzW1SaRT6WLyTths5oVdg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BXZXBu7vWZ0ObYqD567_qw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5lKg0gXpeDB3jKUDV8z3SA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tIfU1jTMfx1rsZ_Npyt06w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/R6dzf66llD1FNmpbJfBXTw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fxNlXt2aFVIYS5jYtAEAfQ/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/kikis-new-york,kikis-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Greek,Mediterranean,NA,"Awesome decor, short wait time (late lunch), and friendly staff. The saganaki was the most oddly delicious dish I had all week. The crust was perfectly flaky, with a soft mozzarella like cheese in the middle. The cheese had a sharp flavor similar to parmesan which paired strangely well with the honey and lemon drizzled on top. The lamb and fries were also delicious. The grilled octopus was by far the most tender I've ever had. All in all a great experience. First time having Mediterranean food in Lower Manhattan, and Kiki's definitely lived up to its hype! I came on a Monday around 12:30, and there were only two other tables filled in the cavernous eatery. My two friends and I split two appetizers and two traditional plates, which was more than enough for us.Appetizers:We ordered the lemon potatoes and calamari. The potatoes ($7) were cut into around 6 huge wedges and drenched in creamy lemon sauce. Soo delicious and paired well with the other dishes. Calamari ($11) was lightly breaded and not drenched in oil like a lot of other calamaries I've eaten; overall a lighter dish than expected!Traditional Plates:Lamb Frikassee ($17): Delicious lamb with creamy lemon and dill sauce. Cooked to perfection and didn't taste gamey. Theres also bone marrow u can scoop out thats so freakin good.Moussaka ($15): thought this was a lasagna at first but was wrong af, in size its a little larger than an average slice of lasagna. Its has a toasted and bread-like top with ground beef and mashed eggplant underneath. Has a cinnamony taste that grows on you, my favorite of the two entree dishes we ordered.Overall, a reasonably priced Mediterranean restaurant, with great service and a waitress that allowed us to split the bill three ways (tysm!). The ambiance is comfortable, the bathrooms are seriously so cool, and the location is so low-key (dont let the chinese printing sign that plaques the restaurant fool you). You can't go wrong with this place! Came here with a friend for lunch on a super cold day. The dining area was so much under heated that almost everybody I saw kept their coat on throughout the entire meal. I came through subway so wasn't super cold when I sat down but couldn't feel my toes when I left (after about an hour). So, the meal wasn't comfortable.Food wise I'm happy with it -Melitzanosalata - Amazing! Highly recommended. The pita bread that came with it was nice and warm too! I would repeatedly order this.Loukaniko - Solid. Very nice flavors! But not blown away.Spanakopita - Disappointed. It wasn't even served warm... very blend. Would not order again.Bifteki - My friend liked it. I tried the fries which is nothing special. I'd give a 4 for the food but downgrade for the dining experience! I don't think I will come back until Summer.  The food is definitely not good enough for me to put up eating a meal without proper heating. Unassuming (and hard to find) Greek restaurant in Chinatown. Friday early evening, lots of seating inside and even more further around the back. To start off, shared the Roasted Lemon Potatoes ($7) - several giant potato wedges swimming in moderately chunky lemon sauce. Not too much lemon flavor (some prefer more) and went well with the free bread/pita. For the main course, ordered the Moussaka ($14) - a large square of potato, eggplant, and meat that's very filling. Particularly like the crisped mashed potato layer on top. Also got to try the Imam Baildi ($1) - a vegetarian medley of mostly eggplant and tomato. A little too sweet, so has to be paired with a different sauce to counteract.A range of servers helped us out as more groups came in as the night went along. A different option when in the neighborhood and looking for a quality sitdown. This place is such a gem! The restaurant itself is quite large so we didn't have too long of a wait. We weren't sure how much to order but all the starters were crazy good. We got the Tzatziki and Spanakopita - HIGHLY recommend both. For main dishes we got a bit too much but the Lamb Frikasse was delicious. It was also a lot of food and can be very easily shared. We also had the Garido-Makaronada (Spaghetti with Shrimp) that we opted to get with the anise ouzo cream sauce. Again a large portion and it can get a bit overwhelming with all that cream, but great to share. Overall a wonderful meal - super cozy and filling but oh so delicious! Has anyone ever been to Kokkari in SF?! Only THE top rated restaurant in SF btw. Well, Kiki's is Kokkari without the uppity feel or the uppity price! Soo hayy. Came by for a late night bite with the local buds, and damn, de-freakin-licious! My buds come here way too often apparently bc Kiki herself came up to us and started chopping it up. Comped us an order of the best hummus and tzatziki! YUM. Pita gorging ensued. We also got sides of grilled octopus and some veggies. Finished with the perfect branzino AND a side of spinach feta rice. THAT rice. Ahh. I still think of that rice. The perfect balance to the salty fish. Service was great. Food was fantastic. And ambiance was perfect for a late summer/early fall night. Kiki, you've won me over. 5 stars! Holy Greek wedding! Inconspicuous ""speakeasy"" Greek restaurant smack dab middle of Chinatown. Vanna, I'd like to buy proper grammar please.It is all amazing. Octopus. Yes. Branzino. Yes. Everything. FANTASTIC. The last time I went to a Greek restaurant this mind blowing and amazing was Kokkari in San Francisco and I used to live across the street. Granted, that was twice the price and I went once or twice in a year span. Yes, it is fancy. Yes, I miss living there.That being said, come here, expect to wait a little bit for a table, but check out a bar nearby to kill the time, but don't fill your stomach too much, because you'll need room for all the deliciousness here.Splendid. A great experience. Come. Three hour wait on a Saturday night.  THREE HOURS!!!  After they told our group of 4 only 1.5 hours.  I don't know what kind of berserk operation you're running to have those kinds of waits, but I don't think so.  I suppose we were the dumb ones to keep waiting but you keep thinking ""just another 15 mins"", and then next thing you know... Three hours.  In any case, the food was just blah.  Moussaka was too soggy, lamb was super fatty, but the saganaki was dope.  My advice is to avoid this restaurant on a weekend night, if not altogether. Super solid Mediterranean spot. I'd reco going early as they don't take reservations and get busy really fast esp on a weekend !! Moussaka- some of my friends said this tasted like pumpkin pie ahaha texture wise and I think there is a bit of cinnamon in the. Really good! I fully enjoyed. Super rich bechamel. Mixed grill platter - id say solid for 2 ppl. Lotsa fries!!Octopus - rly soft and tender. Not rubbery like most places. Would def come back Just wow wow wow . Everything we got from this place just blew my mind. The squids wow. The lasagna brother wow. The salad wow. The wine wow. But sadly the desert has scarrd me for life. I mean i will never be able to have cheesecake agian. Because 8 will compare it to here. Wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww i ordered twice. I will always remember the taste and texture of it. Thing will never be the same agian. Too bad i live in LA California. I will miss this place. Hope to cone there agian soon Great service but the food was meh. Not exciting for the price... needed more spices. Tried a bunch of food that was all fabulous, but the savory standout was the Pastitchio. Basically it's a Greek lasagna. It's one of the house specialities, and you can't go wrong. All. That. bechamel. Yum. Ambience is chill, but I particularly love all of the different rooms you can sit in. We passed through about four rooms until we got our table, but it was a small, intimate space. Good for not having to scream over each other to have a conversation. KenScale: 8.0/10I was following Google Map on my way to Kiki's and then suddenly got lost briefly because there was a Chinese sign at the location where the restaurant was supposed to be. Interesting... Isn't this supposed to be a Greek restaurant? Well, this neighborhood is Chinatown after all, and the owner of the restaurant must've thought it wasn't worth changing the sign to Greek letters. In any event, the restaurant got quickly packed and there were people who started waiting on the queue soon after my wife Jun and I, plus another couple, got seated (we showed up around 7 p.m. on a Friday evening). Greek cuisine is still an area I haven't had a chance to fully explore (compared to, say, Italian or Japanese), but I can tell why Kiki's is a popular tavern in this remote area of the city. The solid food offerings here is likely to please almost anyone who is on the table. We started with a couple of spreads. Jun is always partial to tzatziki (the Greek yogurt dip with cucumber) so we ordered one here, along with fava (creamy golden split-pea puree topped with tomato onion sauce and capers). The favorite for our party, however, was the simple, smoky eggplant mash topped with crushed walnuts. The smoky feel of eggplant was quite addictive without overpowering in flavor. The Grilled octopus at Kiki's, while simply prepared, was almost cooked to perfection in terms of texture, which is often hard to pull off at a restaurant. We also ordered spaghetti with shrimp and light white wine-tomato sauce, which turned out to be slightly more interesting than a run-of-the-mill tomato spaghetti dish in flavor. The savory course ended with a large plate of mixed grill accompanied by hand cut fries and grilled pita. We had more mixed experiences here. By far the best meat items were lamb shops which were cooked very nicely without overpowering flavor while maintaining smoky feel; on hindsight, we should've just ordered more lamb chops instead of going with the mixed grill. On the other hand, loukaniko (orange peal flavor traditional sausage) and bifteki (classic Greek spiced ground-beef patty) were both over-seasoned such that we couldn't get much out of the texture of either meat. For desserts, we shared the classic baklava (honey-walnut-filled layers of filo dough) and a massive shredded pastry topped with creamy vanilla custard, whipped cream and pistachios. Both were a little bit too sweet for my taste, although my sweet tooth wife didn't complain as she savored every bite of baklava.The restaurant doesn't accept reservations so I highly recommend visiting early to get seated without long wait times. There are some interesting Greek wines (both white and red) that you may want to try to complement your meal. The hip atmosphere of the dining space, where the crowd was mostly on the younger side, makes Kiki's an ideal place for a casual dinner with friends before a night out in nearby Lower East Side. Kiki's is the type of no-frills place that I would love to come again and sample more dishes of Greece. We live around the neighborhood and have been wanting to stop by and try their brunch. However, we ended up coming here for dinner. We had the melitzanosalata, spanakopita the kayanas and the whole red snapper. The time frame they served the the appetizer til before the red snapper was probably every 3 mins. We felt rushed. The dish we liked the most was the melizabosalata. All other dishes were not hot enough. We're most likely not going to return. I really, really like it here. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because the wait to get in is a real struggle. Expect a 1.5-2 hour wait for dinner on weekends. As I'm a fat kid at heart and love Greek food, I've eaten everything on the menu, and it's all delicious. The beef patties, octopus, dips, and zucchini chips. The one thing I'd maybe stay away from moving forward is this lamb dish cooked in hollandaise sauce. Get a FIX beer, too. The Greeks aren't renowned for their wine, but it's certainly nice to have at Kiki's. Don't miss it. I'm a fan. Came here for the first time as requested by a friend of mine. Was very excited to try this and wasn't disappointed with the food except for dessertOrdered:Mama's Oven Roasted Chicken: very delicious, this was served over potatoes and a lemon sauce which made it even more deliciousMoussaka : a mixture of eggplant, potato, beef &amp; pork topped with bechamel sauce. Crunchy on top and soft and savory on the inside, one the favorites here! Pastitchio: aka cousin of Moussaka. This looked also like the moussaka except that the taste was different. Greek Yogurt: for dessert. We got this with honey and walnuts and apples. This wasn't very satisfying as there wasn't enough honey and walnuts. The walnuts were too chopped up you can barely taste it. Walked in on a Sunday evening and got seated right away, but the place was packed. Both the food and the service was outstanding! We had the spanikopita as an appetizer which was loaded with spinach and feta and had a crispy filo crust. The portion was sizable, definitely big enough for 2 to share. My friend had the moussaka which she gave 2 thumbs up on. I had the whole branzino which was one of the best I've ever had. Moist and flaky inside with a crispy skin. For dessert we shared the Ekmek Kataifi which was good. The cheesecake and yogurt both looked good too. The atmosphere is very cozy and warm.  I would definitely come back here! Cute restaurant, friendly service but food was just okay, maybe I had too much of an expectation to replicate my experience in Greece...We ordered the Briam, grilled octopus and whole grilled red snapper with lemon potato. Briam and the lemon potato were delicious, but the seafood dishes fell short. Octopus was of a mushy texture, but the flavor was there. Red snapper was overly charred, therefore very dry and hard to eat. You can really tell the freshness of the seafood by its texture; our red snapper was also of a mushy texture, which is not a good sign. Maybe I just had a very high expectation given the 4.5 stars rating on yelp, but in the end this is just New York, not some Greek island.... Good Greek food what else to add. We went with ground of three there was a wait but they had space at the bar so we went for it. Got bunch a small plates everything was pretty good and I enjoy it. The wine was ok but I'm usually not a fan of Greek wine unfortunately maybe didn't have a chance to try a good one:(we split some entrance was super easy in and out dinner. Probably won't go back unless I'm at the area cause didn't find enthroned so special but a good authentic food. A Greek restaurant with only Chinese signage and wooden flat tops and benches, serving La Colombe coffee and filled with hipsters. It is quaint, trendy, and all that, and cannot be more different from other Greek restaurants in the city like Milos and Limani. The food is traditional and straightforward, but can suffer in execution. The horiatiki comes with perfectly sized peppers and onions and some really delicious feta. The octopus was tender but sadly too soft. The moussaka was airy and fluffy but too bland. I think the best way to go is order some dips, pita and small plates, and stay away from the entrees, although the best selling dishes on a Sunday afternoon were from their breakfast menu.",https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EEdG9No3eY6WJePxCe9ezA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5fCPpT0Ygtp7N8rKEpwuZQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AvSQcHJCmcqSFcY9oPEo_Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-wV4-KAAv0KySKZCj_o1aQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SMm66BYhS4ZWsuuszMW_dw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EOCDFqPeNUJ6wHvGBYEA3g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Hwx1T79iWgN1LXi8JBlzMQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/t4MILWULon9ychWMw8WAXw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oXLRR_bBwvqhOhRjgYEFVQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ngHIyY2TQ44AsXQqTA9hYA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/E5PBXKhVWW2WC4js-cR9qA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Hx4meWCJTqZF8b9azcW0TQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/r3qoij2MT41OAIG_Sbvi1A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/N22L8-qhMe2oFPezIkeU4w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XEtbvNAxd9Op7Q2V9OI10g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UOlanPWLKUO0kbZYQ5Jh9Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RxxC5balc9VB3vdHCB3kwA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FlI3Q709DpMU-CJD2Po_-Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fEJKCNXvnDqHelpnX6eykg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TbBsb4eJEcJ3aKO8zA3w0A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XTI-pU9-4QhCeM-5jqmgcA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DjLxohuleLeP72-pxdUR-Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GGNL1bexBQ5UKWw1srcKjw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PJLNvc4SopSTrtOCuDfFEw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/f4O8-LvWgIs5xMI9fmV_zA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DiIKuYsr-7DPIECTjdFf-A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EWzveItdb0A-QEGYYc2HWw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yf6vQ87Op2hNyl0KahsrvQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5tzofW5PkgVBgwZrT-ZZIA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/aYajje27CMQvxh7yn5tNAw/258s.jpg
https://www.yelp.com//biz/kottu-house-new-york,kottu-house-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Sri Lankan,NA,NA,"Being a Sri Lankan and living in Toronto where we have our fair share of kottu, I was very excited to check out Kottu House on a recent trip to NYC and see how Kottu House elevates Kottu from Sri Lankan street food to a trendy dish in Manhattan. I must say that the end result lived up and probably exceeded my expectations! I got their chicken kottu and loved everything about it, from the package it comes in to that feeling of being back in Sri Lanka and digging in to a heap of kottu. Bonus points for the fact that it was Chelaka's (the owner) mom that made our food that afternoon.The ""unfortunate"" thing about my visit here is that kottu fills one up quite well so I was unable to try out their whole menu as would have been ideal despite being an unreasonable goal. I did have the lentil patties and they were delicious and made just the way I like! Thinking back, I do believe this experience of kottu is one you can never have in Sri Lanka. Kottu places in Sri Lanka are most likely going to have one beer in stock (Lion beer which is also found here) but the fact that Chelaka has paired his kottu with some great craft beer selections really does make for an experience that one can not find in Sri Lankan or even up in places here in Toronto where I've yet to experience a good beer with Kottu. And I think that's what makes Kottu House a unique experience! I was also introduced to Sangria in a can which was surprisingly good! But as many would attest, kottu goes best with a side of beer! I'd happily recommend anyone visiting NYC to give Kottu House a go for an amazing yet affordable meal in the city. TL;DR. The restaurant is homophobic. This happened on Jan 27, 2018. A group of us had been partying at The DL. We were about 7 members in the group and the time was 11 and we decided to grab dinner at Kottu House because it was near and open. Some of them in the group wanted to use the washroom as well but we weren't sure whether there were restrooms on the premises. One of my friends found it at the back and called out to another friend who had also wanted to use it saying ""There's a restroom at the back."" It was this point when the guy behind the counter dropped the remark ""If you guys want to shag, go together."" (FYI: All of us were gay) I initially dismissed the remark as something in jest but then I realized the entire episode has the unmistakable stench of bigotry. The remark as such was caustic, deeply offensive and in bad taste (Pun unintended). It wasn't a sign of open-mindedness but rather a regressive and petty mindset which I had been fortunate so far to not witness it in NYC. It reeked of homophobia and when we protested, he gave a non-apology apology and was smiling through it all, as if he had come up with something terribly clever. The whole episode was uncharacteristic of NYC which pretty much led the battle cry for LGBT rights from the front. I know I am not reviewing the food but I am reviewing the attitude of this establishment which defines the ambience of the restaurant. At a time when LGBT rights are being threatened, I strongly condemn the attitude of this unfunny guy (I think he's the proprietor of the restaurant). I urge any members and allies of the community to avoid a homophobic establishment such as this. I have just one thing to say to the guy who made the remark, ""It's sad that you feel threatened by the members of the LGBT community. I suppose, unlike you, we prefer bedrooms to restrooms"". The first time I tried this place a year ago, the food was SO flavorful and full of different spices. And I'm also a big spicy food lover so I was thrilled when I tasted the kick in the food! I remembered this experience and wanted to come back again! Unfortunately it changed COMPLETELY. I don't know what happened but it was so flavorless that I was struggling to even finish half of that little box. I only ate what I did because I was starving. Also, I asked them to make it super spicy. It wasn't spicy at all, so I asked if they could make it spicier. They gave me a little cup of sambol which did not do the job AND THEY CHARGED AN EXTRA $2 FOR IT!!!?? Lmao are you serious?? I do not recommend this place and would never go back. Born a South-Indian, you'd think I'm biased towards Sri Lankan cuisine, but going by the demographic distribution of the crowds that flock this place, I can tell you I am not. There are very few restaurants in town that serve the cuisine and this is one of my 2 favorites.Start with the short eats.- Fish Cutlets: Tuna fritters filled with vegetables and Sri Lankan spices. Yum yum yum!- Lentil Patties: Deep-fried patty with crushed lentils, onion and spices. The side-kick - minchi sambol comes with it. Very unique and traditional. May not blow your mind ('cos the dish by itself is simple), but get it just for checking off this dish from your to-do list of global dishes!Try the hopper next.- Egg hopper: Sri Lankan rice and coconut milk crepe with a sunny side up egg. If this is too heavy for you, get the plain hopper. You will also need to order one of the sambols, Lunu Sambol (with raw onions) or/and Minchi Sambol (with grated coconut) on the side to go with it.Now comes the show-stopper!- Crispy Prawn:  Fried prawns, anointed with Sri Lankan flavors along with chopped stir-fried roti  with a blend of curry, eggs and vegetables. This is hands-down, the best dish on the menu.-Tofu blast:  Tofu cooked in a black curry with coconut milk and spices is the best option for vegetarians.BEWARE of the spice-level. Even their ""medium"" spice is very spicy and that coming from a South-Indian! Also suggest getting a chilled ginger beer (oops, forget I said ginger, just get the lager) on the side to counter the extreme spice!Small, cozy place with not much seating. Love the demure black-and-white ancestral portraits donning the main wall. Zest across the street was packed and loud, so was the Mexican place.It's the lower east side, and this strip feels a bit on the gentrified side, but you can still eat for around $15.We ducked into Kottu House because it had no line.  We knew nothing about it.I didn't even know what a Kottu is.  It's a Sri Lankan fried rice and damn is it good.I had the chicken kottu on low spice $9 served in a little take out carton and it was purrfect.  Tasty, the right amount and for the quality, not over priced. The place is friendly, super casual with style and small.  They also have beers for around $8 and up.I felt so satisfied.  A little gem. Friday night, wanted something heavy and quick before a night of drinking. This spot has been on my list for some time as a fast, filling place for food in the area. Not a big place by any means; a couple tables in the middle and booth seating along the edges where it can fit. Was going to order up front, but the guy behind the counter told me to have a seat; giving me a menu and some water. Considering the size of this spot, lots of options to choose from - settled on the Deviled Beef Kottu ($10) and the Fish Cutlets ($6). Cutlets came out first, about 7 lightly fried tuna balls with heavy seasoning inside and served with Sriracha sauce. Fish is good, but creamier than what I expected. Kottu is up next: an extremely dense serving of chopped up roti, spices, veggies, and beef. I asked for medium spice and thankfully so - a significant kick in flavor (even for a guy who loves spicy food). Thankfully there's a water/napkin station to the side.Service here is great - the one guy who works up front keeps everyone happy and at a good pace. Would definitely return again for some of their other dishes. A cozy compact restaurant that serves quality food of Sri Lankan origin. My family loved their first visit here. The ""Kottu"" is probably as good or better than what is served in Sri Lanka. The beef rolls were excellent. The ""watalappan"" was perfect!The guy behind the counter was friendly &amp; all in all it was much value for money. Never disappoints and great food! I've always ordered take-out at this place. Just 1 note, their Regular Spicy (spice level) is very spicy! So if you are not a fan of spicy food, I'd recommend mild spice level.Their Shrimp Kottu is my favorite, but they also have a nice Lamb and Chicken mix Kottu which is quite popular.Service has always been excellent at this place, no problems there! Very good food. Kottu House has many vegetarian options. If had to build a meal for this place I'd go with the lentil patties and the pineapple blast or the tofu blast kottu for vegetarians. My friend gets the chicken option and thoroughly enjoys it. I've also tried the sweet hopper, and it was a very unique dessert experience Tofu Blast Kottu (4/5)No joke spice in this they're not fucking around even with the ""mild"" in quotation marks because it wasn't even close to mild. But the kottu itself was really good, reminded me of Chow Fun noodles. (Vegan if you as for no egg)Lentil patties (3/5)Dry. The sauce they came with was good tho. South Asian French fries (1.5/5)I couldn't taste any French or any fry because the spice was really overwhelming. Friendly staff, delicious food, small spot with a cool vibe.  It's so fun to try different foods (I'd never had Sri Lankan street food before) and I love all the photos/memorabilia on the wall.  This is a great lunch deal-very filling, delicious and customizable.Awesome causal NYC restaurant, definitely check this place out if you're in the area. Delicious and spicy dinner. I'll come back to sample the other delights on the menu. I miss things that speak to my palate; this is certainly one of them My friend is leaving for Sri Lanka in a few days so she wanted a sneak peek and good ol Yelp showed us Kottu House.   The spot is small and cozy with a cool decor. We started with the spicy crispy calamari which was probably the best fried calamari I have ever had. Not greasy or chewy in the slightest. Dusted with cayenne and paprika and served with sriaccha on the side it is utterly addicting. For a main I had the classic chicken kotu which is chopped roti stirfried with egg,spices and chicken. Went with the second hottest spice level and it was perfect especially with the crisp,cold pear cider I got.   The service was great. Jeff our server was one if the coolest dudes I've met in a long time. A fellow comics geek he kept the small room engaged and talked to all the customers as if they were long time friends. -1 star is the price point for their main dishes. The food is really good, super spicy! I love spicy food, and when I got their spicy for the first time during their lunch hour, I literally died a bit. I could not take more than 3 bites in a row without tearing. Today, I went and got mild. Boy, it's still spicy!! A size large of their entrees are around $15, which is okay for a large. But, their large are not big, it's more of a mediumish size, which is ehh, because I won't get full. If you can't handle spice well, get the super super mild. I had their chicken last time, I can't really say much about the flavor because I couldn't finish it due to it being too spicy. I got the prawn today in mild, very good. Tasty but greasy. For what you get (a meal served in a doggy bag), it is not even that cheap. The staff is friendly, but allow a week for proper digestion. Did a delivery order yesterday with Uber Eats.  Crazy, it wasn't a bicycle it was a walking delivery guy!! Awesome, can't believe he did that despite the 10 degree F weather and the snow last night!  Makes you feel so guilty sitting at home all warm.  Oh btw, if you haven't tried Uber Eats, use this code to get $15 off your first order (sorry, guaranteed to work, but gotta be 1st time): eats-anitas561ueNote unlike other delivery services (Yelp, Seamless) that Uber raises prices slightly plus adds a service charge (pretty sure though you don't tip so that goes toward the tip).  Still worth it if you've got a promo code or you're deadest on ordering out to a place that doesn't do Yelp/Seamless (this place does do Seamless though I'm pretty sure).Love the fake newspaper lining of the boxes!! Yes, exactly like in Sri Lanka.  But well, you know they use real newspapers in Sri Lanka.  Well, I seem to recall they used a lot of kid's school textbooks as well - anatomy/biology diagrams, math equations, etc.  Yes indeed, another kind of recycling than what we're used to!We order 2 small kottus which was enough for us, and cheaper of course.  Only other place close-by that does kottu is Sigiri in East Village, and that costs like $16 so this is a nice compromise.  Really easy to recommend which is the best - get the classic chicken!! The black curry spices were so delicious!! The beef was just ok.  Be aware that medium spicy is a strong medium, so if you don't like spice you might prefer mild.We ordered the Pol Sambol (usually just called coconut chutney in Sri Lanka, or coconut chutney in southern India), you usually have to pay extra, $1-2.  That is super spicy!  But delicious since it has fresh grated coconut.As you can tell, this is mostly Sri Lankan fusion - Italian Kottu, Tofu Kottu, Pineapple Kottu, etc.  None of that obviously exists in Sri Lanka.  Go with the Classic Chicken if you want authentic.  But maybe the other flavors will help convert some newbies.  And if you're ready for the next step in authentic, go to Sigiri East Village or Staten Island ... or hell Sri Lanka 'cause its an awesome place! This place is exactly what you're looking for if you want something ""off the beaten path"" (whatever that means in Manhattan). While most of the big name restaurants were on a 2 hour wait, Kottu House served up a quick and affordable meal that was absolutely and uniquely delicious. My BF has to be careful about spices but they were able to make his classic chicken very mild. I ordered the crispy prawn kottu with a moderate heat level and it was perfect. If you've never had Sri Lankan cuisine, don't be shy. Kottu House is amazing. Just a bit too casual, with aquintances milling about it hanging around your space while trying to have conversation and eat. Food is good, not outstanding. First time having Sri Lankan street food. Were recommended here randomly by group of Sri Lankans walking through China town heading that way. Boy am I glad we stumbled across them! Food was spectacular. We ordered several kottu flavors, but the unanimous favorites for our group were the crispy prawn &amp; egg. As other reviewers have mentioned, the spice chart runs much hotter than most, so even mild is considerably spicy. Be cautious of this, because in our group of four, only one could tolerate the medium. NOT GLUTEN FREE AT ALL.They cook everything on the same surfaces as bread, soysauce and their frier sees mostly breaded items which are battered with regular flour.Despite this, they advertise prominently as gluten free. And were absolutely rude when we traveled from Brooklyn to eat there and basically told that because I have food allergies it was ""understandable"" that I would not want to eat mislabelled food. Never one single apology or suggestion of alternatives.",https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HI1tvmf1IRAsScm3i5to8A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bfr5E3EHIoKVUqgWaJ7Ocg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fT-9_glMYToIRCHlwWZLtw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2VfwNo86UblL2qB2CLta8A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VA6ttj_xEOPEN06819UO1A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hVjcLJDsphOUkDgTIl2B6Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6RUzWE6sXCl8hK5itcfOyQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ho0U_C8pHYcxNJMltxolow/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Aet_J5NFWVT7WE9yqp5EKg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jr1sT2HVdcfBx2NgbenDGg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bN0PZO_4mC_zUT-NXl-1xQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wMTZw8g-Gu3Q7MYQuW4DaQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8GGtUsqTtJGRFvVy_9OBQA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cCQz6o9vp3-Qz5Sq_8L_Tg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GQ28UIZ1WEKTOCSXCTlwBQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xjNt3ENM1YEr2LuWQunl1Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dc3ZrZ0BIFM9XHL8EbIXEA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cIZcfdM_P0hLI0ujTw4Qbw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bbID3KFYM8bSDZYYK72SWQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AbnhHlob1v9qOSC2Gl9haA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NopTf7y9bkN3_SiafLcsYA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UHvTcFpf_1QRbGfaBcKCng/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UK1mUWpGydkhb2NT769Oyw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/y6F8P6dtinwW19cesDtgLw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Eo1GrJVyLSlAWO2dusGTZA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/o-RHWidz3xcYKNiroxVxGg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/s1zf_gXvoep7QKLQTTifuw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9BT2Qbq-kTFXtGOgYxufeg/258s.jpg,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,la-colombe-coffee-new-york-2,New York,10002,NY,Coffee & Tea,NA,NA,"This was my second time trying La Colombe in NY. I tried a regular latte and a draft latte at the location near Times Square. First off, the regular latte was delicious. Good coffee flavor, mellowed out by the steamed milk. The star of the show, however, was the draft latte. It tasted like a very thin milk shake that was not too sweet. I kid you not. It was so delicious that I probably could have drank three of them in one sitting.The draft latte was so good that I came here a second time on my last day in NY, skipped getting a drink at Jack's Wife Freda, just so I could sip on the delicious milkshake... er I mean coffee.I know there are lots of coffee places to choose from in NYC, but I definitely recommend giving Colombe's draft latte at least one go! So, so good. While I haven't tried anything other than their lattes, I can vouch that the lattes are awesome! The service is speedy so if you're in a pinch for some coffee, don't hesitate if you see a long line!I also brought home a box of the Ethiopian coffee beans. They are fresh and delicious even at home. 10/10 would recommend Great coffee long line that goes by fast.  I kinda ruined my order but they fixed it with ease.Would be been if I knew certain drinks were cold only before I paid and that's the minus one star.All else is good!Let the caffeine commence! Came here with several friends on a Friday afternoon because we were tired and wanted a jolt of caffeine while we were in the area. I've been wanting to try out their drinks here for a while now. Instead of settling for their famous cold brew, I went with several of my fellow-Yelper's recommendations and ordered a medium almond latte. There was a line, (there always is going to be) but it moved relatively quickly. When I received my drink, I was disappointed in the fact that my drink consisted of 75% ice and 25% latte itself. The almond latte itself wasn't bad, but it sure wasn't effective in keeping me awake.Overall, I don't really recommend the Almond latte if you're seeking an energy boost. I've been here before in the past, but only to grab a croissant. Maybe next time I'll try the cold brew to see what the hype is all about. All I can say is yum!They handle long lines like it's nobody's business! And the draft latte is just so insanely delicious!Why go to Starbucks when you can get a better cup of coffee at a place like this?! Probably one of my favorite places for coffee! I've been here multiple times and also drink their canned draft lattes when I'm not in the city. You can't go wrong with a regular latte but I would suggest getting the black and tan (draft latte and nitro cold brew). I find the draft latte in stores is a bit light for my taste so the cold brew balances it out and gives it more depth. Only downside is that there isn't much seating at this location. This is a super solid place for morning/afternoon coffee! Don't be intimidated when you come during peak times and the line is out the door because it moves super quickly.That being said, know what you want as soon as you enter because the baristas will call out and ask what you want when you're on line. They do that so by the time you pay up front, your drink is already prepared for you. Perfect for anyone who just needs a quick grab and go! Went here on a recommendation from a friend.  Nice little coffee shop.  Empty on a Thursday afternoon.  They had two different kinds of brewed coffee.  I tried the darker one and that was good.  My friend recommended the draft latte.  I thought it was good but not my style.  Very creamy. Meh. Needed an afternoon wake-me-up and found this place was close-by to wherever we were headed. When we walked up, it seemed like they had a decent stream of people in line that moved very fast. Maybe I'm not enough of a coffee aficionado to appreciate whatever this is but ordered two regular iced lattes. It's okay that they don't have flavors (vanilla, caramel etc) ... but my friend wanted a sweetened one and they just handed him packets of sugar LOL. It's pretty hard to dissolve solid sugar in iced drinks, usually just end up with chunks of crystal sinking to the bottom but welp.Very low interaction rate with customers and kinda comes off stand-offish, imo. Might be a normal thing for the city, but who knows, I'm a tourist LOL. Probably better of sticking with starbucks trollolol. In the city that never sleeps and is always constantly on the move, this is their ish but I'm used to coffee shop cafes where you can relax and lose track of time ... although, it is pretty interesting they pull their lattes off draft and also sell canned caffeine drinks. I have only to say that this was an experience. It may sound funny and exaggerated but my visit here was definitely a moment in my coffee-drinking life. The draft latte here is definitely one-of-a-kind. Very unique. This was my first time trying draft latte and I could see why others praise it.The draft latte is very light and refreshing - almost gives you the sensation that you are drinking draft beer. Unlike regular latte with rich milky flavor, this one is more pleasant. You must try it to understand. After brunching at Jack's Wife Freda a block away, we came here to have a second round of caffeine and a chatter. I enjoyed La Colombe coffee at every locations I've been to, and this place was no exception.The drip coffee was very aromatic and strong. I wish there were coffee shops like La Colombe in NJ and no more of Starbucks, please (although I'll continue to go to Starbucks for the rest of the year to use up all the gift cards I received over the Christmas holidays ;)While sipping on our coffees, it started to snow outside, which was pretty picturesque and romantic on this cold, gray afternoon. I missed small moments like this that I had while I was living in the city a couple of years ago. One small downside is that they had very limited number of seats. We were lucky to secure a table, but I saw a lot of people waiting while sipping on their coffee, and heading out to the door when they had finished. Coffee here is always dialed, especially for a 3rd wave chain. Recommend the house blend espresso straight up or the cortado. Also highly recommend the Black and Tan, a blend of the nitro brew and draft latte on tap. not my favorite.  I hate that you're supposed to know how to order here with no menu.  Staff needs to understand not everyone is an expert.  But the coffee is very good... Selection of Columbian coffee. Small range of espressos and coffees. There's a small seating room area but it's mostly a grab n go coffee spot. Biscuits were ok This place is by far one of my most coveted coffee shops! I tend to be a hard critique of the taste of any cafe's black coffee, but La Colombe's coffee is soft, not too bitter, and has a wonderful aroma to it. It just goes down so smoothly. They also have this amazing cold brew/iced latte combo called the Black and Tan, which is a drink that is half cold brew and half iced latte (on tap). It's so pleasing to look at too because the latte they pull from tap is so silky and not super foamy so it sits nicely on top of the cold brew. You can either just drink it without mixing it or take the long spoon they serve it with to mix the it together before drinking it. Either way, it's refreshing and so delicious that I go back to La Colombe every time to just get this drink.I visited this location by SOHO multiple times and each time, the line was always to the door or out the door. The store itself is on the smaller end with limited seating. But the line moves quickly so you won't be waiting long for your drink. Their pastries are also delicious! A perfect pick me up after a lot of walking around. Great ambiance, so it's a nice location to meet with friends, too! The smell of coffee in there was very delightful. Pros:* Diverse customer-base, great for people watching* Surprisingly good amount of seating* Clean* Beautiful marble bar top that you can actually grab seats at* ""Coffee on-tap"" for those of you hipsters who are too good for drip coffee* Decent amount of space between the tables so you're not made to feel like you're sitting on your neighbor's lapCons:* Baristas. Always the baristas at places like this. I want to - for once - go to a non-chain caf and have a barista smile at me instead of being a condescending dickhole* The ambiance feels like all they care about is turnoverWould only recommend this place if you're a) in the neighborhood and b) don't plan on staying for too long. Definitely do not recommend being a regular here. Would like to consult for them to make it a more inviting ""neighborhood coffee shop"" but she's probably a 30-year-old former art student who wouldn't care about my ""corporate "" ass anyway This is my Favorite coffee place in New York. Try out the oat milk latte - it tastes like a hug in a cup. Worth the $5.50 splurge if you're needing a morning pick me up, or just want to feel cozy. Lines can get pretty long, but they handle them like a champ! This location has zero seating (I really think there is actually one tiny bench). La Colombe and I have a love-hate relationship. I dislike the lack of menu and pricing - it gives off a kind of ""if you know you know, if you don't get out"" kind of vibe. The prices are steep for the portions.That being said, their draft latte is out of this world. I don't know why it's so good, but it is. And it keeps me coming back. For me, it's a coffee I get once a week or so, but not my daily go-to coffee. Too many people tell me it's the most amazing coffee in the neighborhood. I don't think it was bad by any means but it was definitely not the best thing I've ever had. It was literally just coffee. I think it's overhyped, and very hipster inspired which is why it has such positive reception.",https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/m9eZazy8jLN3egwmEKbnWQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/h2uyvOZ3dCMhdxUC_2oeig/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/l6Fnd8wbMaOLfZiPgbMZCQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/c0WQf94ykbkR3qGY5kWNkw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TRj1xEkhS7mWMzFeWN_Jhg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oOdJN8Cs9cFx5bWPXHatTg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/erQ0AldTd_ZLdvA_rEr4Iw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nE45UVilT2Hqwg7ieV9eyQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Q9mCheSb1WDgj51LnJrR5w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1as4sBzlvrIXcuY2ev3qdQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6j27l5rIkTs8KOZOtc9t_Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IcUUv08aHLNGumBhrpWvqw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BDkc6jimh0SsnyRmzoMIkA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mFP91kyIgDisH_x3LPujJA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Lwp-VXA5guMGkrjM_RMakg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/y8drcUZdGMqa7BYc0RmX6g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EjpxlubOtpVGTpnfy4T8pg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8ly89xSbTX6GtpV_BNfNOg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Z2Pyu4ZH6n9dCFSLWQsNLA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8UTAUQUn9UEHsXm_zfge4Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VZ8WXHqKWSO6v6Iqgf4-Ww/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rxX9ndD-DUGDI5Ypy_4GNQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/o1AZEVyN7JJRe3w3gOzB7A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/z6Dw2OCtQ3uen_OXgqG-6Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XnXLihRJs2I-BRcElFKCSA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Cn4_zsN7na6IlKogtTMByA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_jsUHMZstl2D6bP7-PxGHw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gDVaP7CvotS_xhFI57seEw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AKRJAHmLq3pdcQQMFIOfnA/258s.jpg,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/la-contenta-new-york,la-contenta-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Mexican,Bars,Breakfast & Brunch,"Everything is fantastic here but good luck getting a table! It's really good and everybody knows it, so it's packed. I had been here in the past a couple of times for bites.Their cocktails are fantastic. I really enjoyed El Mixteco which consists of hibiscus infused mezcal, lemon juice, agavero liqueur and agave nectar.Service is great, at the end of our group's meal, we were offered tequila shots on the house, which is always appreciated! Fantastic Happy Hour!!I came with 2 girlfriends last Monday and were lucky to snag a table ""outside"" under a heat lamp without a reservation. It was a warm night for January and sitting there was perfectly fine, not cold at all.The service here is great. Our waitress was more than willing to make suggestions. I had a Mayan cocktail (I could not resist corn in a cocktail) and a margarita. The Mayan was delicious but I wished I could taste more corn in it. The margarita was fantastic too. My friends both absolutely loved their Essex Crossing drink (I think that was the name. Gin &amp; blackberry in it)We all ordered the fish tacos which were SOOOOO GOOD. A bit saucy, slightly messy but perfectly crispy fish. I had to get a second order of them. Not even slightly ashamed. Happy hour prices are great too. For 3 people who had 2 dishes and 2 cocktails each our bill was only $78. Honestly not bad for the quality of the food. Only downside is that this place is VERY small so make a reservation. I came here last night with a friend only to be greeted by a rude &amp; condescending hostess. I arrived at 6pm and asked if I could get a table but the hostess said it was for the lady in front of me and I would be next. Knowing it was almost a full house and the only seats left were at the bar, I decided to sit at the bar instead. I sensed she wasn't too happy and gave a bit of an attitude so I figured maybe she had a bad day.My friend came 5-10 minutes later and because we were carrying so many bags, she wanted to see if we could get a table instead. The hostess said ""there's someone else in front of you"" which was not true because no one else came after me so ok whatever, we can sit at the bar. Then my friend asked if there was a happy hour menu but turns out we just missed it at 6pm which is fine too so my friend proceeded back to the seat at the bar.Now this was what changed it for us. The menu was open in front of us and earlier, a waiter had placed the chips and salsa on top of the menu. She walks over and lifts up the plate, rudely slams it on the table, and closes the menu. She doesn't say anything like ""sorry I don't want to get the menu dirty"" or smile in the process? Something at least? But whatever it is, that was very rude especially when my friend asked her questions very nicely. I personally don't like leaving a restaurant when I've already been seated and the waters/breads/chips etc. are already served. However, my friend just wanted to leave and she's right, why should we give any of our business to someone who made us feel unwelcome, and then without saying anything, we just walked out. I wanted to give this place a chance as I go by yelp all the time. Decor was nice (along with the waiter/bartender) and I could see how it could get cozy, but not with this past experience. Maybe it would've been better if we went to their other establishment in west village but I don't think it'll be anytime soon. This place lived up to their name. I was definitely content with this little restaurant. You walk in and you already feel like you're in Mexico. It has a bunch of cute artifacts and decorations that expresses halloween or day of dead. However this place is pretty small - this might just be a NY thing where all their restaurants are small. The waitress was super excited to help with our orders. She was a very cute lady who tried to help us choose our drinks. One time we kept ordering Mirosa and thought they meant mimosa but she corrected us but after awhile she kept saying mimosa too. The mirosa drink was not bad if you like something light. If you wanted something stronger you can get the Mayan. The food was on spot. I never had Huevos rancheros like this. Every bite was super flavorful. I can't compare these meals to Mexico but compared to North Carolina they made them look bad. I guess you can say I won't be going to another Mexican place in NC. Must warn you that if you are sensitive to spicy food you might want to be careful in which dishes you get. I LOVE SPICY. So this was the place for me but my friend who loves spicy but can't handle it was sweating up a storm. Honestly it wasn't that spicy but I guess we'll never know. The other reviews about terrible customer service and a condescending hostess are true. The hostess was rude, unwelcoming and acted like she was doing us a favor by putting our names down. She scowled the whole time and told us it would be about 90 mins so we went down the block for some drinks. Typically when I get crappy attitude from the get go I don't bother putting my name down because there are a million spots that I can go to. It's NYC, competition is stiff and I'm not one to wait 90 mins for dinner when already hungry. Anyway, my friends really wanted to try La Contenta so I begrudgingly waited. We went back to check on the status of the reservation a bit earlier than 90 mins to make sure we were there when the table became available. When we inquired about our table, the hostess looked like she was exasperated with us for no reason. Her reply was ""I told you it was busy, maybe another hour but I don't think you'll get in tonight"". Umm excuse me? She definitely gave our table to another party... how do you work as a hostess and underestimate that badly?!We took our business elsewhere that night. I thought about going back to actually try the food but haven't bothered. And with that attitude at the door we'll probably will never try again. It's a shame how much business a restaurant can lose with shitty service. Came for an impromptu dinner with a friend. The place was packed and somehow they manged to make a space for us. Awesome customer service and fantastic drinks. The bartender will take care of you! The food was delicious! Authentic and flavorful. Our waiter was very helpful with recommendations. I don't know how he managed to make us feel so special with such a packed house. I will definitely return! I will be dreaming of the fish tacos here for the rest of my life. That's how good they were and that's how excited I am to get back here ASAP. Went for a friend's birthday, and I'm glad we picked this spot. I had a blackberry michelada, which the bartender was afraid I wasn't going to like because it tastes like a ""citrusier"" Bloody Mary (savory and spicy), but I thought the drink was excellent. We then ordered fish tacos (please see the first line for my description of the near orgasmic experience I had over those flaky, savory pockets of goodness). I then had the chicken mole which was nothing short of amazing. I've never had mole sauce that good and the chicken, ugh, I can't even talk about how fantastic it was. This is a much smaller location than the one on the west side, but if you're looking for good food and drinks on the LES, please, PLEASE, go check this place out. You won't regret it. And order the fish tacos for me, because I'm coming back for them. Waited for a while to get seat, it's worth doing that tho. Guacamole dip was better than most i've ever had. The spot was cozy, but the interior attracted me a lot, especially when it was close to the Halloween. This is a GREAT spot. I've been here twice now and have been so pleased both times. It's a super tiny restaurant, so make sure to make a reservation if you can! The happy hour is AMAZING! I believe it's from 5-7p weekdays, and it includes drinks AND food ($8 margaritas and $8 for 2 chicken tacos, for example - the full HH menu is on their website).Things I have gotten and loved include the margarita and the Mayan cocktails, the short rib tacos, chicken tacos, and of course guacamole + chips. Yum! Portions are an adequate size. The staff is always so kind and hospitable. Come on in! Great food, very interesting drinks. The happy hour is from 4-7 and it offers $8 drinks and menu items. I had the Torta and the Fish Tacos, both super tasty. I had The Mayan as my first drink and it was really interesting. I enjoyed it. I then had El Diablo which was supposed to be full of ginger with House made ginger beer, but I couldn't really taste any ginger. Overall I had a great time and look forward to visiting again! By far the best Mexican joint in all of the city. Excellent drinks and the fish taco is amazing. I had the Mixteco cocktail, so yummy. Cozy atmosphere, exquisite mezcal collection and fine authentic cuisine makes this place my fav as of yet. This place is tiny, but I love the decorations in the restaurant. The waiters and bartender are super nice, the drink was surprisingly good. A cozy, boozy spot for brunch! (Definitely wouldn't come here with more than 4 people)The bartender was great with a positive attitude, although I didn't order any drinks, it was fun to watch him mix them up. They have great Mexican versions of brunch classics like mimosas and ""bloody marias"" so I'll def have to order those next time.They give you chips and salsa while you wait and the music is great too! But the star is DEFINITELY the CHILAQUILES. It immediately pulled at my heartstrings as a Californian and is undoubtedly one of my favorite brunch foods.The chips were crispy, evenly and fully coated with the sauce and the eggs on top were perfect. It didn't look like much at first, but it was actually a lot! I was super full afterwards. My friend on the enchiladas which were also super good. The sauce wasn't super heavy or overly salted.I feel like we waited for our food for a while...maybe like 25 minutes or so but I think they were a bit backed up so it's understandable!I definitely recommend coming here if you're tired of the standard egg benedict/mimosa brunch. What a great little Mexican spot tucked away in the Lower East Side. It definitely lives up to the name. The place is extremely tiny, can maybe serve 15 people at a time at most. If you go at night, you're most likely going to have to wait. Waited around 45 minutes on a Tuesday night, but it is definitely worth it for those fish tacos. Got an order of just about every taco, all were good, but the fish taco is the one that I will definitely be returning for. Also have fantastic cocktails. Definitely up there for best Mexican food in New York City. This is a real hole in the wall place! I met up with a friend visiting from London and our significant others. After a major delay on the f train, I was the second person to arrive and we already had a table despite there being people waiting for seats outside the door. Probably less than 20 people total can fit into this restaurant at a time. The drinks were delicious and I did like the Frida kalo mug. After the other two arrived (both, like me, via the slow moving f train) we ordered a bunch of appetizers and had our meal brought to us tasting menu style. This gave us a great taste of what the restaurant had to offer. Everyone at the table thoroughly enjoyed the ceviche (which was extremely fresh) and the queso (which got pretty messy)which funnily enough was the first and last items brought to the table. I also enjoyed the fish tacos. I really appreciated that they sent out the items in a distinct order rather than having everything come at once and it really seemed to flow with the meal. Our server was also so sweet!! This place has a great atmosphere and feels like you're going to a cool place given the limited seating and intimate setting of the restaurant. I would 100% come here again and would love to try additional items off the menu! I came here for brunch - I loved this little place! Seats only 14 people and it was a cute whole-in-the-wall vibe. I also felt like I wasn't in NY...a quick vacation to Mexico?Ambience: 5-star - Restaurant is decorated in Mexican flag colors and Mexican artifacts. Loved it! It's very small, so get ready to squeeze tight. There's a 4 person outdoor patio and a bar and table area. Food: 4-star - loved the guacamole and the chilaquiles. It was so much food! I couldn't finish the chilaquiles. Guacamole was a bit too citrusy for my taste but my bf loved it. The chilaquiles is slightly spicy..be warned! It wasn't the BEST Mexican food I've had but it was still delicious. I would definitely recommend the place. Drinks: 3-star - I had the Bloody Maria - STRONG! Tequila flavor was a bit too strong for my taste. Service: 5-star - very sweet ladies who were extremely excited when I spoke in Spanish!If you want to feel like you're on vacation, go to La Contenta! Delicious food. Try the shrimp torta - it's incredible and a little different to your standard Mexican place. The Essex cocktail is nice and potent. The Mayan and beer cocktails also great. Bar tender was accommodating and lovely. We had the shrimp torta and queso - both delectable. Wasn't too busy 5.30 on a Friday. Cute atmosphere and a group celebrating a bday, all round good find and experience Omg. Everything was so tasty! The happy hour menu was delicious. We tried the guacamole, fish tacos, queso fundido, and the quesadilla (and another guac). My favorite was the guacamole, but I would gladly get everything again. The queso was just that - loads of delicious cheese. If I were getting food just for me, I'd get guac and the quesadilla so that it's not all just cheese. The place is small but it seemed that nobody had to wait on the frigid Jan 1 afternoon. It would probably be busier when it's not so cold. Service was amazing and all of our food came out really fast. Also, they weren't serving cocktails at the time, and my guess is that it has something to do with a liquor license issue in the new year. I'd definitely want to come back when they're serving cocktails. Cute spot with delicious food! Came here for dinner with my best friend and was not disappointed. Although busy at the time, we were able to grab a few seats at the bar. We started with the guac (just do it!) and then got Chile Relleno and tacos. Service was great and everyone was friendly. Definitely all good vibes.Despite it being a tiny place, we were never ignored or left hanging. If you're on the LES and craving Mexican food, please make a stop here. Came here on New Years Day for my besties bday because we were all craving nachos. I have to say, despite being tiny on space they are large on flavor!! The nachos, queso fundito and of course tacos are not to be missed!! The staff were warm and welcoming on a cold winter night and made every effort to make her bday special!!",https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FwZAyPgdKdPGQ8aAGKh3-w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BkFe_N0Ri2FXiCzoponVWw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/c4GEeNy7AzjXpgdqtthTPQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1-A-s6TrsvL5MLtx1-8RAw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3C4UwHd65tF-ouf_doubYQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cHVaO2irf32KhNcpCf3qjw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UYii1INZAS1rKDPlcNxxbg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Bn-43fBf2a-JeYY6fX5wcw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kIFb4F2XlOk7G-VOR6dqVQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_9Qho0DcIW5AlC79g3mO5g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qNawna3WSQwB-OrTbOjBQA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JOp-WjNVVCishpNbf0DB4w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pjXn5lYLH3_ze744I9Nn2w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/spwavhqG1Jnnn1n2o3enDQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AVWDfsVfLnpA3Udpdt2qaA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zE1yO2JWAb-ZjWIBxq48pA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fLXwbTD5rIf6ElOkp86OLQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WxfRFPZjFREL38o928Gsmg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ksBZCnLN0EtG93Hqm3kGtg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WixxP1tMaxB_BYMiio8jcQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/o8Bp4E0ZrsxidofotR6gVg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QWnvHDwfo-fa2Z3hPBwxjw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Y5U7DNAkTbg_pJddDIzmXg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/btmrVpzZ9syzimZ6kZqbHA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-x2p68sQSKEJs9aWTqiu5g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/laZrjmWn-n23kP-ZXAO-dw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8mhExLttz-qJt07o3LyENA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mWdDSblNyJESkZp4KS9Tpw/258s.jpg,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/la-esquina-new-york-4,la-esquina-new-york-4,New York,10002,NY,Latin American,Breakfast & Brunch,Mexican,"I had the BEST time at La Esquina last weekend. It can be kind of tough to get a reservation, especially only a week or so before, but you can get lucky sometimes the day before with cancellations. A friend and I had an amazing dinner here. We ordered a bunch of small plates and shared everything. Some standouts for us were the tuna tostadas, the avocado ceviche (*****) and the Brussels sprouts of course :) The vibe here is so cool and trendy. You enter through the taqueria at street level and a bouncer guides you downstairs. Downstairs feels like a funky, super hip speakeasy. Stone walls, funky furniture and decorations all around. The tables are tight in some places and the music can get pretty loud at times so you may have to talk loud at dinner but for me that was not an issue. After dinner, my friend and I decided to hang at the bar for a while. The margs here are super strong and not too sweet. You can tell they don't use pre bought marg mixes. The bar area eventually turned into a big party with lots of dancing and an AMAZING DJ. I literally loved every single song he played. I can't believe I've lived in NYC for four years and never been here. Will DEFINITELY be returning soon! Monkeys!! Hmm, so I had trouble reviewing this place because it was a mixed bag, plus other than thinking the food was 'good', a couple of days afterwards I couldn't for the life of me recall what I'd actually eaten other than some tacos! Not a great sign.However after chatting with my dining companions, I can confirm we had the queso fundido (ok), 3 selections of tacos (good) and the chilaquiles (very good). Beer selection was very good.Sadly though, the service was lacking, very tough to get anyone's attention and for about 15 minutes there were zero staff in the room. Very much a look you up and down, judgy mcjudgerson kind of scene. We loved the monkey decor.. as you can see in our highly mature picture! Not sure if I'd return, this place was really hyped up and we were excited to go but ultimately, I just didn't feel comfortable or welcome. This place is very exclusive, and they have several different areas! I came one night for a birthday party and was only let in because I said my friends' name at the door, otherwise you need a reservation! My friend and I were escorted by the bouncer downstairs and another lady led us through the kitchen and into the bigger dining area. The food and drinks were pricey BUT the service was great aaaand truthfully most of the stars goes to the BOMB ass Branzino on their menu. I would go again just for that...Also I would definitely recommend this place for a birthday ! Ive never actually been to the sit down restaurant portion of la esquina. Oddly enough I didnt even know is was there at first. What I can tell you is the taco shop that looks like a delicatessen makes some incredibly succulent tacos. The tacos has extremely deep flavors. The lamb just melts in your mouth. The chicken is packed of flavor same for the ribeye.  The salsas are authentic and true to mexican flavors. My only gripes are that they dont double up on their corn tortillas. One barely holds up if you eat right away and if you wait at all you might as well eat it with a fork. Also mexican corn is rarely worth eating if its not roasted. It makes me so mad that what could be an amazing elote falls short because of steamed corn. Im going to try out the sit down menu as soon as I can ween myself off their tacos...so it might be awhile. I went to La Esquina with a friend on a Sunday around 5:00PM. My friend and I had to dine in the restaurant portion of La Esquina since the speakeasy around the corner doesn't open until 6:00PM. I had the blood orange margarita. It was delicious and our waitress was extremely attentive and sweet. However, the drinks were not very strong considering how expensive they were. Or they just took a little longer to hit me. One or the other. I was in Soho for work and had bookmarked Lombardi's for some good pizza. Made my coworkers trek all the way to Lombardi's only to find out it was cash only . Luckily one of my coworkers lives and works in NYC and suggested La Esquina. I was super bummed bc I had pizza on my mind. Nevertheless, we followed her to La Esquina. When we got to the building I was like ""omg where is she taking us?"" As you can see in pics on here, the outside looks really beat up. I was wondering if it was even sanitary to eat here lol. Anyways, we were seated outside at one of the red tables. It was a beautiful day out but I will say that if you have four people at one table, it's kinda cramped. But we made it work! My coworker recommended the guac and it was great! Very creamy and great taste. The chips were just alright. I ended up getting the chicken tacos with the salsa verde. Overall, I ended up being pleased with my meal. The tacos had a delicious corn tortilla, tender juicy chicken and great flavor (and I'm obsessed with salsa verde and they put a perfect amount on there). I will say though that for $10 you should get 3 tacos instead of 2. I left feeling satisfied but I could easily see someone getting hungry again within a few hours. Overall, I'd recommend it! Very authentic tacos and it seems to be where the locals go, so that's always a good sign! Came to this cute little cafe and sat outside during a great day! We ordered the Chile Relleno, Taco de Hongo, Elote, and Veggie Quesadillas with mushrooms and asparagus. We also had the Queso Fundido with pumpkin seeds which was different than other fundidos I've had since they had pumpkin seeds that were slightly glazed with honey. The fundido game with tortilla chips instead of tortillas, wish they gave flour tortillas.The chille relleno was on the spicier side which I enjoyed, as well as the quesadillas.Elote was on the cob, but tasty with extra lime!Overall really enjoyable, only downside was the fundido became cold quick and didn't give us enough chips as part of the app Amazing hole in the wall spot.  Small menu but tasty.  Had the pollo and pepito especial tortas.  The pollo was relatively standard but very good, and the pepito was the perfect mix of meaty, cheesy, creamy, spicy... fantastic.It is a tiny spot and it has an interesting vibe.  There is probably room for about 10 people inside, and if you are easily offended by loud, explicit music then this might not be the place for you.  I would definitely come back here and try out more of the menu.  My girlfriend and I literally stumbled upon this place as we were walking down the street, and it had kind of a grungy yet inviting look so we checked it out - and we're both glad that we did. OMG! I've walked past this place (and driven past it when i used to drive into the city) about a million times. When everything on the LES/NoLita area is booked solid and people are actually brunching OUTSIDE when it's windy and cold out...suddenly bodega breakfast tacos with a Mexican Coke sounds all right.But it was more than all right. I had an avocado taco and two breakfast tacos (huevos and salsa on soft corn tortillas - simple but it worked). My only gripe: it was kinda pricey for smallish tacos. BUT! It was very good. And i think I'd rather pay a little extra to keep an honest mom &amp; pop shop in business than go to Taco Bell. Looking forward to my next visit. if you're looking for some quick eats and are in the mood for tacos and you happen to be in Manhattan this restaurant is a good bet. Divided into two parts: a fast food service side and a sit down restaurant la esquina promises to give you two distinct dining experiences. I'm giving this place 3 stars because while the tacos are good and the guacamole chip dip is a must order - it's really not the best I've ever had and is over priced at that. To be fair almost everything in NYC is overpriced so that's noting new but for the caliber of food served I can't help but feel a bit jaded. Anyway - this place isn't all that bad and definitely has potential so if you're just looking to satisfy your taco craving then I'd recommend - enjoy! I went in today because it is advertised that they are open at 11am. I went in about 11:15am assuming they are open. Nope. However, I waited patiently for the lady at the counter to get off the phone as I wanted to know when they would be open. Clearly she was stalling because she just wanted me to leave. Instead of asking if I needed help, I was addressed with utter disdain and hostility in her tone as she told me ""Ma'am We're Closed!!!""I responded politely ""Yes, well when would you be open?""Again her response to me was with utter disdain as she told me they were going to be open at noon, offering no explanation as to why they would be open late.I will not be coming back with service this bad. Food was very delicious and authentic! I ordered the mushroom enchiladas and chicken tortilla soup. Both were very soulful and warm for a cold day in nyc. The staff was extremely attentive and nice. My only complain is that when you walk in, it strongly smells like tequila. I guess depending on the mood it can either be a good fun start or reminder of last night regrets. Otherwise I will definitely be coming back for another meal!! Went here with another couple this weekend and was really really good. Very hard for me to give 5 stars but was high quality Mexican. We started off with the oysters, corn and ceviche (tuna and hamachi) tuna was ok, and you could argue not really ceviche, but the hamachi was top draw. Oysters were solid without being spectacular. Hard to stuff up corn. We were sucking down margaritas which I cannot remember the name of the tequila we ordered it with but it was the most expensive and the best. We then moved onto the beef rib, and tacos. We had the lamb shoulder, shrimp and fish. The shrimp was the best for mine, the lamb was slightly above average, the fish again was above average.  The beef rib was really tender, like pull apart style, but the waiter had recommended two rather than the 1 he should have. Doesn't matter though. I think my overall comment is there is a lot of hype around this place, you can't get a reservation etc. it isn't as good as you are expecting though. It is good, and really worth going, but it isn't going to change your life. Food 4/5Service 4/5Ambiance 4/5 (my wife had this weird feeling of light headedness and had trouble getting up the stairs. It was like there wasn't enough oxygen down there. She is fit and healthy, it was weird. Made doubly weird by another woman suffering the same thing when we got outside. They should look into the ventilation down there. She was fine in the end. ) This is a 3 part restaurant.1 part taco stand/taqueria, where you order at the takeout window.  There's zero seating, &amp; zero frills.  The top floor.1 part cafe.  Also zero frills, also on the top floor.1 part sexy ""brasserie.""  Downstairs, down a hall, down more stairs, through the kitchen, past coat check, around the corner.I only did the downstairs brasserie.  And I loved everything about it.It's dark.  It's cavernous.  It's sexy.  It's intimate.  It's loud.  It's fun.  It's a little funky.  It's dark (see pics).The food.  So good.  The cheesy appetizer in salsa was delicious.  The tortilla soup was delicious.  The tuna tartare, the vegetarian app, the carnitas tacos were delicious.  Everything was delicious.  Be warned that portions can be on the small side (sometimes very) for many items.  It's more Mexican tapas style dining.  But items like the cheesy app &amp; the tortilla soup were more than enough for two people (though wouldn't be for three); it depends on what you order.The margaritas.  Order one.  Or three.  I tried the blood orange margarita, because I figured I would be getting a nice dose of vitamin C.  Also delicious.  Also on the small side.  Probably a good thing.This is a spot you'll always remember, &amp; it's equally ideal for a date as it is for a large group.  There's a lot of joie de vivre, a lot of happiness in the air.  You can feel that many memories have been made here.With good food &amp; margaritas.Reservations are absolutely necessary for the sexy brasserie downstairs.  And if you don't reserve enough in advance, you'll be eating at 5:00 or 11:00.  I found it strange that it's called a ""brasserie,"" since this is certainly a Mexican restaurant, &amp; certainly not a French one.  But it's a pretty perfect spot, so they can call it whatever they like.I won't return to NYC without coming back to La Esquina.5 stars. This is a review for the downstairs brassiere area. This place is AMAZING and such a fun time, definitely recommend for groups. The food is fantastic, high quality Mexican food that cannot be beat elsewhere. I'm honestly in love with this place. It also has fantastic cocktails. I went on a Tuesday and it was still absolutely lit, the group ended up just drinking and dancing in the bar area for another hour or two after we had finished our meal. SO much fun! I'm not sure what's so amazing about this place. The wait for a table for two was over an hour on a Thursday night. When they finally seated us, we were sitting so close to the two tables on either side, we might as well have been in communal seating. I hate it when restaurants do this - I realize that it's a bit of a necessity in NYC because the cost of real estate is so high, but I hate it when the tables are so close that you need to move the table to one side to let people squeeze into their seat.I ordered the enchilada and it was ok. The tortilla was good, but the mole sauce was so bitter that I didn't enjoy it. Also ordered the corn that everyone raves about, which I thought was just ok. Is this really the best that NYC can offer for Mexican / Spanish food?If you're absolutely craving Mexican food and want it in a hip environment, stop by. But between the bland flavors, long waits, tight seating, and poor value (price/quality), I would seek another place. Great underground speakeasy spot... huge tequila selection. Great selection of Mexican beers with huge slices of lime on top. Got the queso fundido which was delicious! Came with pumpkin seeds, agave syrup and some kind of powder which made it taste even better. The chicken tostadas were great, a bit small, but rich and tasty. The lamb and brisket tacos were pretty filling, and would highly recommend. Waiter was attentive and service was quick. We had the Mahi mahi tacos as well as the chicken tacos- the mahi mahi was definitely my favorite. The fish was juicy and overall delicious! We had the guacamole as well- I love guacamole but personally didn't feel it was worth the price especially because it was a relatively small portion. As for the service- we had a very annoying waiter that kept being over friendly to the point it made us uncomfortable and annoyed. Overall, I would definitely come back for the mahi mahi tacos- just will probably take them to go! La Esquinaaaaaah! Have you guys been yet?! Flashback to a few weeks ago. The corner on great Mexican food in the city no question. Always on the taco hit list when we visit. It's no non-sense at @esquinanyc. This taco: fresh tortilla with crispy cheese and a tasty slab of thin bistec with perfectly paired salsa verde. Amazing. And they're expanding from SOHO to all over NYC -- did you hear the collective ""hallelujah!"" from taco lovers everywhere?!?  Big things to come... Fun night out at La Esquina! We had late reservations (10pm) to the downstairs restaurant and had a great time. Loud music, great food, and a solid variety of margaritas. We had several of the different types of tacos which I recommend, especially the barbacoa. We also enjoyed several jalapeo margaritas and the staff was very attentive. I loved going late when the DJ is playing and place really gets going. Definitely recommend for a fun night out.",https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YsJ7BWkHFxeijsRrM7RanQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dhpm37ogMqupioqHUGfJqA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/P668oif7YIewysHayJXslg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pfFu3_D-19vQC0tIsoetwg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jKkz15Tda8HNzJK3YS_uiA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/f_1VGg0h4xeH41U-bYK4zA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3Be2FpOmJ0K8bWZmso_bdg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/muaF66lGIClHkRxbLcEgpQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/te1XMkUAwO-5UkKsXOdByw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0wlt5L3Dnp5bX386sm4JAQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ypaYkygh2E-shbDzY5c1QA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/k7hxjv-lGvKkuNJwVZW0mg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/T7EEHOd7LMpcWrCBZfg0Pw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XhvEFo3i--3NAjvMnywpCg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/K7i3GqRK88OrVnGKGnJW2Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jTE85P6r3ISIlWwCkrAYpA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VpNhMxagu2gxU8zriA3NMA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3p0AAsGkjVJqwcI_8IV2gg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/y3hDP-TR5QB_AjAFMvQvlg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/g9eO7XxP-CMLEbhq8g8_Fw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zdBsdEJ-_UWVQebDT3SijQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/aGuM1HtjFXiYVqSsGZt7iw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mhUbT83QuIBklrfRtjLYQA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BgIsNQfX7ME8akKT0f70yg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kYMivyylg-pas6xmiddKTg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/iOI65-yDSDHl8uHV4ue-dg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mOuEepk-I98uizi8_4543Q/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/la-margarita-pizza-new-york,la-margarita-pizza-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Pizza,NA,NA,"I spent my first weekend in NY walking 10 miles in 20 degree weather post-cyclone looking at overpriced walkups, wondering why the hell I moved here from Los Angeles. Starving, I Yelped the closest pizza place and had my answer. New York is the only city where, despite everything, you can walk into any neighborhood and find a slice of pizza that makes you forget everything you loved in your west coast past life. I used to think Joe's was the best, but this definitely took that spot. I thought, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe this just tasted so good because I was hungry that day and it was cold. To test this, I came here multiple nights in a row and still experienced no diminishing marginal returns. Instead, each visit made me crave this place more. The normal/triangular/non-square margarita is my fave. And although a warm slice tastes great while you're walking outside and makes you forget how cold it is, I much prefer to enjoy these in the large seating area in the back to fully engage in the experience. I got the chicken bacon ranch which I didn't like, the ranch dressing used was almost watery and made the pizza surprisingly worse. I also got the margarita with pesto which was a 4/5, the thickness of the slice was between a flatbread and a regular pizza. Yummy pizza! We got the margarita and a bbq chicken slice and both were amazing. Cheap at $7 for two slices. Square slices that they heat up for you. R. is in the building ummm pizzeria.the pizza joint is clean and bright enough. it's on the smallish medium side. it's more of a grab and go spot with the standard set up. i'd recommend stopping by if you're in the area to drink.this is not an average pizza spot. pizza is solid and good. nothing to write to Michelin star guys about, though. it's close enough to the bars in the area and is open late enough...you can your drunken hangry-ness on. pizza aside, it's time to get in the 'ZONE. the CALZONE! the sauseeeeeege calzone is awesome and bigger than your head. it comes with a marinara dipping sauce. the cheesiness melds with the fatty pork and is cradled in a thin munchy cruncy dough. you can't go wrong on with taking a tour through the calzones. the sausage 'zone is delicious. the spinach one as well as the ham calzone are good bets on ending any hunger. wished they did pepperoni calzones though. calzones are all like $8-$9 and are equivalent to 1.5 meals.the staff is efficient and chill, despite sweating in pizza-oven-land. drops mic cuz this calzone is a two-hand mofoi out.zzz Really happenin' spot. They feature the famed Margherita pie as aptly named. They have an ATM inside if you don't happen to have cash on your hands. This place is a favorite among the locals, I came in here tonite thinking it would be slow given its a weekday. Nope, it felt like Saturday night. They have a variety of different pies, some with meat, some only veggies. I had their Margherita slice, but also requested to add extra fresh mozzarella cheese. I can NEVER get enough cheese :D Cash only. 3.5 stars. Informal tiny spot with tasty pizza by the slice. They have a good selection, and you can both get a thin slice from a round pizza, or a thicker square piece. I had a square margherita, and thoroughly enjoyed. The ingredients were fresh and the price cheap ($3.50). There are a few seats by tiny wooden tables, so you can eat there. The service was very nice. Good $2 pizza (but it's $2 before 6pm). For a basic pizza joint (as opposed to specialty pizza and the like), La Margarita is great. We were roaming around LES and stumbled upon La Margarita at around 11:30PM on a Tuesday night - we had just experienced a double overtime nail-biter at Barclays Center and were in need of some fuel after all the energy expended. We ordered a slice of margarita and a slice with breaded chicken, jalapeno, tomato, and onions (and ended up ordering seconds). Wow... The crust was pretty magnificent. If you like crispier crusts, this will no doubt impress. Both slices were packed with flavor, each bite striking the perfect balance between crust and toppings. More importantly, the pizza was NOT drenched in excess oil. Delicious pizza. Delicious prices. Will definitely be coming back for any late-night pizza emergencies.CREDIT MINIMUM $10 - there is an ATM inside Unfortunately the pizza was undercooked and under seasoned. I've had other champion pizzas that were much more amazing so unfortunately this really fell flat for me. I just moved to NY from Boston and have been craving for some pizza. I tried out La Margarita Pizza and it was the best pizza I've had so far. Definitely a must try! As a regular who eats all of the time, my latest visit on Nov. 28 makes me reconsider my options. What I am basically upset about, is when the cashier charged me extra without telling me and when I asked him about it, he realized he made a mistake but instead of owning up to it, he started to become defensive. It gets even worse. As I was about to leave, he threw my change (the extra amount he charged me) at the counter near me which I don't need to say how disrespectful that is. Not going to lie, the food is good. Maybe this was just a miscommunication between the cashier and I but it ended up really upsetting me and I think the shop should own up to it. Unfortunately I didnt make it to infamous $2 slice time.Ordered two margarita slices for $7.And.it.was.good.!!Love the crispy crust, saucey tomato, and fresh mozzarella cheese. Definitely one of the top 3 best slices of pizza I've ever had. Came here on a Friday morning around 130 am and tried the sausage pizza with ricotta. It was around $3 for a square slice. I was so impressed that the crust held everything together so well. The worst is when you pick up a slice of pizza and things start falling off the side but this place cooks it to perfection. The crust was crunchy but not too dense, the marinara sauce tasted fresh, and the sausage added a nice meaty savoriness. I liked the touch of ricotta because it wasn't overly heavy but added creaminess to each bite. Loved this little find after a night out, I would definitely recommend it! In lower manhattan to catch open mic night at the nyorican poets cafe. Left hungry in search of food. My daughter had a taste for pizza. So off we went in search of. We landed here. She's already eaten here once before and said the pizza was good. Well she didn't lie. For late night pizza it was very good!!! The crust was nice and crisp the cheese was not heavy and the sauce was very flavorful. It's a bit of a dive. But sometimes that's where the best food is. The best pizza I've had in NY so far. I got the signature Margarita pizza and it was incredible. The cheese was had a great flavor to it and the tomato sauce was noticeably fresh. At a price point of $3, I would definitely go back to this place. Ordered their BBQ chicken large pie for delivery.  Came faster than i expected.  Delivery guy was friendly.  He was a little confused with our address but in the end worked out fine and i got my pizza.The appearance of the pizza was nice and eye catching.  The bbq sauce was placed in ring shapes on the pizza.  The chicken pieces were cut into small chunks and was not dry.  The pizza was thin crusted and tasted fresh.  Overall, their pizza is of good quality.  Fast delivery.  Would like to try their other pizza and see if it is as impressive. This pizza joint was just down the street from my hotel and had excellent ratings so I decided to give it a shot. I love NY pizza but I also know NY has its fair share of bad pizza joints, so I was cautiously optimistic. I have a rule about the name of a restaurant. If a resturant is brave enough to name themselves after a specific dish then I always have to order that dish. In this example I knew I had to order the margarita. I also went for the pasta pizza which has actual penne pizza on top of it.  The penne pasta was disappointing as it had melted cheese on it but should have had more sauce on top of it. I thought the texture of the penne conflicted with the pizza crust and also didn't add much in terms of favor. So for me it was unneeded texture to a crust that was already perfect in texture and flavor.  My margarita pizza on the other hand was very good. They claim to have a a special recipe and it gave the pizza a nice twist in flavor. The reason I couldn't give this place a 4 star was because my penne pasta was only so so and both my pizza was undercooked and only luke warm.  Very disappointing... went here after happy hour to get a pick me up in the form of delicious margarita pizza. I got both a margarita slice as well as a sausage with ricotta slice, both of which were amazing in quality of ingredients, crispiness of crust, as well as deliciousness. This place is a solid place to get a classic, better than a $1 slice pizza, better than touristy Lombardi's pizza(had it the day after and the comparison was not good for Lombardis), ny neapolitan/square slices of pizza. If this was in the my neighborhood I'd totally drop by to get a slice here and there. All the different types of pizza we got were amazing. Heated to perfection with just the right amount of crisp. The best I've had in a longgggg time! In need of some late night pizza, La Margarita seemed like the best candidate (great reviews and only one block away from where we were).  The pizza is SO delicious - crispy thin crust with an excellent sauce/topping ratio!  I got a Margarita slice (amazing) and a chicken Bleu cheese square slice (good if you're in the mood for those flavors).  Two quality slices for $7... doesn't get better than that!  Can't wait to come back and try more!It's important to note that this seems to be a very popular and packed pizza parlor... space and seating is very limited so keep that in mind if you're trying to grab some slices with a group on a cold night!",https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Aumf7k_VLs3xOatZvx-6xQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5qYzl0WhQjuwhp7nD3ycjw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Zt0lVnhnJrNlshZBNi9bUw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7NH6z9iOZETlq8AKFwkcyQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/88ZsBOfUoJ8uMwB8D2N0AQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6hiY3RwRt86aYqcujFybwQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/N9USNSpu-0qfN7_SqQf3Ow/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RuTZFEuk7bihIJdVo_xsrw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dInSg8nCd4gpYZWCrIqzDA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZT8InI9S9Jq0MpIVo4P8Bg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9XxVl447xRd3U3PdhlaMRw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GjPKR2LEyGKAdWzWvcPYcA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kzYUCCrVhCK4VRxRq8MK9Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5dj087G-d2dcYoLICJ5qhA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Xw8LOa0H7onDF-hDqQ12nw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AXCR53ELgBNueuz5OvD_Vg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GRgoQ6drv4bTOeL0HeTUVQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/o7PARm0WzRZCx3F6U-WERQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lAJZdYfIegZwz6kaufGDvQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/aqdtgLlwiPc5x-snSAss_g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/K5YDiZF1huQTooyRdnceqA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OUTMHdY6NRcvHwtkiIl69g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/o7bqWn0CVvWjSWIwOgF3ww/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/84zCkF7lWkBNWM7qY0la3Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XSBQsmf3XrY8syTcghsD1A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3KgY8ZOnIFh_vEJ4Za24tw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/d9ieb3RDbIDWlAw1QPlHXA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/54Ya6RcVLOvY_QpPeSGTrg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qV-LIQEcgEoUewXV7vTaSg/258s.jpg,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/lam-zhou-handmade-noodle-and-dumpling-new-york,lam-zhou-handmade-noodle-and-dumpling-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Chinese,Noodles,Ramen,"After my first bite, I'm fairly certain that I died and went to carb heaven..As a child of a long line of Chinese chefs in my family, I was hoping for the best. Prices are so cheap, 4$ for 8 dumplings and around 6$ for a noodle dish. I took my first bite of pork dumpling and was so taken aback by the flavors, the juices, the deliciousness of the thin wrapper and the filling. Legit, best dumplings I've had in my life--which is quite impressive as I can't even compare these to my family's. I did it!!! I found the best dumplings in the world.Zha zian mien had loads of noodles and a good amount of pork topping. Noodles were perfectly chewy and delicious. Don't forget that it's cash only!!!! FOOD: 7/10SERVICE: 7/10AMBIENCE: 6/10PRICE: $RECCOMENDATION: 8 fried dumplings for $4This place was pretty good, so far I went to a couple different hand pulled noodle spots and this one was mediocre; the broth didn't really have that much flavor. However the pan fried dumplings were delicious BUT sadly they changed the price from 10 for $3 to 8 for 4. *cry cry cry* I want me my extra 2 dumplings. I love noodles, so any kind of noodle place already has a head start when it comes to me. I got the house special noodle soup and shared pan-fried dumplings with my boyfriend, both of which were delicious and affordable (noodles were around $9, dumplings were $4). Noodles were firm and delicious, as was the variety of meat in the soup.Depending on who you're talking to, things may get lost in translation, but we personally had no trouble getting our food.Side note about drinks: When asking for water, they said they only had bottled water and proceeded to charge us for it, but it's only $1 each.Also, they serve soda in the can, so if you wanted it in a cup like the lady next to us, you'll have to drink it out of a tiny Chinese teacup; otherwise, you'll have to settle for a straw.It wasn't crowded on a Sunday morning, and honestly this place isn't too special. That being said, it's still a great place for a quick, warm meal. While other noodle shops in the area were packed, this restaurant had open tables so I opted to have my lunch here. A bowl of noodles is around $5. The noodles are pretty tasty although my bowl of beef tendon hand pulled noodle soup contained some chunks of pure tendon/fat(?) without any attached meat. Those were not very appetizing and had a coppery taste to them. The service left something to be desired but then again it is Chinatown. My table had no utensils or napkins so I had to steal from the neighboring table. Most of the staff wear their winter coats while working since the heat wasn't on. It's a decent place to grab lunch without a wait but there are better options nearby. Ummm...I guess I'm the odd ball for not enjoying this place as much as others. I like Very Fresh Noodles 10x better!Came here on a rainy day and this place was empty, about two other person were eating in the restaurant. I ordered #2 beef brisket soup noodles ($8). After tasting the broth, I thought it was average at most and the beef was so chewy. Boo!Finally I can cross this off my list of noodles place to try in NYC, but sadly I don't think I will be coming back. Very quick and delicious noodles and dumplings. My friend and I ordered the beef noodles ( number 1) and boiled dumplings. The beef noodles came with some bok choy. One star off because the waitress wasn't very helpful. We didn't have any utensils or sauces in our table and I had to go grab it myself. Also they gave us the wrong bowl of noodles the first time around. Fried dumplings are delicious. The skins aren't too thick and the dumplings aren't too greasy. The sauce is also well made and works well with the dumplings.The House Noodles are plentiful, flavorful, and filling.Service is lacking. You need to work hard to flag someone down. Also water is bottled; you have to buy it or no water for you! Ordered the Lamb Noodle Soup and my mom had the Duck Noodle Soup- both of which were absolutely terrible. I took one bite of the lamb (I'm generally a big fan of lamb) and couldn't stand the taste- it tasted old, super gamey, and was at least 1/2 bones. There was absolutely no flavor. My mom's duck noodle soup was 90% duck neck bones, so rendered inedible. Noodle consistency nothing to write home about either. Dumplings mediocre, lots of chives. I DEFINITELY would not be back. Absolutely did *NOT* live up to the hype for me. (recommended alternative: Tasty Hand Pull Noodles on Pell St).Only pro: it's Clean, since it's a newly renovated establishment. However, half the old tables and chairs were brought over from the old location so it's a weird mix of old furniture + new. bathrooms in the basement. With a new revamped location, had to come back to try some more noodles. Saturday afternoon, was able to get a table for seven right before the place started filling up (it's fairly popular).To start off, shared the Fried Dumplings ($4), Boiled Dumplings ($4) and Sweet Rice Balls ($4). Fried dumplings were crisp and not too greasy. The boiled dumplings made more of a mess; juicy on the inside plus needing some extra sauce for flavor. Rice balls looked more like dumplings and had a distinct brown sugar taste to them. For the main course, ordered the Beef Brisket Cut Noodle ($9.50) - a heaping portion of noodles with big cuts of beef swimming in a hot beef broth. Extremely filling; especially the firm noodles+heavy meat combo.Dropped a star from my last visit because the service took a downturn. Despite the large group they didn't provide adequate utensils or plates. Also, one of the vegetarian soups had a distinct meat flavor in the broth. Want to come back again, but maybe for takeout. I finally made it to Lam Zhou, which has been on my list for years. The pan fried dumplings were good, which is my reason for giving 3 stars, however every thing else was quite disappointing. The restaurant itself looked so run down and dirty. I guess this is your hole in the wall place. When you try to ask for a cup of water, they tell you to get it yourself in the back. The tables are set up in a way to make it impossible for servers to bring trays of dumplings or hot noodle soup to the inner row closest to the wall. I basically had to duck twice in order to not be beheaded by a plate of dumplings and a second time by a tray of hot noodles. The noodles themselves were okay. For the price, I would expect there to be more much more meat in the dish. My friend ordered the lamb and I had the beef brisket. We felt the bowls were too noodle heavy. Also, the broth was not very flavorful at all and needed to be jazzed up with the chili oils, sriracha or unlabeled sweet/vinegar sauce. The hand pulled noodles is relatively cheap and it comes very quick. I ordered the beef tedon noodle soup. The bowl isn't that big but they do give a good amount of noodles. The broth is good. I do wish they had a combination beef noodle option so I'm not just limited to one type of beef.We also ordered the boiled dumplings which comes in 8 for $4.The service isn't the best, but if you want hand pulled noodles this is a quick and cheap option.I think this is cash After seeing all the positive reviews for this place the GF and I decided to stop in on New Years and try it out for ourselves. The experience left me very disappointed. While I did not have the pleasure of experiencing the old location, the new location seems a bit too big. We ordered the following:1x Beef Noodle Soup $7 - Pretty decent. Soup is good. Meat was too fatty.1x Beef Fried Noodles $8.50 - This was very delicious, but meat fatty here as well (same meat)1x Fried Dumplings (8) - $4 - Amazing taste, but I prefer East Dumpling or Tasty Dumping better.1x Sweet Rice Ball (8) $4 - This is like mochi texture, with peanut sauce inside. I love this dish usually, but here they really skimping on the filling.....didn't taste as good as I wished it had.The meat that they use is basically the same for all items. Overall the prices were not very cheap as they were in the old place. So basically you are getting the same thing you got before but much 20%+ more expensive. Additionally, on the receipts it has a spot for ""tipping""... meh basically didn't even get much service and kinda incited us to tip. While I know tipping is optional with it being on the receipt made it feel pretty incited to tip especially since we sat down and ate in the restaurant..... Waters are extra here too so WTF am I tipping for?? Overall not a great experience and will not be back. Honestly, I thought this place was pretty average. The bf has been wanting to try it for a while bc of all of the yelp reviews and we were a little let down. I got the beef noodle soup and he got the beef stir fry noodles. They tasted the same and the beef was the exact same. We also got some dumplings (also the same meat as the soup/stir fry) which was a light spot but east dumpling is still better. To end the meal we had sweet rice balls with peanuts in the middle that were also pretty subpar. Overall I don't get the hype at all. This is pretty much the same as Shu Jiao Fu Zhou but more expensive and better dumplings. Atleast at Shu Jiao the soup is only $3. It's hard to go back to packaged noodles after eating here. BF and I came here on a COLD day in NYC, so handmade noodles in a warm, comforting broth was just what was needed. Dining space is pretty limited, but we were able to get seated right away. Ten minutes later, that was not the case! I got noodles with pork dumplings in soup. BF opted for stir fry noodles. Both were very good!! The dumplings were very flavorful and the noodles... omg. I can't wait to go back to NYC and eat more!!One thing to note-- cash only. I didn't know this and luckily BF and I had just enough cash for meal/tip. Plan accordingly! OMG! This place recently moved to a bigger location and after trying their food we could see why. We started with the boiled dumplingsThe skin was firm and the meat was perfect. It had scallions and pork inside. It wasn't just a frozen ball of pork, you could tell they were handmade fresh. They were also portioned out equally making each bite as delicious as the last. Of course we had to try the handmade noodles. We got beef brisket and tendon noodle soup. The broth was spectacular and wasn't overpowering. It was beefy and perfect for a cold day. It matched perfectly with the noodles, not overpowering them, letting the noodles be the star of the dish. The were cooked el dent. They had the perfect consistency and texture for slurping. The noodles had its own unique flavour that also complimented the broth. The brisket and tendonts were perfectly cooked and again complimented the noodles well. Again the only downside for us was this was a cash only establishment, so we missed out on those points. On a cold chilly day in New York City, a beef noodle soup from Lam Zhou Handmade Noodle &amp; Dumpling is the way to go. Beefy soup broth. Beef is tender and juicy. The noodles are thick and delicious. Also got an order of boiled dumplings, which were super juicy and a lot of filling inside. All that..,Price is very affordable. Can't go wrong with noodle soup and dumplings. So good, I die. The winter freeze was getting to me, especially since I had spent a whole day walking around doing touristy shenanigans. We found this place via Yelp and decided to give it a try. So happy we ended up here. I got the beef noodle soup and Sam got the pork broth soup along with fried potstickers. It was the perfect way to defrost and have a nice home cooked meal for dinner. We barely spoke for like the first 15 minutes, just slurping away and chomping on potstickers. The potstickers were so good that we had it twice. On the first round, Sam was eyeing the last potsticker and saw me narrowing my eyes at him, so he ordered another round. Great boyfriend that fella. Plus, the prices are so hard to beat. Our noodles were like $7-8, which is insane!  The only annoying thing was the door. It kept slamming shut every minute a person walked in or out. Like damn, put some duct tape on the wall to help with the banging. It scared the crap out of me each time and trust me, it's not fun choking on your noodles. New location, right next to the parking lot on Bowery. Inside was very cold. Seems like they didn't turn on the heat but the noodle soups and dumplings will warm you up. They only have pork dumplings. No veg option for boo boo. i order the beef noodle soup with tendon and Boo Boo got the regular beef noodle soup and gave me all her beef. The broth is lacking is flavor. The noodles are soft and chewy with good bounce. The dumpling are great. I would get the 50 frozen pieces for i think $11 and make it at home.Service is lacking so order everything you want including water and drink when the lady comes to you.  Bathroom downstairs. This place is UHH-MAZING! This was my second time coming here and I got lost because they changed their location to a bigger restaurant interior, which is really nice because their previous location was sooo tiny. I order the same thing every single time (because it never fails me!) 1 order of beef noodle soup and fried dumplings for a total of $12! The place is also good for large groups, they have big round tables that can sit about 7-8 people. The service is super quick as they have a limited menu but the food is always hot and fresh!Their noodle soups are so flavorful and for only $7 a bowl, it sure fills you up! They even add some baby bak choy veggies which makes you feel less guilty ;). The noodles always taste fresh and they don't skimp on the noodles that's for sure! The dumpling order comes with 8 pieces for $4, although before I remember it being 10 pieces for the same price but I guess they are growing and raised up their prices a bit. However, I will say the menu is limited so don't expect to choose from a huge variety, it is mostly different types of meats in their noodle soups and dumplings (boiled, fried, veggie, pork, beef, etc.) PSA: They don't give you the complimentary water, you have to purchase bottled water which is $1. Maybe in the future they will change that but still not a huge deal breaker. Lam Zhou is a Chinatown institution that used to reside on the other side of Chinatown.  For a time, it closed and people feared a beloved shop was gone forever, but now it has returned in the space formerly known as Ken's Asian Taste.  Ken's Asian Taste was (for lack of a better term) terrible, so I was very happy when I read online that this restaurant was taking the space over.Not much has changed inside the restaurant in terms of decor.  For instance, while this is now a noodle and dumpling shop, the main counter when you walk in still has steamer equipment for Dim Sum (which they don't sell as far as I can tell).  Also, there is still an additional dining area downstairs, but I don't think it is maintained any longer.  The stairs going downstairs are still a bit slippery though, so use the banister.Service is pretty Old Skool Chinese.  No smiles, abrupt but efficient and quick.  The staff seems accustomed to dealing with both a Chinese and non-Chinese crowd which is great.  This place has gained notoriety over the years and plenty of folks who don't come to Chinatown often want to check it out.  That was encouraging to hear as this would be my first time having Lam Zhou's food (no, really).One great sign is when you get to a table and there is a ton of stuff on it already.  Chopsticks, forks, spoons (plastic ones, and not soup spoons - an odd choice) and sauces including hot chili oil (my favorite).  No need to ask the waitstaff for any extra stuff, it's all there waiting for you.I ordered a soup noodle that had both brisket and tendon.  The broth had a wonderfully rich flavor.  There were *plenty* of noodles.  It is highly unlikely you will walk out of here hungry.  The brisket tasted great and had a good texture.  The tendon was cooked perfectly (read: not rubbery).  I also added an egg to the dish for some extra protein and it went very well with the broth.  The noodles had just the right chew and tasted great (especially once I dropped in some chili oil!).  My girlfriend and I also shared an order of dumplings.  They were freshly made and good, but not the best I've ever had.  They did go nicely with my broth.  She had a lo mein style noodle dish but I did not manage to partake in it.Great food, a Chinatown institution and replacing a bad restaurant?  There's nothing but win here.  Check it out!",https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bYcrgObH3BID8Wu4xbDLlA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/96HHdiYTw3NncgrCGuE8cA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-_7WBmIOM4Lw2bWUfpBZgQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5Sv2rRtkP6KN2kXMPnfXtw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/N54JKtI7Y3cV2CnlNSAOMw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HKcG69mGTHMPMpmwU-KMdQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/eK2athSlhUTjS6UidS-HAA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MSarRve1bkcDF_-57shu_g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JO190yQTI77l7BndsY3ayA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Gn2-tRygv0IT9l6hOv4gkg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cRrXqTCMP07VLH3VpgjfLw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JgdcgOTI5CPUaiYgN-Uk8Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ULkRdfAhZ7gjJnEdbt6j0A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zOqwwJVTVqMBSGSqAjqfjQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HxbrPN1TrzU1CsvRamHXNA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_lk0VnqqoEXsY011lGMb0Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bwvGbcV6YNitziX8HBedwg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9Zez7KTj4lyxtrwliuo-Fw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/v26o7KVorEFJ13uvsl6lCQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Cm3x9DHTxhTjgQNv9ncWaw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IIEWF2hyEqRN0nRlftP9Zg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/iw-HXn1cs1nJAZy9qEAYmw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wNIJudDgAOOauwksemP23A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JjNS2fLRZCOhAM5nooyURg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8iEQjEHhbrwEQsNvnHUmAA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TE-o1P5t_3aeJNiTUW1rpw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LipMG43-VnJ_tH_ElRPZKw/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/l-e-s-kitchen-new-york,l-e-s-kitchen-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Burgers,Sandwiches,NA,"Great spot to hit if you're looking for a quick bite in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Convenient to get to since it's a block away from the East Broadway station on the F line and right by the Williamsburg bridge. A lot of dessert spots and bars near by if you want to get dessert or a drink after. It's a really small spot but ambience is nice. Great lighting and really chill music inside. They use Square so they accept cash and card.The menu is simple and easy to read. They offer quite a variety of options from burgers and sandwiches to sides to drinks. The mint lemonade is perfectly sweet still with the sourness of the lemon to it but not too overwhelming. The touch of mint inside makes the drink really refreshing. I came here twice and here are a couple of the things I have tried:LES Bacon Fries ($7): Fries topped with caramelized onion, cheddar sauce, and bacon. The fries are skinny &amp; cooked really crispy. The cheese sauce compliments the fries really well keeping the dish nice and warm. They don't skimp on the bacon as well.The Kitchen Sink ($12): Loaded Cheese fries topped with roast pork, ribeye steak, fried egg, peppers, bacon, caramelized onion. The portion is huge!! Shared it with two other friends and we still were not able to finish. Every bite was filled with flavor. Mac and Cheese Jalapeo Poppers ($4.50): Deep fried Mac and Cheese bites. BEWARE of burning yourself because they are hot!! A MUST TRY IF IF YOU GO HERE.  The manager was super friendly. Service is quick!! We got our food within 5 minutes of ordering. Definitely coming back to try their sandwiches next time. This spot is one of my go to spots for a burger.Food: Many different options for sandwiches but I love their burgers. I always make it a double and I've tried most of their options. Had the Mac attack with double fried chicken which comes with some delicious Mac n Cheese. The fries are good and  you pretty much can't wrong with any burger/item on the menu. The place is small but has a good vibe as they blast hip hop music and even take request sometimes.  The staff is real chill and make you feel welcomed. Always satisfied when I come here and i recommend trying every burger on the menu. Also, don't be scared to add an extra patty...... you'll thank me later. We were psyched to finally make it here after seeing all of the mouth watering food on instagram.  While the menu is small, but creative and with plenty of variety, I had high expectations in terms of presentation. Their photos on social media depict these massive sandwiches and burgers oozing with cheese or sauce/dressing and toppings.  Talk about mouth watering!  Unfortunately,  what we got had nothing on the photos we saw online.  Take a look for yourselves.  Kudos to management, because they clearly have perfected the art of taking amazing pictures and have achieved 35,000 followers on instagram as a result .I can't completely hate on them, because everything we had was tasty and the girl working was the nicest!  I'm not writing them off by any means, we will most likely be back again. I just wish our food looked as big and mouth watering as what is advertised. My friend and I have been following L.E.S. kitchen on instagram for awhile; therefore, we had been craving their food for awhile. We finally made it in on a Saturday night around 8pm. We were greeted by the guy behind the counter who gave us a few minutes to check out the menu. My friend ordered the kitchen sink fries while I ordered the L.E.S. Burger and the bacon cheese fries. Everything we ate here was delicious! Unfortunately, our pics didn't come out as good as the Instagram pictures but we were definitely satisfied with the taste of everything. We both left very full; I couldn't even finish my fries. We were also very satisfied with atmosphere with the loud rap music playing. It was warm and cozy with lots of good vibes. It's a pretty small space. Only sits about 7-10 people. Thankfully we were the only ones to get our food to stay. Overall, I'd definitely return and recommend L.E.S. Kitchen to anyone in the area. I be cheesing for some mac and cheese balls! I saw the macaroni and cheese balls and I knew I had to come. Unfortunately this place was quite a disappointment. I got the Angry Bird Chicken sandwich and the chicken was pretty dry. Good fried chicken should be moist and tender and crispy on the outside. The sandwich couldn't compare to some of the chicken sandwiches I get in Los Angeles. Also I tried their macaroni and cheese jalapeo popper balls. Fried macaroni and cheese balls are one of my favorite foods and I left some on my plate... that's always a bad sign when I leave food behind. My friend got a hamburger and said it tasted homemade, and not in a good way. It tasted like something she makes at home. However we both liked the tater tot's, but her comment to me was who messes up tater tot's? This place is very small and didn't feel quite a restaurant. It was more like a small shop. This restaurant could probably fit 7 people and that's  max. The only thing I liked about this was there was a place to charge my phone and the service was nice. Even though we sat at the bar, that was pretty much the only place to sit. Lastly there was no public bathroom! It's hard enough finding a bathroom in New York so I usually wait until I arrive at one of my locations to use the restroom. Not many places want to let you use the restroom unless you're a customer. I was disappointed that after I ordered I had to go and search for a bathroom which was hard! I think one visit was enough. Even though the prices were pretty reasonable there's way too much better food out in New York than to waste another visit. I came upon this hidden gem across Instagram and through many friends social media pages. I have been wanting to try this place for quite a while now, and this establishment has exceeded up to my expectations. The food is amazing and came out relatively quick (5-10 minutes)!! The environment is very chill and I definitely needed to point out the music, the music playlist is A1! So far I have tried ""The Kitchen Sink"" and the ""Fresh Squeezed Mint Lemonade"". I would definitely recommend the mint lemonade.  The lemonade was indeed freshly prepared and was totally refreshing. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing but I'd rather have Shake Shack. Everything looked very appetizing on their menu, I opted for their Truffle Shuffle. My group of friends ordered the bacon/cheese fries and two LES Burgers. The grilled portabello mushrooms were underwhelming and the burger was terribly put together. So lucky to have a solid burger joint in my neighborhood. Cozy seating area with fun decor to keep your eyes busy. The forks/knives are even hidden in small wooden drawers which makes me feel like this place values the details. The burger and tots are great. They were exactly what I expected and wished for especially for the price.Go here for a quick burger craving! Came here with a friend the other day and it was absolutely amazing. The food here is incredible. I got a mighty bacon (cheese burger) for $9 and added on some ribeye cheese steak for an extra $3. The burger itself was amazing but the cheesesteak was over the top. Honestly, the bacon was a little excessive so next time, I would go for the LES (basic) burger and add the cheesesteak on top of that. I think that that would be perfect. Also very decent prices for such a great burger. Unfortunately, it does not come with fries, so definitely order the tots on the side! They're so crispy and delicious. Can't go wrong.My friend ordered the mac and cheese jalapeno poppers. They were a little underwhelming. I also have 0 spice tolerance and they were pretty spicy. My friend has a high tolerance and said that they weren't spicy, so I would gauge that its somewhere in between. Finally, I never order a drink, but decided to get the mint lemonade. That was so delicious and refreshing. If you are like me, you can ask for less sugar and it really hits the spot. Don't come here with a large group expecting to sit though. There is one table that seats maybe four people and 5-6 seats at the bar. We came late so we were able to grab some seats at the bar, but I think that most times it is packed. Def will stop by the next time I'm in the area. Probably one of my most favorite meals out in NYC. Saw this place commercialized on instagram before our vacation and made it a must to stop by and try. We got lucky by coming in when no one was there and was able to score the ONE dine-in table they have for 4 people. They have a counter with stools that on fire about 5 people altogether. So just a heads up, the place is tiny! But that's New York for ya. Mac &amp; chess jalapeo poppers - HELLLLLA GOOD and very filling. Don't let those little balls fool you. The Kitchen Sink - perfect meat to fries ratio! And the sauce was so good. Pretty big portion too.LES cheesesteak - not recommended. It was just WAY too much bread and not enough meat. Had way better cheesesteaks other places.Angry Bird - HUGE piece of chicken in the sand which. Bigger the better when buying food!There was so much more on the menu I wanted to try but just knew I wouldn't have enough room in my tummy!! The burgers look/sound really good. Definitely coming back next time in town to try the other items! Walked to this small eatery late Saturday night to satiate unhealthy food cravings. Surprisingly not many people inside (all the counter space was open), so was able to order pretty fast.Decided on the Mac Attack Sandwich ($10) and the LES Bacon Fries ($7). Sandwich includes a deep fried piece of white meat chicken with a scoop of not-too-creamy mac and cheese on top. Fairly basic in preparation, but actually quite good with some hot sauce on top. The bacon fries are extremely heavy, a bucket of hot fries with cut of pieces of bacon and a slathering of melted cheese. All in all, way too much for me to finish (also felt mozzarella cheese would have been a better choice). No alcoholic drinks to speak of here, which is just fine as this is more of a spot you should be sobering up at. More of a 3.5 star place, but bumped up due to speed of service and value. This small low lit little space makes burgers.   A small speaker was adequately playing hip hop and you almost felt like you were at someone's chill house.The place was calm.  On my first visit, I got the truffle burger with provolone, mushrooms, caramelized onions.   God it was good.The burger was oily, dripping,  with the cheese oozing and the threads stretching out, the bun was soft, and not too large, the beef was noticeable pink and didn't taste cheap.  The burger was $9 and didn't come with fries.  It felt like what a burger is supposed to be.Big enough to not need anything else.Greasy enough, good beef quality.Shit.  These guys nailed it. On my second visit, I order just the plain burger for $6.5 and it was much less exciting, if actually ordinary.  The patty was cooked medium which wasn't flattering.  It had that cardboard texture and soy taste going on. The mac and cheese balls were good, but not amazing somehow.  The have jalapeos in them so that's fun. Details There's one table to sit down at, otherwise it's bar space. The space is small, clean, comfortable, newly outfitted and it feels intimate.At 10pm on a Friday it felt awesomely lazy and not obnoxious. It's a simple menu with burgers and sandwiches and a few predictable sides. I was fairly disappointed in this place. Like someone mentioned in another review, the Instagram photos look a lot better than the real thing. I came here with a friend a couple of weeks ago for the first time and I was hoping to be amazed. I ordered the country fried chicken sandwich and she ordered the mushroom burger and overall, it was mediocre at best. The chicken was extremely dry and rather hard and it didn't really have that much flavor going on and my friend, who's never had mushrooms, before concluded that she doesn't really care for them . The fries were pretty good, but not mind blowing. And I also had the mac &amp; cheese jalapeo poppers, which were pretty good but they could've been better. There must be a secret menu or something because I feel like I don't see half of the stuff I see from images listed on their menu. Anyway if I come back here, hopefully on a good day, I'll try a burger instead...maybe that won't be as disappointing. The guy who was working that day was nice though. R. can take the heat, so I am getting in the kitchen...the L.E.S. KitchenL.E.S. Kitchen earned a lot of attention for its over-the-top burger &amp; tots or fries. However I am making room for mushrooms...the ""Panko Portobello!"" This veggie sandwich is perfecto in my opinion. Fried golden-brown portobello mushroom--topped with slaw, pickles, melted provolone cheese, and a spicy sauce. The PAN/KO's crunchiness will knock you out with savoriness. The slaw has that natural flavor and acidic bite. The cheese adds the right kind of meaty smoothness. And the house sauce has a nice kick to it without overpowering. The rest of the sandwich. The soft bun holds it all together without falling apart. I paired off my shroom sando with Mac &amp; Cheese Jalapeo Poppers. The poppers are essentially fried  Mac &amp; Cheese balls that come with a slightly spicy sauce. The fried Mac &amp; Cheese is pretty amazing. Good crunch. Creamy cheesy macaroni. And a a sauce with a little bit of heat. I'd highly recommend you order these to share if you have friends or savage them solo bc you're probably a serial killer. LolPRO TIP: I would recommend visiting on weekdays. Waits on weekends can be cray especially during brunch-ish hours. Weekends are fine just be prepared to do some waiting. The space is pretty small. There is the bar counter that surrounds the cashier/order taker. There are a couple of tables in the front window. The place might seat about 8-12 total. Turnover is fast bc people tend not to linger. Beverage options here are soft as in soft drinks! Lol. Pairing your burger with a Coke is a good idea. Unless you're one of those weirdos who drinks Pepsi. The staff is youngish. Friendly/ish. Definitely worth a visit if you like enjoy deliciously fried comfort food with creative fixings. drops mic cuz this food needs to mover faster into my mouthI out!zzz Very tiny spot but the staff is very welcoming. The burger was amazing and enormous. Will be back when I'm in the city again. I don't know what happened! I've had this place on my radar for a bit, the reviews are great, but the food I received was really disappointing. Now I will say, we came in late on a Sunday. But they were open, and it IS drunk food in the LES. Given all that, it was a bit odd to discover they had run out of bacon. Bacon is a listed ingredient on a LOT of their food, bacon burgers, fries, tots...but fine. They were also out of the Power Pig, something about pig products I guess.I went with a Truffle Shuffle: a cheeseburger with grilled portobello, caramalized onion, provolone, and house sauce. The burger was way overcooked, low on mushrooms, and the onions were raw!! Caramelized onions make even the most mediocre burger good, so that was just another let down.We also got their Angry Bird sandwich and this was another miss. Stringy, tough, with just a little bit of slaw.The tots were solid. Came here on a rainy Friday night with the hangry beau to grab something quick. He got the Essex Street burger ($12), which comes with crumbled tots (ingenious idea!), thin sliced ribeye and cheddar sauce. We got that with a side of fries ($4) and mac and cheese jalapeo poppers ($4.50). First off, the burger was huge, hearty and delicious. It was big enough for us to split since we got two sides with it. A bit messy to eat with the juices and sauces oozing out with each bite but it's a burger and that's how it should be done. I also liked how the fries were cut and they give you a small plastic dish to put as much ketchup as you want. No need to go back and forth asking for more ketchup (: The mac and cheese jalapeo poppers were bomb. I kinda wish it was spicier but all was well. I think we dipped everything we ordered in ketchup and their house sauce, which btw is crack. We asked for more of their house sauce cause one was obviously not enough.I can easily see this place getting packed during its peak hours. It's a small space with one table big enough to seat 4 at max and stools lined up facing the kitchen area. We lucked out and came on a super rainy day so there was no line or wait. The food also came out pretty fast, brownie points for that since we were kinda tight on time.Overall, it's a cute spot to grab a bombass burger. Don't bring too many people with you since the space isn't meant for large crowds. Also, don't loiter around after your meal cause like I said, it's a small space and other people might be waiting for a seat. There was a group of three teenagers hanging out, being loud and obnoxious on the stool area even after their meal was over, which annoyed the crap out of me since everyone is in close proximity and I just wanted to enjoy my meal in peace. Nonetheless, I'm intrigued by their menu and will go back to try their kitchen sink ($12) with another type of burger next time. Enjoyed this tiny burger joint on the Lower East Side. Most people were getting take out but we grabbed two seats at the bar counter and ordered a whole lot of greasy, fried food.I will start by saying that the sides were really awesome! The tater tots...perfectly crisp on the outside and mushy inside. The mac and cheese balls were also damn good. Who doesn't want fried Mac and cheese?I didn't think my burger was as amazing as the sides, though, to be honest. It was a really good burger. But just nothing special! I ordered the Juicy Lucy which is supposed to be a patty filled with oozing cheese. I could see the cheese but couldn't taste it at all. I think the fried and caramelized onions overpowered all other tastes. Also, I had ordered my burger medium rare and it was most definitely served well done. All in all, good for a quick stop but nothing mind blowing. The food is very good. You get a lot more for what you pay for.We ordered the LES burger, fries and the macaroni and cheese tots. All three were delicious, especially the cheese tots. The spot has seating for about 15-people. It's a nice little cozy spot. I'd definitely recommend. Super friendly staff. I live right above the store and sometimes I  get lazy and they're are always so nice about bringing the food to me. They renovated the space and now they can fit more humans. I love the set up.",https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/D36GNpmKXcmZg1cV2aW0sw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/eJ_-5P8fqG4UlEJoXsW9oQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/J5xBUqdXtgsrHy4TjTjk6w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pDV__4EdaLrFS2n7fFksFw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-b1_elWfAB86N_lLKa3jSg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Lm0wuU3dhSdzR7wOSnidZg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0RAqyQUXLUK4Vl0-JUJWsg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YdvboxfTX-6PL9dW9AVE6g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/17b0zzmRpcPY9x0wM_FlYw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2CLFEkYzYBqvHOablL26Dw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4V3EE354Oy0scJrMFJ8ogw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-CXp6cyQinavOcvUeWOWgA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pmRxZN6QVMX0Z7uOXWVJrg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qVIu6t4tprTUxZCDfC8hfQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SOhLstqxYyV8F7u-JSpSxw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/eOWFnvZdragTOcAb_y8GeA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Y8ziwOY-JgbWKalOUYcD8A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_vgeFhTkWE3-5FFEUC0-BA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Q8kxTfNCOAdoij1YWt0-Gw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qDmnld5-94c4kjDQMdV52w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8qm2PEBu9wi-_TYotqvigg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Nx_UB1_GjoNgkbfBWoDu-A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OmvlerjKDVFjCVWnR8qx1g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YrBry52kIHUbE9EjUzvhww/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-5D48gRbWLLHZTBE-MehVw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/O53wWyQe9ExN9vTUuSFYJw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/C7GZtV667iLy33aGBDOnNA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/E7pmndRqsFZzSL15UuLjpQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KfTuPdyHd6l7NP-MY4RUng/258s.jpg,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/ling-kee-beef-jerky-new-york,ling-kee-beef-jerky-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Chinese,Barbeque,NA,"If you love Beef Jerky like me, then this is the spot in NYC!  Their Jerky are made fresh, so you better get their early before they are sold out on some of their different variety of Jerky flavor.  I got there around 4ish and they were sold out on some of the jerky.  The lady let us try a sample of a few items and they were delicious.  I ended up getting the spicy beef jerky and it was perfect and tender not as hard as packaged jerky!  I ended up bringing it back home with me and it still tasted fine after 2 days of not eating the jerky.  Next time when I am in NYC again I am defiantly getting more to bring home to share with family and friends!! You know I'm such a fool for jerkyGot jerky wrapped around your finger ahhahhDo you have to let it Ling Kee?Do you have to?Do you have to?Do you have to let it Ling Kee?I was sent here by my good friend Yael, and she wasn't wrong. They had some of the most interesting and unusual tasting Jerkys that I've ever had. A little sweet Asian flavor mixed with the meat.I'm not totally obsessed with them, but with a cheap prices and how unique they are - and how delicious most people would find them, especially if you like sweet Asian meat - no pun intended - not trying to be dirty - then I will definitely give them five stars.I can now definitely said I've had sweet Asian meat and I've liked it. There are two things I always bring back from NYC: sponge cakes and jerky. I've tried the pork, beef, and shrimp jerky. My family likes spicy pork and the bf likes shrimp. Regular tastes good too, but the spicy has a nice kick. Just spicy enough for you to keep eating. The beef is a little more chewy than the pork. Nowhere close to meat pulp though. I've never tried the ""Chop Beef Jerky""-- that might be less chewy. The owner is super super sweet. Bonus points if you speak Cantonese. Last time she told me her curry beef jerky was selling out like crazy. Cash only and no $100 or $50 bills. If you're unsure, ask for samples! Most tender and softest jerky I've ever had. Seriously. Beef jerky that's tender and juicy? Heck yeah! We passed by this spot shortly after we had already eaten, but the curiosity got the best of us. I got one piece of regular beef jerky and it was the best 2 bucks I ever spent in the city. I want to go back and try the chicken and pork, but alas, we were too full. Yes they do pack it in an air tight vaccum sealed package if you tell them you need to pack it onto the plane. For two pieces of beef, pork and chopped beef jerky i paid almost $25. They charge by weight. However this is probably the best jerky i ever had. Ordered the standard sweet beef jerky. The service was friendly and prompt. The jerky had a pleasant texture more juicy and tender than convenience store packaged jerky. The jerky was sweet and savoury. It was 3mm in thickness. For a snack, this is a nice quick treat. A very pleasant surprise snack discovered when I needed one the most. Super friendly owner and very delicious, unique-flavored jerky. In Chinatown for a day hangout.  Visited this place for some fresh Malaysian jerkies.  Two ladies assisted us and offering us samples before us making our purchase. Great flavorful and tender jerkies. But we cannot tell why they are Malaysian jerkies.  I do not find them any different from any Asian jerkies. Still love them to pieces.  Spicy ones are just as tasty as the regular ones. I would go back again and again if I  am around the neighborhood. Pros:- 6-7 varieties of jerky - Spicy and regular options - Regular jerkies were sweet and delicious. Haven't tried the spicy options but I'm pretty sure they're awesome as well! Cons: Can be a bit on the pricy side. 1/4 pound brings you 3 jerkies. Would definitely be back in the future! I went to this place with a friend who was raving about Malaysian Beef Jerky she had that was super soft and juicy. She happened to find one place in Chinatown. Note that this is NOT the dry beef jerky you find at the grocery store. It tastes like real meat (and it sure is real) with super tasty seasoning. $5.00 per 1/4 pound for most of their choices. (Look at my picture for pricing.) The lady there was so sweet. Knowing that it was out first time, she gave us a sample. What can I say that haven't been said?  Not much, but this is my first time there.Asked to get a sample of pork, spicy pork, and spicy chicken.  Got a sample of each at a good enough size for me to get a good taste.Ordered some pork and spicy chicken jerky.  The spiciness seem to vary with each bite.  Some bites I didn't taste much spiciness, but some others had a nice kick.I will be back to try the rest.Yums The best beef and pork jerky I've ever had is from here. This little hole in the wall is seriously jerky heaven. Their fresh jerky are tender, moist and flavorful, it will literally melt in your mouth. Unlike the packaged jerky, theirs aren't chewy nor dry. They also offer many different flavors and meats to choose from like pork, beef, chicken and shrimp. Although the prices are quite high compared to American/Chinese packaged jerky or should I say, there is no comparison, this is fresh stuff so you get what you pay for. Every time I come here, I always end up getting at least a pound or two of jerky for myself or a couple of pounds for gifting, which they vacuum seal the jerky for you so it stays fresh.  The staff are super nice and accommodating even when you ask for a specific dollar amount of jerky instead of their traditional quarter, half or 1 pound increments. A pound for $20/$21 gets you a good 9-10 slices and I highly recommend the spicy pork or beef jerky, chopped if you prefer it more tender, otherwise stick with the regular. At first you might feel like what is a beef jerky place doing in the list and whats so great about jerky but trust me this place is the best hidden gem ever. We actually don't even eat beef but they had al kinds of jerkies beef, pork chicken and fish. It was Malaysian style jerky which is completed different than the regular jerky. When you think of jerky you think hard dry and chewy piece of meat but the jerky here are so tender, juicy and fatty and they grill it on charcoal to give a barbecue flavor.  Everyone need to try it. Found this gem last year when I trod into Chinatown based on other Yelper's reviews and I have not been back to Malaysia Beef Jerky store since. Ling Kee's beef jerky is the real deal. Taste wise, it is as close as it gets to beef jerky you will find in Malaysia. What sets Ling Kee apart aside from the taste is their skills in grilling the meat.While others may not know, the Malaysian beef jerky is usually grilled over charcoal and you want to see a slight char and caramelization all over the meat. To achieve that perfection, the cook has to spent time to ensure the meat is well grilled over medium heat and not burnt.The other jerky place in Chinatown just don't want to spend the time grilling the meat, thus resulting in no caramelization to their beef jerky. At $21/lb for beef and $20/lb for pork, chicken and shrimp- I thought it's fair. Get the sliced beef or pork. I prefer it over the ground meat version. You can also get them spicy. Absolutely amazing jerky! So fresh, juicy... I don't think I'm ever going for store bought jerky ever again! This little shop that sell jerky is amazingly good! I just went in and point at which jerky I wanted and she heated up the jerky for me right then and there. The jerky was nicely seasoned with a kick of spice. Next time when I come, I would buy a lot more to buy back for my family. Best Malaysian beef jerky in New York. Comparable or less than other places per pound. I've been coming here for years - it's a tiny little Mom and Pop shop that does beef jerky well. The meats are tender with the right amount of sauce and the spicy flavors aren't overwhelmingly hot. It's a chewy, tender piece of heaven.Came in on a freezing cold day after wandering Chinatown - actually saw New Beef King and thought about it trying it out since it's new but the meat looked old and unappetizing, no sampling allowed and it was $27/lb. So we ended up walking and thank god we did.The shop owner is friendly and offered ample samples. She suggested we try the spicy and non spicy pork/beef. Left with about 3/4 lb of jerky for $16 which was about 9-10 slices. Tiny place but big flavor. Love their beef jerky. 2 pieces will cost you about $5~. It can get a little pricey but definitely a must try :) Super tender and delicious jerky! Chicken, pork, and beef! The shop is super small (no place to sit down) , but the owners are very friendly. Thankfully this protein snack is easy to carry and can sustain you for the whole day! Your tired Leg muscles will thank you :) Two words .Best jerk No.. I meant.. jerky Haha. But literally seriously, this place has the most delicious, soft, juicy, tender, spicy, jerky ever, I mean , I've never heard of jerky(or jerk) being anything like that, have you? I really wanted to try this place out due to my foodie friend mike Chen's recommendations (he's also on YouTube) and he made a video about how delicious it was. It's Malaysian style jerky and they have pork and beef and shrimp even. Lady was super nice even tho I was expecting rude ass service since it's china town haha but , she let me sample the spicy pork and spicy beef. I liked the pork better since it's a bit more sweeter. price: Yes it's pricy it's hella $20 for a lb I mean come on I'm broke always but if you just get a square slice of the jerky, it's around $1.8 and for me, it's a good price and I gues it kind of satisfies me? If not, well, walk back to main part of Chinatown and get some egg tarts haha Will be back, I recommend you too!",https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QzGkN3clCf-apOYicxqK4A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lbY5-3K28GGYTc8LgyY7cA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/sGW98ttzBJhwckwukSE1ng/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RWjkiMy3JpN5IzAazMZyUQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ag_CBtUE-GZXGq4_-21RQQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rxP0UG6FeYpg_3CwBhH5rQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/eUWRArU10bJUz5bedCHNtA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1pf3os3iyBqxgSTvofu7FQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DTc_nTCF_5Vp6t9_HzThRg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9X1ycfA1G95H0MCgATJT3g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cG41knQUwOMdVcqCR79Rwg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Urtp1h-ANx_1jzE-jlSB6w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WiaMoZub64dhpAnVau5nCQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IuAc-nGNZ6H4wD-0hVR6gw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6VfTRH3UBYvtRS0Hs2ncSA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9g46joIhvnxOhPktDqw73A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-Xj7CkcXL3h_3_zHYcqjiA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/II8EGlUyH-6VoA1Ez3n0Cg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gaW7qNHu8pp4QlZYdhkjRw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8S7_zKJr1-Tpp3WM06MR9g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1jcMVteVhGVyl4Dre0AKVQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-pY2fuKnKUjgqOJO2yUHSA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UOsk1mB2XI6r_uUrgCoaZA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Isw-BZwc_8xzKysC7NgfrQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kcVJmqUhR9qQ0sqL1DEQqw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rd2GJnE9CUJdndvXp1raWQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kc_xifW1WRzIdESM-nrhRg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IKkiS9nGgK334lk_CVMlxw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ruNOcJLzqa8tG1I1XHyqPQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_DKl0uhHeTtu9upFBvLrYw/258s.jpg
https://www.yelp.com//biz/lombardis-pizza-new-york,lombardis-pizza-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Pizza,NA,NA,"I am going to be critical here. Yes, yes first pizzeria in the US.  However, not the greatest. One could find better pizza in every direction 5-10 mins walking from Lombardi's. We ordered half margherita and half white.  Toppings tasted great.  Loved the slightly sweet tomato sauce. The slightly charred cheese on the white side of the pizza looked beautiful. But crust was not crispy. The sauce was too wet for the thin crust to absorb well. The crust was pretty much saturated with sauce. Sorry, but when a charred pizza becomes soggy, there was too much sauce. The crust appeared fairly dense, so if the crust was crispy, it wouldve probably been hard.  All in all, the pizza still tasted great. Above any chain or nice pizzeria outside of new york.At $26 for a small pizza was a tad high. And it's not like this is a nicer or a more premium place either. They serve you water and pizza with plastic cups and paper plates.  Even chipotle has nicer cutlery. It's almost like a single slice place but they charge you twice as much because its a sit-down restaurant. I really don't know where to begin. I'm from Oregon and we have way better pizza for 1/2 the cost. Maybe this is just NY, I'm sorry is all I can say. Paying $40 for a large thin pizza with two toppings. I read in another comment, ""you pay for the atmosphere."" I agree. The pizza wasn't that good. Now I'm still hungry since the pizza was so small with so few toppings. Off to Pizza Hut. Way better pizza for 1/3 the cost and no I don't work there. Also if your in Oregon I highly recommend Blind Onion, one of my favorites. Made with bagel dough. One of the best pizzas I've ever had. Thank you. HYPE HYPE HYPE. After taking on the quest to find the best pizza in NY- Lombardi's was the place I was most excited to try considering all the stellar reviews. Boy was this a giant disappointment. NY pizza- big, floppy, cheesy-goodness. Lombardi's- $34 for a pitcher of soda( sodas by the cup are $3-no refills) and a small regular pizza with 6 child-size slices, three spots of cheese, and an overall okay pizza. Go check out Artichoke Pizza if you truly want an amazing life changing slice. Btw- make sure to check out the same picture of buddy from cake boss plastered on the Lombardi's walls about 45 times for clout. What we got:- small pizza (6 slices)- half white half margherita- add. sausage on the margherita side and add. pancetta on the white side What we thought:- white was better than margherita- add a topping for the white to balance out the heavy flavors- perfectly baked crust (love that coal oven)- could be a little less oily- pretty pricey ($34 for 6 slices....)***CASH ONLY*** Great experience! Definitely a place you have to at least go wants to say that you've been. We started with the antepasto plate which was really great seriously get this... Also did a couple orders of meatballs for the table these were also delicious.We did a large white pizza and a large half margarita half Margarita plus sausage. Everyone was very happy. The kids love the Italian sodas as well. Don't forget to stop back near the carryout area and see the original oven from 1905! You are paying to say you ate at the first pizzeria<U+200B> in the United States and they get you for every single dollar while you are there. Those dollars you spend? Cash only here.$30 pizzas and up are the norm. $5 to add a topping. No refills on overpriced drinks.It was cool to say that we went and my daughter thought it was fun but the pizza was just ok, it was nothing special and the service was terrible. Long waits to get in and sit down and then too few staff for the number of people.I wanted to have something amazing to say about this place but at the end of the day, it just isn't that impressive. PROS:- Very good service. Our server was so kind and polite. Lots of smiles from the staff when we came in and during our meal. Very pleasant experience- I expected this place to be smaller since it seems like a common trend w/all famous pizza places in NYC to be extremely small with no seating so this was such a pleasant surprise since we were on a NYC pizza hopping adventure and we had to eat outside for every one of the stops we've made so far and it was one of the coldest winters in the last couple of years so it was great to just be able to sit inside and be warm and out of the 8 degree winter weatherCONS:- None that I could come up with! Great service and great food!SPECIFICS:- Original Margherita = Now THIS is the original NY style that comes to mind whenever you think of NY pizza. The mozzarella was melted to perfection and leaves a long string when you pull away from a bite. The sauce has a sweetness to it, rather than sour like how most red sauces are. The sauce to bread ratio was perfect. There was plenty of sauce but it wasn't deep dish and stuck to the original thin crust style. The crust was thin and crispy although it might have been just a little over cooked since some parts of it was a burnt. Another plus was that it was not oily at all like most of the pizzas that I've had. I didn't feel oily or heavy after eating here nor did I feel overly thirsty from excessive saltiness. OVERVIEW: I would definitely come here again! The red sauce is to die for!Instagram @bowtiebowie for more food adventures! I've never been a huge fan of pizza, but this joint got me going crazy! Of course, when you think of New York, you gotta think of pizza; so I had to find a good pizza joint and I chose this place based on yelp. The inside is like a maze, we walked through so many rooms just to get to our table. Our server was friendly and he worked pretty fast. ORIGINAL MARGHERITA- fresh mozzarella, tomato sauce, topped with grated romano and basil (toppings: beef meatball, coal oven sweet roasted peppers, and breaded eggplant)I absolutely love the eggplant. They were perfect and had such a meaty texture, which complemented the texture of the pizza. It was a thin crusted pizza that tasted very fresh, with hints of sweet and savory notes from the cheese and tomato sauce. The meatballs were very flavorful and went well with the sweet peppers. I can't wait to go back to NY for pizza. Never had I ever had such a flavorful pizza before. Definitely need to come back for more! As a pizza addict I HAD to go to the first pizza joint in the US (est. in 1905). Being a popular place it was packed, as to be expected, but they seated us quickly. Once there, they really nickle and dime us over everything. $8 for a cheap house wine, $10 for a pitcher of soda, $4 - $6 per topping, etc.We ordered a 12"" half and half. Half white and half margarita with pepperoni (which they charged the full extra for even though it was only on half). The pizza took a bit come out which is completely understandable as it is oven baked fresh, but we didn't see our waiter while we waited. Even upon sitting down it took a full 7-10 min before he greeted us. The pizza itself was two experiences. The white pizza was a let down. There was almost no ricotta cheese on it. It didnt have any extra herbs or seasoning. It was just basically a mozzarella pizza. The perfect example of why my husband is so cautious when getting a white pizza. The margarita though was a WHOLE other experiance. The fresh herbs were there, the sauce was tangy, the cheese was gooey and bubbly. The pepperoni was spicy and salty which complimented the tangy sauce and gooey cheese.  It was exactly what you expect in an excellent pizza. The crust was perfect, a really traditional New York style.Again, it was another cash only joint so no points or cash back for us :-( Honestly now that I have experienced it I don't need to go back to dine in, but we would order out for sure!!! Came on a Sunday night with a group of 3 and was surprisingly seated immediately. The clam pizza is the highlight of the meal. Only comes in large size which is 8 pieces. Also ordered the margherita pizza in a small which is 6 pieces. Clam pizza has no shortage of clams. make sure to add the lemon on top, which really brings out the flavor of the clams. The margherita pizza was good, but not amazing. We were seated downstairs so service was a bit slower because there weren't servers or waiters down here very often. However, they did have pitchers of water so that was a huge plus. The highlight of the meal was definitely the clam pizza! Try it! It can be a 5 or a 3 depending on the time of day. A must for any pizza addict even if just to say you've been and now you can compare it to other great pizzas. When you go, and when you do not go is the most important thing to know about this place. The quality of your pizza hinges on what time of day you order it entirely.STAY AWAY WHEN ITS SUPER BUSY - THAT'S A 3 STAR PIZZA.Can't stress this enough. Save yourself a long wait by avoiding the lunch and dinner rush, or if you must, get there early enough that you are one of the first people seated. This is a true coal oven pizza, and the thing I've learned is coal ovens have longer waits due to the need to allow enough time for the coals to reheat before you put another pizza over the same spot. Though it has a much more touristy convenient location, this place has never had the lines as long as I saw at Grimaldi's back when it was family owned. This has been attributed to them not allowing the coals enough time to reheat. Doing this may allow for more rapid seating, but it leads to a mediocre, unevenly cooked pizza during the busier times. That is likely the cause of the many three star reviews posted. I've been here on those days.GO WHEN IT'S SLOW - IT CAN BE 5 STAR GOOD!Perfect time to go here is mid afternoon like 3 PM, or a slow time well after dinner. Slow times are the key because I have had some of the best pizza I've ever eaten in my life here. THE PIZZACash only, No Slices. $22.50 for a large Margherita. It's a sauce heavy, thin Crust, Neapolitan pie. Very full tomato flavor, nothing watery.  Some days the crust is just right, some days it's not crispy enough for my liking, but when they are on it's one of the best. The cheese is spread out in little pools of fresh mozzarella. I could swear they used to put more cheese on these pies. Fresh basil is sprinkled a bit unevenly in small snippets throughout. You can tell just looking at this beauty that it's made with high quality ingredients. I've had the pepperoni toppings in the past and it's the good stuff that curls up into tiny little cups in the oven.THE HISTORY AND LOCATIONYes, this is the first of the Original Coal fired pizza places, but that does not make it the best. I love history, especially the history of NYC so I can appreciate going to this place just for it's importance in food and the city's history. However, it's worth noting that this is not the original location. They were closed ten years and have been here since 1994. Don't expect a time warp when you come see the place. Lots of pics of celeb's on the wall, but other than that it's a dressed down version any other red-checkered table cloth, quick service place in Little Italy. THE VERDICTA solid 5 at it's best, a let down of a 3 at it's worst. Go at a slow time and you'll have some great pizza, but don't make this your one pizza you must eat when you visit NYC. John's of Bleecker Street is much better, and so are Rubirosa and Prince St Pizza right around the corner. Come here for the history just as much for the pizza. At the right time of day it's worth a trip. 2.5 stars, I feel bad for giving it such a low rating but it really was disappointing and just ""Meh.""WAIT - came on a Saturday around 5pm and the wait for us 2 was 15-20 minutes. They give you a little buzzer but it really doesn't have a far range (only near the restaurant).  ATMOSPHERE: The inside seems small at first but when you walk further in, there is another section of tables.  For a larger group it's not impossible but I can see why the wait is long because there isn't a ton of seating and the pizza takes a bit of time to come out.FOOD: I got the small (6 slices) with a half and half of Margherita and white.  It came out in about 10-15 minutes and was hot, but not piping hot where I couldn't eat it.  What was disappointing was the fact that the crust was almost too dry and hard.  I guess it had that ""coal oven"" burnt taste/feel but it wasn't that good.  I prefer fluffy, chewy, slightly crusty crust.  I'm even OK with crust that is crispy like at Bleecker Street Pizza, but this was just not good. On top of that, the ingredients had little to no flavor.  Again, comparing it to Bleecker Street Pizza, the sauce had barely any taste and the white pie was even worse! The white pie had a slight cheese taste but it needed more garlic or something to give it flavor.  I would not pay or wait for this.Overall, not impressed with this pizza. This place is just OK.The first time I visited, I waited for a long time and became super hungry. And when you're super hungry, everything tastes good... even Pizza Hut. So needless to say, I left satisfied.However, after trying other pizzerias in NYC and coming back a second time, I now don't see anything special. Surely, not bad, but not extraordinary. Also, $20+ for a small Margarita Pizza with no toppings is expensive for what it's worth.Definitely worth trying since this is the first pizzeria, but there are now also plenty of other options. Very touristy, pricey, but fast service. This restaurant is very old school or simplistic. Cash only, the waiter writes down the orders on a piece of paper, and paper napkins. There is not much seating so naturally there was a line before the restaurant opened. Food: Margherita pizza- the crust was more burnt than I usually like. The mozzarella cheese was excellent but the toppings were overall nothing special. I would have liked more basil and cheese so I can't see the sauce underneath. Overall the pizza was fine but nothing I will crave in the future. When in New York, pizza is a must, right?! Lombardi seemed to pop up a lot, so obviously it was on my to-eat list. From the reviews I read on Yelp, it seemed like a half margherita half white pizza was going to be the thing to try. When they brought out the paper plates, I thought to myself, 'ok, this is just part of the experience- the pizza is going to blow me away anyways, and the plates won't matter'. The pizza came out on a raised pizza tray. First bite into the white pizza.....it was ok, maybe not my thing. Into the margherita....still not blown away. The pizza was extremely thin, with barely any toppings. Lets just say there's a bit too much hype for Lombardi's (IMO). For the price I paid that night, I could have gotten some street pizza and been even more happy! By far one of my favorite pizza places in NYC! The pizza dough is baked to perfection. The toppings are ample, cheese are a higher quality and tomatoes sauce is on point. I would highly recommend this place. All hype. There's only 4 kinda of pizzas on the menu, none include pepperoni. No refills on sodas or teas either (why??). The small 6 slice Margherita we got was over $21 then an additional $4 for pep. We got it after a really long wait and, sadly, it was nothing special. We tried about 10 different pizza places during our stay and this was one of the blandest, most unimpressive ones we had. Anyway it's cool to try I guess for the history behind the pizzeria but they lack flavor. The service was pretty good so 2 stars. Great pizza for the price. I love a short menu, to me that shows confidence that the place does a few things, but they do it really really well!We ordered a small half ricotta pizza and half Margarita (with added toppings).The ricotta overpowered and was very heavy and filling!I would personally recommend the the Margarita over the ricotta but it was a good experience. Be careful of the serving sizes! It was a bitter and rainy night in lower manhattan and I wanted pizza.  Although Prince Street Pizza was only down the street, I was up for something new and decided to walk the extra two or three blocks to see what the rave was about at Lombardi's. I have no regrets but it is slightly expensive. I got the calzone, and with a tip it was $19 to be filled which felt spend although the ricotta cheese inside was soft but not overwhelming. It was cool because in the calzone you can pick any two toppings (even two premiums, so I got the meatballs and bell peppers). They went well together especially since the meatballs had breadcrumbs you could taste.  Not your casual slice of pizza since it is slightly spendy but it is definitely a place to bring your friends from other states who think they have good pizza there. omg you guys! the clam pizza is no joke! best damn clam pizza i've ever had! the crust is super crispy and every mm of that pizza pie was covered and smothered with clams!!! i was visiting from cali and just had to have some NY pizza! so glad i did! it really lives up to the hype! i wish i could back the NY just to have another slice!",https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XtCyVQ08bShUv8WdK5B-VA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oUxWrG7HUj93No3qV5AAaQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/f8yLBjYmCwiB3BnfYh8d-g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4Mn-AA4wXqaTGZXNIsJmlw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/85FbydRHbMbT6TXQB7fxNw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Sv6D4SSTgMRJSoEnZm1agg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HV4RTInQMRKMILqbvr6jRQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bIvR5rzWiNEHMC9SJtxPqQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HUUNPziYJ2J3fzdo_pmZKQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CxuExnvQLkdeh3MrAlipJA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7W4qFbGOV04Koxl_jgLf3A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Ijho1jmBScMOlNQU8KIy3Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MPcoXOoallHltFeL7aYbQQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BaGmtmF2wz2_zF6bDf5vEg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/noHGMwZYPsCc_ZLv1_Ul6g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/t3o2RBsMkva-lyZwSWJG9Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Uoc2xRGDGrOp-8GFm4LudA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/P3x0ECT0tMX8iHF4RERwMw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZbVh-UdQ6gGJBLqQXdnuJQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/d3e0GJCAAxcRyebsVPAzgw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7kKzaDCPbbTih_qABo2esw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/C37r38VNNequGr1pUERYXA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nV8BP8K_OVgWJgo-LoffsQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OnMmFQ5cMJjF0fYwCR6pcg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2G3IBGk26Jz2CEvEgsIRuQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/eZVMxxOQYl9_kpGdYv545g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oR9MtPZeuHpZNubo76u89w/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/luannes-wild-ginger-all-asian-vegan-new-york,luannes-wild-ginger-all-asian-vegan-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Vegetarian,Asian Fusion,Vegan,"Tasty. Good service. Clean. All vegan without compromise. I got warm curry vegetables, delicious! Big pieces of potatoes, carrots and broccoli in curry sauce. Taste as in my childhood. Tea is real tea too. No bags, no imitations, just real green tea, light and refillable as much as you want. Will come back again. I'm giving two stars rather than 1 because one waitress was nice. The other was rude. She impatiently took my order and comes rushing over as soon as you finish your meal and comes to collect the check as soon as you sign as if to check how much tips you left...As for the food... everything was overly saturated with salt. It was barely edible and I ordered several dishes. I think the food might be ok if they held back on the saltiness. It's always great to have more vegan restaurants, but please use less salt. My lips were cracking and shriveling with each bite of food. Also it would be nice to receive better service since I'm paying for it. I didn't make any extra requests at all. I think it would be reasonable to treat customers with at least a neutral attitude. Great food. I've been coming here at least 2x a week when I worked in Soho. I'm not vegan but I absolutely love their Black Pepper Seitan.Not 5 stars because I find the servers a bit misinformative this one time. I called to ask for an order to be picked up as I usual do. However, it was on a Sunday and I wasn't aware that they open one hour later than usual. When I got to the place, my usual server told me that I have to wait till they open. Obviously, I got upset because that detail of my order could've been said over the phone. I wouldn't have minded waiting for them to open but now I'm on my lunch break and I wasted my time waiting for my food. Food is excellent, and for that alone I would give five stars. However, I ordered food via a delivery service, and the container was open, with sauce leaking all over the container. I was told that LuAnne's would not process a refund or issue credit unless they could come and pick up the food, which is unheard of considering it is a mistake on their part.Honorable restaurants would issue a refund along with the food. In fact, I have never heard otherwise. Sad that the yummiest vegan option is now not an option, but I will have to find other alternatives. Had the lunch special and it was very filling and tasty. Comes with vegan miso soup and a spring roll with possibly the best sweet sauce I've ever had. Cute little place and love that it's all vegan! Will be back. Vegan Chinese that makes you want to quit meat for good. Literally one of my fav spots for it in Manhattan . I made the mistake of eating there alone, don't do that haha. Get the take out and food gasm in private Hey, you!Are you a vegan?Are you a loner?Do you have a date?Are you a low-key type of person?Are you into the whole wood interior design?If you answered yes to one of those questions, then this is the place for you!This is actually a cute little spot. ( I don't know how crowded this places gets but) In front of the restaurant, there are a couple of seat if you're waiting.I had the lunch special (11:30 am - 4:00 pm) which varies from $8-$9 and comes with a spring roll, steamed pumpkin, and miso soup:Basil Ginger Soy ($9)- Zucchini Asparagus and Bell PeppersMiso soup was more of a seaweed soup but it was still good.One reason I have chosen this dish was because of the asparagus. I was debating between Basil Ginger and Mango soy in Garlic Plum Sauce since they both have asparagus. I had to ask the waitress which she would recommend, and she stated that the Garlic plum dish was more on the sweet side so I picked the other one.Now onto the whole ""omg why did you not tell me this"" Basil Ginger Soy dish. When the dish came, I was a bit confused because I swear on the menu I saw asparagus.. I know I have a horrible memory but I was 95% sure... this dish comes with asparagus. So I dug through the dish and then I asked the waitress. Surely enough, this dish was supposed to have asparagus! The waitress asked another colleague and that colleague spoke to me and had informed me that the asparagus was not in season and that the market price was high... I thought to myself: why did they not inform me when I ordered this dish... Call me crazy but I feel like they should had informed me.The zucchini was bland. Asparagus was missing. Bell peppers and the soy were delicious and marinated pretty well.The coconut white rice was flavorless as was the steamed pumpkin.. wished it had a little salt for a kick.The spring roll was great.Even though the asparagus was missing, I would like to proudly announce that I have finished my meal! A little bit of forcing but I did it! The meal was actually filling. When I had the last bite, I finally tasted the ginger.. crazy, huh? It's like bam, wild ginger appears!At least this place is better than Red Bamboo. Yay.... go.. vegan..I would recommend this place if you're in a small group. This restaurant is pretty small. Mainly tables for twos or fours.Note to self: Do not arrive early to a dinner/lunch appointment with a Vegan because he is always 15 mins late.P.S. Mimi Cheng's dumpling is right next door. (;07262017Review dedicated to Tarzan. Food: Yummy, forgettable Asian food at an Americanized price point. My favorite part of the experience was the extensive menu. I had vegan tempura yam and taro, spring rolls, and Yaki soba noodles. The tempura was good but bland. The spring rolls were delicious but average for veggie spring rolls, and the Yaki soba tasted like barbecue. Sadly, the taste did not live up to the Yelp reputation today.Ambiance: Oddly dark, hard to read the menus in the middle of the day. Small, but that's typical.Service: Very short staffed and slow. It took four minutes before we were asked what we'd like to drink. I felt bad for the sole server in the restaurant today.Overall, three stars. Not sure if I'd ever come back but I didn't hate the place. :) I love LuAnne's. The seaweed salad with a side of rice noodles was very tasty. I also saw the House Bibimbap at another table and would definitely come back to try that. They also serve hot tea in a cast iron pot, and I love that, so I got it twice, kukicha and genmaicha. What you need to know: - this is an Asian restaurant that specializes in vegetarian dishes - accepts credit cards- small restaurant that seats 26 people, not great for large groups - the price point is a tad more expensive than regular Asian restaurants, why do vegetarians have to pay more??? What we ordered: - Crispy soy appetizer $7 - highly recommended! Crispy exterior and the soy had a shredded chicken texture. - Sizzling soy cutlet platter $15 - wonderful savoriness from the black bean sauce. Loaded with vegetables such as broccoli, zucchini, peppers and asparagus and thick soy cutlets. - Malaysian style curry comfort stew $14 - a really disappointment, it wasn't comforting nor resembled Malaysian curries.  I know the menu said it was mild, but bland is a better adjective. Also, there was only one piece of kabocha pumpkin in this dish. Lunch specials here are not to be missed.I ordered the teriyaki seitan which came with brown rice, miso soup, egg roll and a bit of squash all for 9 dollars.  The meal was filling and satisfying!  I will definitely be back.  They have a cute little space for dine in as well-it's quiet and dim and a perfect escape from the loud, busy streets of Chinatown : ) I'll note at the outset that I've been burned by my fair share of vegetarian/vegan restaurants in this city, so much so that I've made it a point to avoid any places that brand themselves as specifically v/v. Either the portion sizes do not justify the high prices or the taste just isn't there. As someone who loves her homemade veggies, I fully understand the struggle in teasing out the brighter, stronger flavors, especially when you don't have the hardier flavor of meat to work with. Still. It's no excuse to eschew any and all salt. LuAnne's has made me a little more hopeful. Plus, I really appreciate how there's some seating that's friendly to situations when you're eating by yourself. Definitely get:1. The house bibimbap. It comes with a small cup of watery, thin pumpkin soup. There's a wealth of goodies in this bowl: avocado, chickpeas, mango, kimchee, and what I only later found out was seitan. I actually liked how light and healthy-ish this was, especially since there wasn't an overwhelming amount of rice in the dish (as a child of the clean plate club, I refuse to leave a grain of rice behind when I'm eating out, even when I know better). The best parts were the mango salsa, seaweed, and chickpeas. 2. Malaysian curry stew. Although it wasn't as thick or savory as I expected, I still ate everything (this is going to be an ongoing theme throughout this review). The soy protein actually paired quite well with the taste of the curry. Shout out for the generous chunks of protein. 3. Thai curry. Yes, I know. I could have ordered this at any other self-respecting Thai place. But I was intrigued by the ingredients: okra, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, eggplant. Plus, the taste was not your average curry - it was a bit sweeter. 4. Watercress salad. This item was a little polarizing: my friend absolutely hated this dish and refused to eat anything more than the introductory bite but I loved it. I also love watercress, that gingery, tart green. They give you A LOT of watercress and not as much avocado or beets to help temper all the roughage. Definitely only order this if you like your greens and you like a lot of it. 5. Chocolate bundt with PB mousse and the banana walnut cashew ice cream. Don't be a fool and load up on the real food because you will miss out on the creamiest, thickest chocolate cake that I've had in a long time. Was it vegan? I couldn't tell and I didn't care. I was meh about:1. Black pepper seitan. The points for this dish actually go more towards the gai lian (Chinese broccoli) lurking under the seitan for being cooked perfectly crisp. I'm gonna be honest and say that seitan and tempeh and all other veggie products that are made up to taste like meat but is actually fake meat still squicks me out. The black pepper sauce helped to mask some of that weird not-meat-but-imitation-meat flavor. 2. Wild ginger macro bowl. I should have learned from my previous mistakes of ordering macro bowls but this was very bland. As it should be, because everything was either steamed or really cooked down. I ended up caving and asking for a boat-load of hot sauce and sesame-peanut sauce.Service was a bit spotty: forgetful with some orders, neglectful of water, but overall really friendly and ready with explanations and recommendations. I loved this quaint spot by Canal. The ambiance was fairly quiet, with some soft music playing in the background. Nice spot for a date. The menu had a variety of teas and other drinks. The food was delicious and fairly healthy. I recommend trying the crispy soy protein and scallion pancakes w/ the mango salsa. If you get there before 3pm, definitely get the lunch special, which comes with miso soup, a spring roll and steamed pumpkin. Wait staff was attentive and friendly. TL;DR: a lot of tasty options for vegans and vegetarians, but somewhat pricy. Nothing special that you wouldn't be able to get at a traditional Thai/Korean/Chinese eatery if you just subbed out meat for tofu.I came here with a friend for dinner and we wanted to try a little of everything, so we split a bunch of appetizers and a large noodle dish. There was no wait around 7pm on a Sunday and the restaurant was minimally packed, which was great because it's a tiny place that I could imagine gets VERY loud when it's full.I started with a miso soup, and we split the tofu skin wrap, spinach shu mai, fried dumplings, and Singapore mee fun. Miso soup: Rich, warm with tons of tofu and seaweed. A small portion but it was only $3.50Tofu skin wraps: Amazingly crunchy and came with a delicious sweet/sour dipping sauce. Filling had a weird pungent aftertaste, kind of like cooked bamboo.Spinach shu mai: Meh. Too heavy on spinach and tasted more leafy than I wanted. Could have added some sticky rice to balance out the spinach.Fried dumplings: WOW THIS HAD THE MOST DELICIOUS MANGO DIPPING SAUCE!! The dumplings themselves were very average but my friend and I literally drank that sauce - it tasted like mango lassi.Singapore mee fun: curry powder + rice noodles = heaven. Peppers could have been cut a little thinner to complement the texture of the overall dish and the fake meat was a little funky, kinda like puffed tofu.Unfortunately, trying all small dishes meant we ended up paying $27 a person for tax and tip, which was a lot for what we got. I recommend sticking with one dish next time you come, which I would if I didn't have anywhere else I'd rather go for the evening. The food here is delicious and a must visit for vegetarians. I have only ever gone around lunch time, and the wait hasn't been long. They have a lunch special which is very reasonably priced. I was just reminded I didn't write my review by the wonderful Albert K who had some similar feelings about a vegan restaurant. First off I am an Omnivore teetering more towards the Carniwhore deep in my soul! Soooo this place was a true revelation for me. I've always wanted to try a ""REAL VEGAN"" restaurant &amp; felt like Long Island just doesn't offer any good choices. So when my friend Applebomb took me to NYC I knew immediately what I wanted to try first. Applebomb is vegetarian, she loves cheese but not much else. But this place?! Whoa! This place put tastes in my mouth that I didn't think could be accomplished without some good meat. But they did!We started with drinks. I got the Lychee Mojito, a little sweet so I asked for some lime &amp; all was good. Very refreshing. Bomb got the BBQ Satay Tempeh. It looked good but I didn't like it at all. But Bomb liked it. Frontseat passed, she had pumpkin soup instead. I ordered the BBQ Seitan Skewers, nothing short of amazing! Really! If I didn't know it was a vegan product I would've sworn I was eating some new meat protein deliciousness. I almost ordered another plate. Then we ordered the Crispy Soy. Sounds simple right? It was, except your mouth was confused. Are you SURE this isn't the best chicken nuggets on steroids I've ever had?! And those sauces! The sauces just kicked everything up another 3 levels! Bomb &amp; Frontseat were full! But I wasn't done! Bring on those Curry Samosas please! Mint Chutney? Yes please! Yeah Bomb helped me finish these off. A wonderful ending to an amazing Vegan meal. I can't wait to go back! And I'm not joking! It was that good! Do it!11-19-2016 It was a warm but pleasant East Village night and the urge to explore this fabled town was eating away at me, and so was ny appetite after a long flight from The City by the Bay...Okay, these were the reviews I used to write in a different universe back when I hobnobbed with Yelp Eliter Starla D. But enough already..Seriously, if my first meal is any indication of how incredible the food at this place is, then I will be back at least once more before my work trip is over.I had the Vegan Bibimbap(Sp?) and it was simply delicious! I then followed it up with the Vegan Coconut Cheesecake wich was just as yummy. I could swear it also had pistacho in it.My next dish will be the black pepper vegan protein dish!Stay tuned!... Loved this spot! Ran in on a Thursday around noon and got a table right away! Super quick service and delicious food! I got the pumpkin curry and It was perfect for a late November chilly day. Pretty quiet, I was able to read and escape the New York streets. Great lunch plant-based spot:) I checked out LuAnne's for a lunch on a weekday. Their lunch specials are great, I tried the citrus seitan over kale and was really impressed. It also came with a miso soup and spring roll which were very good. The hot and sour soup (which I ordered separately) was . Everything was very flavorful and the staff were very friendly. Wow! Wonderful tastes from unknown land, very decent dishes, and crazy variety - we could eat there for few days in a row and never get enough of it. The service is great, and the place is warm and cozy. Who said that Vegan have nothing to eat?! Great experience to bring non vegans and change their mind and perspective.",https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KzhpgLE790BkPdv7DP1KYQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tOJu4CNK4nwh5rrp8dxqWA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0IEo6iXeRpdoRQKfmzz65w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Qsi_OE8QsZDoifQdh98-zg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QpXkDjxq_1gWrneaiDvr4Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Opa6tE0Cd3bMQTAKkeZDAw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qTn83Ob5IZu8FyuncDBQWw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TpgE-xk0_de8wHdi2QMZ0A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IpZZRcRJOoyJQCj5bX7STw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HLM006AZY_FO8PLFHPqAJg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FS9rB5Bj7KK6NJ7ELp55fw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1xCB84ItP-bwU9aZo2JMEw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2b1xiuqSIs4Ry7wyMa3IzQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ITmYIh7wmoVrC3YfyjXF8Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hUm0mnpLC_QuBpOzfyvTAg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QpLf3OgZd1XUXQezU0FWWg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Z-R0He3S5uWbmnPrhLR3cA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/sYK5FXAjsNscvKj6bIfWDg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PWVteVWFlCSZ75JytHZnUw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/feHHMWuepH3hHzL13Q8Bww/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LpW5G4kpPYGEeK3XrLv52Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9h7fYLIKYCdyO_QpSJLsOA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HJTkpFcIPIpCvkaDou9pCg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_r3CTp4zJ4fxLSkljYSnTw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/89fc9r2l1IOLuuXcjljnqA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/eZfxQqIooELvDkn2b-ATRg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RHEmpEK_XzCjmCSce-KSig/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dAREVXI6zBW0JN0UH8nouQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HL1sbDQMbbCloWKqO8ef4A/258s.jpg,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/macaron-parlour-new-york-3,macaron-parlour-new-york-3,New York,10002,NY,Bakeries,Macarons,Coffee & Tea,"Macaron Parlour is your almond biscuit heaven meets a team of amazing staff in Lower East Side. Simon is the lovely co-owner of this shop, with his wife. Everything is made out of love and respect for the community. Forget your faux macaron from Starbucks. This is the real deal. There are so many wonderful flavors here that will satisfy your adventurous side of life. From tiramisu to cheetos (yes), this will make great gifts for the holiday season! I'm so intrigued with the earl grey, passion fruit, and matcha macarons. The earl grey is welcoming with the bergamot flavor, which melts down to a chocolate-ty smoothness. The passion fruit is the perfect bite of tanginess and juiciness. At last, the matcha is a creamy crunch of your latest obsession with green tea. Really. I also love that the Macaron Parlour is present at the holiday markets all over NYC this year. I'm talking about Union Square, Times Square, Columbus Circle, etc. You're not going to miss out wherever you are. It will follow you. And you will die of joy.This store is also affiliated with Meow Parlour - which is owned by Simon's wife. It's super close to Macaron Parlour, just right across the street on Hester. If you love cats, do yourself a favor and meet some of the friendly cats there! Mmmm.. Fig macaron and peach iced tea.I passed by Macaron Parlour a few times and decided to check it out on a hot scorching day cause I couldn't walk anymore and needed to hydrate. So I got their peach iced tea and a few macarons. You can also ask them to make your tea more/less sweet, whatever floats your boat. Even though they have some interesting flavors like cheetos, I played it safe with earl grey, fig, and s'mores. The fig macaron really stood out for me, maybe cause I like figs? All in all it's a cute spot to cool off, chat up with your friends and get some sugar in your veins if you have a sweet tooth like me. I wouldn't recommend coming with big groups since there's minimal seating. I can definitely see myself popping my head back in again the next time I'm in the area. I love macarons! This shops sells many different flavors- unique ones such as candied bacon with maple cream cheese, and the cheeto flavored. Had to try both of them!!! They also sell cute cartoon character macarons such as tortoro, cookie monster, elmo, gudetama. Huge plus plus. There are a few seats in the back to enjoy your yummy treat. In addition to the candied bacon, and cheeto. I also got the fig, earl grey, raspberry chocolate, and the tiramisu. The macarons were chewy and baked to perfection. The unique flavored ones were interesting, probably won't get them next time. The candied bacon tasted like lays bbq chips, the cheeto one didn't taste like cheetos at all- sweet. I really liked the raspberry chocolate macaron and the fig. They were so full of flavor. I will definitely come here to try more flavors!! Lovely cafe and nice service. I appreciate all the colorful, cheerful decor which creates a happy and light/airy vibe. And super good blueberry ricotta muffins with refreshing strawberry basil lemonade. My friend gave this to me when she visited me @ work. I'm definitely buying the totoro design. Just too adorable to eat. Flavor and texture of the macaron was nice. I still want to try the cheetos flavor though! lol While visiting NYC, I knew I had to come here to grab some special macarons of my favorite character from My Neighbor Totoro. What drawn me into this shop was obviously for the cute cartoon macarons but I was really happy to see A LOT of different flavors including hot cheetos-wait what???? I walked out of this place with a box of 6 with no regrets. A big plus is that next door there is a cute cat cafe called Meow Parlour! Came for the character macaroons, but they didn't have the ones I wanted, so I bought a box of 6 instead. A few of them were hard and didn't taste fresh which I wasn't expecting. EnvironmentIt's a cute little shop on St Marks Place. When you first walk in through the door you see all the cute little macaroons. In the back, there is seating where you can order and chill. FoodIt's a very unique macaron store as they sell characters on their macarons. The only down side is that you should call ahead to find out if they have any. They are not always in stock. When my friend and I arrived on a Tuesday afternoon, the only character macarons they had left were Pusheen, and the emoji of the monkey hiding its eyes. We bought the 4 for $10 macaroons- Pusheen, tiramisu, cognac, and caramel. All were very flavorful and tasted as how they should. ServiceThe guy was helpful when we were ordering offering his opinion. I should've called ahead to see if they had unique macarons (Totoro, Cookie Monster, emojis) but I came to find out they had none I really wanted when I arrived...unfortunate but I still had to choose a few to try...because why not.I built the four pack for $10, with rosemary olive oil (amazingly well balanced), sweet corn (not very distinguished), lemon (sweet and tart), and earl grey tea (light and slightly spiced). Not bad for all but probably would call to see if they have the cuter macarons in store...because I think that it's what makes them more special than any other macaron place. The cafe area is quaint and good for even a small study session for students or those who just want to relax or enjoy some reading. Comfortable setting to enjoy a sweet or two! All you need to get is the Matcha macaron. I got four and none even came close to the goodness that was the Matcha one. I also got the Tiramisu, S'Mores and Apple Cider Caramel. There's so many to choose from, so don't get overwhelmed like I did! They're super chewy, if you're into that. I feel like a lot of them were just missing something, but if you do swing by here, again, the Matcha one is the best. I love this place so much. I used to visit the one on ST. Marks a lot and it made me a keeper to the company. The care bear macaron ice cream sandwich is one of the best things i've ever eaten - and I eat a lot! The workers are always courteous and great you with huge smiles. The decor is always clean and sharp, matching the really cute macaroons they make! I do wish that sometimes they would change up the consistencies of the creams in the macarons but overall 10/10 will always come back. Everyone has their own opinion on which place has the best macaron store in NYC, but from the list I found, which talked about top 10 or so specific macarons in NYC, instead of rating a store as a whole. In this list, a Fig Macaron from Macaron Parlour was among the top 10, so it got me curious. We got a box of 6 with our choices of yummy looking choices, of course including the Fig macaron. It is not some ""fig-flavored"" filling, but has actual figs in it. So, I was pretty excited how this infamous Fig Macaron would taste like. It came with Figs cooked in White Wine and Honey. That alone sounded great. As I cut it into half, I could see the juicy, shiny fig filling. It was very moist, flavorful, sweet, and decadent. I can see why this particular macaron was chosen as one of the top 10 in NYC.All the macarons we tried were quite good and tasty, I especially liked their S'mores, Earl Grey, and Red Velvet. I would like to try some more of their flavors. We also had Ice Cream Macaron Sandwiches, which I have actually never heard of before! We chose a colorful one called Care Bear Stare, made with Salted Caramel Ice Cream. The ice cream filling was quite massive, which was awesome. The macaron shell was a bit hard, making it a little difficult to eat it without squeezing out the ice cream to the side. The ice cream was really tasty, nice caramel flavor, very sweet. So glad that I stumbled upon this place while walking.  I spotted it from across the street and had to go in!  Lots of cool flavors and they have the special ones that they seem to rotate thru every so often.  I got a Totoro macaron (*squeeeeeee*) which was their Party Time flavor.  Definitely had a hint of salt which complimented the flavor nicely.  Also got the Apple Cider Caramel, Giggity, and S'mores.  Least favorite was probably the Apple Cider Caramel just because it didn't taste apply what so ever.  It didn't taste bad by any means, but didn't hold up to the name either.  The S'mores one was good for sure, but I would've loved to have some graham flavor to make it complete.  Giggity was my favorite with a great and not overpowering peanutty flavor.The girl working at the counter was really nice!  The only thing I disliked is that the macarons are ""packaged"" in a plastic bag to go.  Better eat them quickly after that or when they get softer in the middle, they sort of slide and then some of the filling gets on the others.  A box would've been nicer, but maybe you get one of those if you order a larger amount.Definitely coming back to try the other flavors!  One day when I'm feeling adventurous, I'll try their Cheeto flavored one O.o You never need an excuse to eat an extraordinary dessert. At.Any.Given.Time!We were walking around the East Village, and we passed by Macaron Parlour. Kathleen D bought assorted box of 6 macarons, which she seemed to enjoy. Personally, I haven't tried any, since I'm not a big fan of macarons, but can you please think of a more indulgent dessert?-Oleo ($2.25.) Moist and sinful brownie with cheesecake-like(I think yummm!) fantastic filling. (sigh)- Goodbit bar ($3.00)Chewy caramel &amp; crunchy peanut butter- white chocolate square.Simply, a killer brownie! What's left to say?-Chocolatey Chocolate Chip Cookie ($2.25.)Nuff Said!- Peanut Butter Chocolate Cookie ($2.25.) This, dear yelpers, is the pinnacle of Cookies goodness.And when it comes to macarons, you have many choices. Cheetos macarons, carrot cake macarons, figs cooked in white wine and honey macarons? At the end of the day, you want some macarons that's going to meet your needs. P.S: if you obsessed with those macarons, and you want to make your very own at home, take the 3-3.5hour macaron class ($100) taught by one of Macaron Parlour's pastry staff.Four and Half Yelps. When you're on a frigid and smelly Greyhound bus coasting down the NJ Turnpike, you know what you need in your possession? A blanket and a surgical mask.You know what else? Macarons from Macaron Parlour. I can't say you'll really get too far with them unless you buy in bulk, but these light, inviting, delightfully indulgent puffs of sweetness will absolutely help ease your travel anxiety.I selected a box of six (for $15) in rapid motion after noticing this place next to Crif Dogs in the East Village. I actually don't remember all six flavors at this point. Red Velvet, Party Time, Strawberry, Raspberry, Dark Chocolate and...something. Nonetheless, they were INCREDIBLE.At one point I glanced over to see Sari A. looking totally confused on the bus. I had apparently consumed half the box before she could look twice! They're THAT good.The shop itself is adorable and even has booths with macaron-shaped (re: circles) pillow backs! They also have a bunch of pretty looking dessert items if you don't like macarons.Love, love, love this place. Will keep it in mind for future NYC trips! Found these guys in Greeley Park and bought an assortment of the most beautiful and delicious macaroons ever created.Super crispy outside and creamy good inside. Flavor assortment was amazing from carrot cake to red velvet to earl grey to s'mores to cheetos. Sold in a really nice dozen container. Great staff and friendly service. Lemon was a particular standout.Went back the next day for an ice cream macaron (red velvet with cheesecake ice cream) and while it was good, it wasn't amazing. Macaron was just as crispy, but ice cream was a bit hard and packed like it came from a factory. Probably not worth the $5 price and uncountable calories.This place is a definite stand out. Omg I had the red velvet and it was to die for. I got earl Grey, vanilla, tiramisu for my other flavors. 4 for $10 isn't bad. Some tasted creamier than others so there isn't consistency among the four I had The Macaroons were great and the staff was very friendly. My favorite had to be the candied bacon macaroon with red velvet coming in a close second. Some macaroons are crumbly while there are some that are chewy, it really depends on what you choose. So, you can use my tactic and just come in multiple times to till you've tried em all! Overall great experience, would come again. e First visit. I tried a variety of flavors and all were good but the smores and salted caramel stand out in my memory. Some macarons were fresher than others, the older ones were more chewy, but honestly I didnt mind because they tasted good. The best macarons are still Mille Fueille on the west side, with its delicately flavored light and airy yummy concoctions! I'd buy here again if I was in the neighborhood. Check my pics.Happy Yelping :) Really cute place on St. Marks. Unique flavors. They have baked goods other than macarons, and they have seating! Reviews for each of the macarons I bought in April 2016 (*Note: I bought them to take home. I put them in the fridge for two days before consuming them.):Matcha macaron: Good and visually appealing, but doesn't taste like matcha at all. The filling melted the fastest of the four that I purchased, and you could really taste the buttercream. Giggity: I like this one. The peanut flavor is really present. The chocolatey filling is nice. Sweet corn: I forgot what flavor this was since I didn't eat it immediately after. It just tasted sugary to me. After I realized it was the sweet corn, I guess I taste it? It's a very subtle corn flavor. This one remained hard the longest without melting (shell + cream). The filling was more of an icing consistency. Winnie the Pooh honey and cognac: This one is a limited time offer, and I took one of the last few for that day! It was around 5PM so be sure to get there during daytime if you want one of their special macarons. It cost more than the others. I believe it was 75 more. Brownie surprise chocolate chip cookie: I tried this because of Yelp reviews. It's quite good--very crunchy and reminded me of Tate's, but the brownie filling added a nice softness inside.",https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lTnmo3GfRJv7SGkprPfYqg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nf7C-939Bg6AIr1j5ReqRQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Kn6YYL5wajESd7UglbkeZw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1RGe2ynqiUjl7qwpSgNTNQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rnnNvSiXSVTnReYarfqQ0g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Bzefwr8OHuqc3Or2jLgIzg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PTm1xV84UYBBbwNTqcoBVQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WcJIsmgg6s_SzQdjl1HCLQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AAyfESyUnOg7hSBnaOq45A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5DzbHhFa2u5AfeqpwCokdQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/iXRPpUXO2YebmiR0c04Rkg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GivXNJdpXT2ayZQykYHJ1w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kGBml-JkUWTDIqAWDhCLzA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OghSGRXU6-d06eYwTMTF8g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vKFt2YnfRKFA6iCYkWClHw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/iRt4lNCe_g0BmvJ0cWrYXg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tCR2Y6HdbGqsx45TbrVMTw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EWDuozjnsqYC4-LWIl0Pvw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GG9hNQVLrWN7GbWsNcbCLQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ISsPyWEGdBQC-pCSeoWbJQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/n00cwyCOwCPFXaAg0WVqkQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1QZmVAxysvC1xAhaZE9Fvw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0-tXVujjYUJqTIgv4afJ0Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/J1iStfYnPNKKyyhBv5x2tw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mncVElsnGj-ZMuMEFb_TKQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DW0-m8jns_rU2KHur_aP1w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NH26qPRmrQsOb6RP_pNnJQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6a2isx0s53DWCMqO6jtIIw/258s.jpg,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/minca-new-york,minca-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Ramen,NA,NA,"This place is kinda cramped. Minca sio ramen: 4/5 flavorful -- I did found myself finishing the soup. one thing I didn't like was the noodle, I felt like it was a little too chewy for me. I like mine a little al dente. The chashu was cooked perfectly -- not overcooked or undercooked. I kinda wish the egg was runny but it was hard boiled.  Plum wine: 3.5/5 I felt like the plum wine is a little too sweet for my taste. I like my plum wine slighly sweet and dry. I don't know if there were any server on the floor that day because I mean I did came in an awk time like around 4pm. But the cook or busser (I assumed) was pretty nice and friendly. so kudos to him! Would I come back again? Yes, if I am around the area. But I wouldn't travel all the way here since I do live so far from the restaurant. Get the Minca Sio ramen, it is so damn delicious! The salt &amp; roast garlic flavor is to die for and they were able to make it saltier for me. The ramen comes with egg, seaweed, some vegetables on top. They replaced the chashu with brown tofu for me.The ramen price is slightly cheaper then Ippudo and similar ramen joints. The place itself was small and tight, making it harder to sit with my bulky winter coat on my lap. Cash only.I love it that they have pork, chicken and vegetarian broth to accomodate all dietary restrictions. You know you've been here too often when you order something slightly different from the usual and the waitress asks you if you're ok...The Shoyu Tokyo Tsukemen is by far my favorite thing on the menu. I am salivating just writing about it. Tsukemen refers to a method of eating ramen where the noodles are served separately from the toppings and broth. The broth is lesser in quantity than what you'd get with traditional ramen, but it is vastly more concentrated. When you dip the noodles, a thin coat is all that is needed for an explosion of flavor. On warmer days, I love to ask for the noodles cold; there is nothing better than the contrast of the cold, al-dente noodles and the warm, flavorful broth. If you have any leftover broth you'd like to drink after you've inhaled your noodles and toppings, you can always ask for additional stock to dilute the mixture. Multiple ramen-loving friends have recommended the spicy miso at Minca, so I caved in and finally stopped by. The place is cozy, to say the least. Tiny shop with the kitchen right in the middle. There's bar seating and a couple of tables, so expect a wait. Everything is pretty barebones and it's cash only.The spicy miso was good (especially on a winter night), but I didn't think it was extraordinary. There were two large chunks of pork (the charred bits were delicious, but part of it was cold). It came with all the extras that you might have to pay for at other places (menma, wood ear mushroom, corn, half egg). The broth was on the lighter side. The noodles weren't noteworthy at all. Mushy and kind of too eggy, if that's a thing.Portion sizes were really good though.It was a decent, no-frills meal. Probably wouldn't come back if there was a crazy wait though. Cash only!This is a cozy ramen-ya, so come early, otherwise there will be a wait.  This was highly recommended by a number of different reviewers and news articles about NYC's best ramen.  Since we love spicy food, we ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen and the Spicy Basic Ramen.  I've had many miso ramens before, but this is one of the most misoiest soup I've had.  Both soups are full of flavor and gelatinous (thick and rich) without being oily.  It is definitely the highlight, since most ramen soup bases are too oily and salty for me.  The chashui is seared with a blow-torch right before serving.  This creates a smoky flavor that melts in your mouth the minute it enters your month.  Definitely amazing.  We also ordered the homemade pork gyozas. It was perfectly pan fried, with brown, crispy bottoms.  The sauce was a good balance between salty and acid.This is truly one of the best ramen places in NYC. I ordered the Spicy Miso an OH WAS IT SO GOOD. You might think that miso soup is not as flavorful as traditional Tonkotsu, but Minca Ramen will prove you wrong. It packs a punch, with traditional miso, but also increases the intensity. The noodles are top class; no complaints there.Now to the best part. The meat. The meat essentially melts in your mouth. You take a bite, and you get hit with a plethora of taste not dissimilar to sex in your mouth. I think the meat, while different, is on par with Momofuku. I've also had the Spicy Tokyo tsukemen, but sadly, I don't have the pictures to commemorate my experience. Also really good, and one of the few places in New York that does good tsukemen.I got hungry while writing this review. Oops, time to go back soon. ***4.5 stars***My first time having Tsukemen Ramen and let me just say - I've been hunting for a good ramen spot that serves this in the Bay Area ever since my flight landed home. The presentation had me drooling and you get so much food! It's basically a deconstructed bowl of ramen and the way to eat it is to dip your ramen in the broth as you go. I loved the concept. You get to choose the thickness of your noodles - thin, thick, or wavy as well as which broth you'd like. I got their Salt and Garlic, while my boyfriend indulged in their Spicy Miso. Both were very good, but I will say not over the top amazing. We were served 2 slices of pork with corn, bamboo, shiitake mushrooms, green onions, and kimchi all on the side. Can you just imagine dipping your ramen into the decadent broth, biting a piece of your juicy tender pork, and slurping down that hot broth full of flavor?! It was heaven in a bowl. My boyfriend is a ramen fanatic and he ordered an extra full order of noodles because he just couldn't get enough! Keep in mind that this place is cash only and very small so during peak hours - expect a wait! We arrived at 10pm for a late night/second dinner and didn't have to wait at all. Service was excellent and our server was friendly and accommodating. Hot tea is served once you finish your meal. If you happen to not have cash on you, they have an ATM machine a couple doors down! Very good, hidden ramen spot in LES. My friend and I came for an early-ish dinner on a weekend night and were able to snag a table pretty easily! Staff was friendly and attentive, constantly refilling our waters and asking if we had questions.We ordered the pork gyoza as an appetizer. They weren't as crispy as they could have been, but were good nonetheless. As for ramen, my friend and I both got the pork broth - me the basic and her the Shoyu. I got the wavy noodles and she ordered the thick. Both were very good! I'm a bit of a ramen noob and always think it's too salty and heavy, so that's also a bit how I felt here. The noodles themselves were really good, though, and I like that all the dishes come with egg. My friend really enjoyed her bowl, and said it was comparable to Ippudo, her favorite! So points for that.Prices were very reasonable though it's cash only. The store itself is small and there is quick table turnover though it's probably easier if you have a smaller party! Will be back. I had high expectations for Minca after reading several good reviews on yelp and I have to say I'm not disappointed at all. We had a pretty good experience.We went on a Saturday afternoon around 1 pm. It was pretty busy but we got seated right away. There are only few chairs so you will have to wait to get seated if it's busy. We ordered miso chicken noodles and the spicy chicken. It's not the best ramen I've ever had but it was pretty good. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable. Overall a decent experience! Cash only &amp; limited seating!I decided to come here for dinner on a Saturday night and luckily there was no wait for a party of two. I've been into ramen lately and it has become a mission of mine to find my favorite ramen place in the city. So far I've only tried a few places but Minca has made it close to the top. The broth here was so flavorful and I loved that they placed spices and sesame oil on the tables for you to add to your ramen as you wish. The waitress saw that we were putting the chili seasoning into our broth and asked if we wanted the house made hot sauce. She brought over some and it was just what we needed! The only drawback is that I wished the egg was soft boiled instead of hard boiled and the charshu was not melt in your mouth like other places. Even though $12 for some delicious ramen here is totally worth it, the search continues! Since it was my first time in New York City, I wanted to try ramen. This place was recommended by a friend of mine (wasn't with me at the time). Fortunately, this place was open on Christmas Day. It had about 20 minute waiting time which felt like forever since I was so hungry and cold...Service was pretty quick, I ordered the pork broth signature Minca Sio...The broth was amazing! and the noodles were even better! The pieces of pork in the soup were cooked to perfection and were full of flavour. Definitely recommend this place... Solid 3.5 ramen place, but didn't blow my mind. I got their classic flavor which was $12. Cash only!! The noodles were a nice texture and I overall enjoyed my meal. The one massive bummer was that the egg was not semi cooked gooeyness I've become accustomed to. I hope they change that in the future. Probably one of my favorite ramen spot I like to go to other than your typical Ippudo or Ichiran, if you haven't try it yet then you're missing out! Minca is this very small and cozy traditional ramen joint located in the middle of nowhere (no seriously, it's so freaking hard to get to!) and you'll have to either get there early for dinner or else you'll have to wait in line as they don't take reservations. At first, their menu may look a bit complicated but hey I always like to refer to the pictures on Yelp and see which one looks good. Most of the options are pretty good, I especially like to get the Basic Ramen with wavy noodles and then add whatever extra you feel like that night. Portion wise is pretty decent, you can also add extra noodles too if you're feeling like you need that ""extraness"". The broth is usually very flavorful, none of that water down shit around here. And last the price is somewhat reasonable, of course depending on what you get. Average ramen cost about $12 - $15 w/o anything extra, not like the outrageous Ichiran which can cost you about $18... On my check-list of things to do in NYC was ramen.  Minca lived up to all my expectations.  Hidden/hole in the wall?  Check.  New flavors that I hadn't heard of?  Check.  Approval from my sister's fiance who lived in Japan?  Check.Well worth eating here as we had no wait, the food was authentic, and appropriately priced.(Cash only though!) I've been to my fair share of ramen places in NY and I always return back to Minca. Definitely a no-frills kinda place, which I think adds to the authenticity. The price is right and their flavors are just right for me-not too overwhelming but not bland either. Personally I don't like ramen places that have super rich broths or noodles that aren't the right consistency, and Minca hits the sweet spot for me. It's a small place, cozy and no where near as fancy as Ippudo or Ramen Lab and best of all there's usually no wait, very little if any. It reflects the East Village neighborhood it's in-it's got a little grit but makes its spot its own. Kambi Ramen on 14th street is their sister restaurant but somehow their recipe and preparation is not on par with Minca, so I always defer to the original. My go-to is the Minca-Sio with wavy noodles with a side of gyoza. Pair it with Sapporo, and you've got yourself a solid meal. The ramen here is amazing. You wouldn't expect much from this place based on the exterior and interior, but I was blown away by how good the food was. I got the spicy miso ramen which I highly recommend. It was also a huge bowl so I was able to save half for lunch the next day. Note that it is cash only. Big fan. Best ramen in the city that doesn't require a 3 hour wait. Its small, so you aren't likely to get in right away, but its not bad and well worth it. I wouldn't suggest going with a group of more than 4 ppl. There's no tables larger than 4 and hard to push tables together. I highly recommend the minca sio ramen for those looking to break away from the standard spicy miso or pork miso. Their pork is divine and unlike most ramen spots their chicken is dark meat, huuuuuuge veteran move. Doesn't get all dry like breast does. Biggest think to know...cash only, so stop at the atm first. Probably the most underrated ramen spot in the LES. In my humble opinion this spot tops IPPUDO! Don't fall for their hype and come here!Humble service, this place is cramped. Don't come here with a party larger than 4 because they won't be able to accommodate. Keep this ish intimate folks! Bar seating is the best in the house!Now on to the food!Shrimp Gyoza: great whole shrimp with tail on; remember to cut the tail off before eating! Sweet shrimp with crispy light gyoza wrapping makes this a great appetizer for those whom don't eat pork! Dunk this in their soy vinegar gyoza sauce and it's a morsel made by the gyoza gods!Pork Gyoza: pork with scallion wrapped in their light crispy gyoza wrapping, nothing to complain about here! Just get it and do yourself a favor from drooling while waiting for your ramen to be served up!Spicy Basic Ramen: holy hell! The fiery red color of this ramen should give you a fair warning that this will be spicy! Some chili flakes did go down the wrong pipe and induced an unforgiving cough! Only order if you can handle the heat without coughing your way to the bottom of the bowl! Spice but that doesn't mean the heat over powers here. You can still taste the heavy pork based soup here. Wavy noodles soak up the broth well! I topped this ramen off with extra egg because hey who can't have enough egg here?Chicken Sio Ramen: I was utterly surprised by how this wasn't a bland disappointment! The chicken broth balanced well with the salt garlic finish. This is a lighter affair than any pork based soup and if you can't deal with heavy this is awesome! I personally loved the broth and probably could down the whole bowl, but sadly this wasn't my order.In conclusion: COME HERE FOR NO FRILLS RAMEN THAT MAKES YOU JUST WANT TO CUDDLE AFTERWARDS! Let the ramen shoyu the way. Tokyo date to this spot and let them experience some of the most savory, full-bodied broth you'll ever get. THe pork is melt-in-your mouth tender. The noodles are on the bouncy to slight crunch side. Miso hungry for this right now. Pretty standard ramen. I got the spicy miso and the broth wasn't at hearty and salty enough which is pretty rare for me but it was still pretty good. I liked how cheap their toppings are (extra noodles are only .50!) And their shrimp gyoza is definitely something you need to try if you're there. I probably won't be back just because the place is cash only and the ramen isn't really out of this world, but the food did come out quickly and the staff is super nice.",https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cnJWodf23aTpaOUZZbgDAw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/A0GRbK9lC58--6_9ONmaFw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NMUJWGwjJxI6rz-zWG_r1A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/sYfljdGdRUxElLvOorfMvw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/loz7mHdRf0GlWS5P1Sngxg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1-sFYgiingvdmcpOLipFlQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MaqOqT-3Dv1U9YLOwJ6QfQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7M4JtVeHhjg91pVVOls6Lw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fEjLfemVR-kOzzwJwaESNw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1Z4Pb735ywA-dxsK173ERA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/d38iZu_D1TVD7KJHmhXOlw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ehX_Y_VYTNao0M-vN1rqDA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/q9DvDa2wUTQy-ODBw-Xgdg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/luem6Ld-jJeHurExJeEKQg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cjyTrPyKAyS8hvBIp55e0A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ayFiBfSKcVcIzQCIFDo8qQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qdcOnMP89SVg20w9v0W3pg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/M2d49EuPl5-afIxysapoqg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lBeW_V8Y8PiJxg8CWXiIhA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Ttjcq3kcojQtfUcxdJL4nA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CZChSOHd7wYnRFN0RyMNfg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/r-Mqp4adM-tBhH_Yg7-v9Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/T988HIKffU8ezNoPZdDOng/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BGscJylXLfIopW3B9exUFg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8jPPUmWvmvLtdfT-vF5z0w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wFy788CYXek2iRBKv66IAw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/16XMldiY0Ou058TWdn7PXA/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/nyonya-new-york,nyonya-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Asian Fusion,Malaysian,Chinese,"I am a huge fan of okra/lady fingers and they hit the spot with this one - their food is traditional and filled with flavors. If you like your chicken with no salt this place isn't for you Eating a cold piece of chicken is usually a reason not to come back to a restaurant, but at Nyonya it's all the rave! A malaysian restaurant situated between little Italy and China town that serves ""Hainanese Chicken"" (google it) one of the most delicious foods in the world (on the CNN list as one of the world's 50 most delicious foods). Although the menu is almost as big as the Bible, don't get distracted, the dish to get here is the ""Hainanese Chicken"". It looks simple and uninviting - steamed chicken on the bone with sauce on the side - but that is only until you try it. It is so tender and finger licking good that I had to convince my next table neighbors to order it as well. My only complaint: they should provide more napkins on each table when giving us such a hard task to eat chicken with chopsticks! (I proudly used my fingers). Usually love coming here for the hainanese chicken, squid tentacles &amp; seafood scrambled egg chow fun. Those are usually are my go to items. Went in about two days ago and ordered the Curry Mee with young tau noodle soup and didn't taste as fresh as it usually does when I come here. Hopefully the next time it will be better lol. Really good Malaysian food here in Chinatown. It's always packed which is a good thing, and it's actually rather spacious so can accommodate all the Malaysian food lovers. Came here on a Tuesday night and had roughly a 20 minute wait (it was faster because we agreed to share a table with other people). Let me start with this: the menu is extensive. I could barely process page after page of food that looked delicious. We asked the waitress what was popular and kind of just went with that. Started with the roti. Delicious, some crispy and some soft, not overcooked. Plenty of curry with potato and meat in the curry as well. This was devoured very quickly. Next came the Malaysian spareribs, deep fried then glazed with a special sauce that was really good with a slight kick to it. My mom is big on vegetables, so we ordered the popular king king veggies. This was quite good, a bit salty but the flavor was unique. Had some spice to it as well but again not too spicy. Our last dish was a tofu dish, mixed with veggies and baby shrimp. This was probably the best, the sauce was great with a hint of soy and oyster sauce, and other flavors I can't quite describe. Overall the waitstaff were busy but still paid decent attention to everyone. Love the food and the place! The food is really good. I came here last night with a party of 9. We ordered 7 dishes and 4 appetizers which we thought would be too much food. However to our surprise, the dishes are all quite small. I think the food is excellent and the price per dish is reasonable. However when you look at the plates you get, its actually not a lot of food. So the price is very reasonable, but you don't get a lot of food in return. So I guess that means its overpriced for what you get in return. Get the house special squid and the half chicken. Cash only. $22 each between 9 guys. Not bad. If you're adventurous with Asian food, this one is for you. Don't expect to order your nasty teriyaki chicken or orange chicken. Nyonya gets the food right. Ordered the following: Nyonya House Special Squid: spicy squidChow Keuh Teow: noodles with shrimp. Not spicy at all. Nyonya Poh Piah: tofu and bean sprouts egg roll. Simple as that. Squid and eggplant: somewhat spicy with a hint of fish sauce.  I would've given a 3 star rating but we had to ask THREE TOMES for a clean tea cup. And hunt them down for water. Would I come back? Sure. But I have low expectation on service. BTW, cash only. CASH ONLYCame around 1 for lunch on a Saturday and the tables were just about filling up, but luckily we didn't have to wait!Price: 5/5! Opened the menu to be greeted by a lunch menu that starts at $7.99 for weekdays only, so I couldn't take advantage of it. However, most soups and rice dishes start around $8 so I was very pleased, especially since I work around Midtown.Food: 5/5! I had this place bookmarked! I ordered the number 1 rice plate and it was DELICIOUS. The rice is well seasoned and goes perfectly with the chicken and the sardines, which were fried to something like chips. My friend ordered the curry noodle soup and though it was vegetarian, it was delicious. The flavors of both dishes are deep and blend extremely well.Would return in a heart beat to try the other dishes! Reasonably-priced Asian fusion food in Chinatown. Really good tea and yellow rice. The aesthetic of the restaurant is pretty nice. There's a large mix of business people as well as casual people like students. Went on a Saturday night with my sister. When you walk in, if there is a wait, go to the hostess and get a number from them, I have attached a picture of mine so you will know what it looks like. When we first got our number, the hostess had called 41. I expected this to take awhile to get to our number but after about 20 minutes of waiting, we got our table. Not our own table because we were only two people, but we shared a table with two other groups of two. The food we got was:Roti prata: It was basically a big balloon of bread that had a curry soup thing to dip the bread. I like to use bread as a utensil so I enjoyed this. I did see other people using the chopsticks to grab the bread and dip but if you use your hands, you feel like a kid again!Fried dumplings: Were OKAY dumplings. Not the greatest chicken fried dumplings I have ever had but did hit the spot for something I was craving.Beef chow fun: As the picture shows, they were oily and wonderful to eat! The bean sprouts provided that subtle crunch that went with the fat noodles and beef. The marinade for it was to die for because you wanted to dip other things in it. It was clearly not the healthiest food item for you, but man was it good.I will say one thing that was frustrating was how the food at our table which we shared with two other groups was brought out. After about 5 minutes of putting in our order, a Roti Prata got brought out and just put in front of my sister and I, so we proceed to start eating it when in reality it was the pair to our left's. We felt very bad for about 2 minutes because the prata that was actually ours (which they took instead) came out just after ours. I hope they make these things more clear in the future when the people in the table do not speak to each other.Overall: dope place that was not overly priced and had good malaysian food. Just need to clean up the service. Large restaurant with plenty of seating. The downside is that with all the tables, it can be hard to flag a waiter down to place an order. The food also comes out as it's ready and not in courses. Remember it's cash only!Food wise - the roti canai and roti telur are both delicious. The roti is much thinner than you get at other restaurants. Chicken satay was super juicy and moist. For the entrees, the star was the spicy crab #16. It was just slathered in spices and dark brown caramelized onions. It can be tricky to eat but so worth it. Other dish we liked was the fried rice. I would say the masak lemak and sizzling noodles were quite blah. But I would 100% return for the crab and the sweet and salty peanut pancake dessert. Cash only. Good for the adventurous foodie. Having just been to Malaysia, I can confidently state this this food isn't that authentic, but that's not a huge issue with me. Food is just disappointing, but maybe we ordered the wrong things. Spicy squid tentacles - disgustingly fried. Not even one star. Stay away. Seaweed salad - the minor amount of seaweed and mango are good, but the rest of it is just lettuce and tomatoes. Meh nothing special. Hainanese Chicken - I really wanted to like this, but I just didn't. It's cold, which is just weird, but the big issue is that it's mainly skin and bone. The onion soy sauce it comes with, though, is delicious, but it's all on the skin, and most people don't want to eat the skin, so you pull it off, and with it, you pull off the soy sauce, so you kinda have to scrape it up and dip the naked chicken into it, but it's a huge mess and you lose a lot of the sauce, and you're left with cold wet chicken. It's gross. Kang Kung Belacan - sauteed veggie with shrimp paste; this was awesome. Make sure to get this. Couldn't get enough. Kind of a disappointing experience, but I'd give it another try if I'm in the area. Nyonya is my favorite place for Malaysian cuisine! Food is always solid. I've been to the ones in Brooklyn but I think that the one in Chinatown is the best. The menu seems to be more extensive as well. I almost always get the same three dishes when I come here: Roti Canai, Hainanese Chicken and Fried Pearl Noodles. They are all really good :) The curry to dip the Roti Canai is always spot on, I would suggest eating this before it gets cold. However, some parts of the ""pancake"" are a little too thin and flaky. Get the Hainanese Chicken with the chicken broth rice. It's sooo delicious, you won't regret it! The fried pearl noodles aren't too oily or bland and not too chewy just the way I like it. Will forever come to Nyonya if I ever need a Malaysian fix! Taking one star off because it's cash only and wait is pretty long during dinner time. Went in the day before NYE with a friend, looking for laksa. Yelp says it is a Malaysian Chinese fusion place and somehow has laksa. The restaurant was busy and we waited for about 10-15min to get seated. Menu has all kinds of Asian food. We ordered laksa, shrimp noodle and stir fry watercress with soy bean sauce. The server gave me a weird response when I said I wanted laksa and he asked again to double confirm...later I know why don't order the laksa here. Super salty, fishy with unappetizing ingredients (cat fish and pineapple.. seriously?)My friends noodle is also super salty. The only good thing is the stir fry watercress... I really enjoy their food, just really salty haha.We were able to sit there after everyone got there (party of 6) . It was a Wednesday night and super busy. We ordered but everyone got their food at different times and they bought the plates one by one rather all at once. They always made sure we had tea! Haha The roti canai, hainanese chicken with rice are my go-to meal. I share that with friend. I feel pretty stuffed after ! The flavor is good, chicken is tender, and sauce is so good I pour it over my rice.Their ice thai tea is good but too much ice not worth. My meal came out to be 14.5$ which is not bad shared. It's alway seems busy so expect a 20-30 min wait total to sit and get food, or longer. Interior is chilly they keep the AC on! It's on grand street so easy to get to dessert places afterward. We ordered three dishes - homemade Roti Canai, Beef Rendang and Kang Kung Belacan. I must say the beef was really good. If you don't mind shrimp sauce, Belacan is a good choice as well. The service was fast. Overall a great lunch. They are so willing to accommodate no meat/fish dairy/egg - you just have to ASK! All in all everything still tasted great and satisfying even though the meal was vegetarian/vegan. Some of the standouts were the roti, vegetable clay pot with coconut rice, Chinese watercress and sauted rice cake! Not too crazy about the vegetarian duck as it was extremely oily. Prices here are great and the meal comes with tea. It's been years since I last visited this place because I found out there is another branch of Nyonya in Brooklyn which was closer to me.I was craving for a Malaysian food (Nasi Lemak to be specific) and all I can think of is Nyonya. Honestly, I prefer this branch since the server are nicer and the food prep is pleasing to my eyes and palate. I also like how they presented the images of the dishes on their menu. Food porn! There is another malaysian place near my work but it is nothing compared to Nyonya's.Soon, my appetite for Malaysian food will surely be back again and I will have the Nasi Lemak of Nyonya as the benchmark. On my future visit(s), I will try out their noodle soup, looks delicious.Selamat Makan! Nyonya is an established Malaysian restaurant that has been around for years.  When I think of Malaysian, Nyonya is the first to come to mind.  The Roti Canai  is a must.  The homemade roti is thin and crispy and the chicken curry dipping sauce is delicious.  You'll want your own so don't bother thinking if you should share it.  I also recommend the classic stir fried noodle dish, Chow Kueh Teow. It's a flavorful, slightly spicy seafood dish with shrimp and squid. Portions are large even for lunch.  They also have a wide array of fun Asian drinks.  I opted for the frosty coconut milk with red bean.  It was yummy and perfect for a hot summer day.  I was with a table of 5 during a weekday lunch and the service was a bit slow.  I say we waited about 20 long mins for our food to arrive.  So beware if you're in a hurry.  Overall, an inexpensive and fulfilling option for lunch. Malaysian Chinese restaurant in the Manhattan Chinatown area. Had a good crowd waiting during Saturday night, but my friend and I got lucky and only had to wait a few minutes for a small table. Insides were packed... just like what'd you expect from Chinatown. We ordered a few Malaysian specialties. For appetizers, we got the Roti Canai (kind of like a naan, but puffed up and comes with chicken curry for dipping) and the Poh Piah (Malaysian spring roll), and both were pretty good. For main dishes, we had the Asam Laksa (noodle soup) which had a slightly sour flavor that opens up the appetite; the Hokkien Char Mee (stir fried noodles) which was very flavorful, and it tasted quite close to some Chinese chow mein that I had before; and lastly, Nasi Lemak, which should have had a bit more coconut flavor on the rice. Overall, the food was pretty good. My friend who is Malaysian said it was the best Malaysian food he had in the US. The two appetizers plus three main dishes came to $45 including tips, which was not very expensive at all. Last note is that the place is cash only, so be sure to have a few bills in your wallet before going. Asian food when visiting New York?!  Hell yeah!  NYC has a strong community of Chinese with many chinatown neighborhoods throughout its five boroughs.When I get asked what was my favorite meal on my vacation to NYC, I respond with Malaysian food at Nyonya!  Satisfying meal without paying top dollar.Our group shared family style and were able to delight on a handful of Malaysian offerings.  -  -  The fried rice had a little heat on it--very subtle.  -  Noodles were thin but with chili flavoring similiar to pad thai.  -  Their Roti Canai bread was paper thin and came with peanut sauce--this was the only dish I didn't really care for.  I like more substance in my roti.  -  The beef Rendang dish was tender and complemented well by the sauce.  -  Mango shrimp--winners!-  Their signature Hainan chicken dish--cold chicken with a sweet soy sauce--delivered on taste as well!  -  Their green veggies (think watercress but not sure)--wow!For the Hawaii folk, think of Nyonya as Dagon with a tinge of heat.When in New York, eat Malaysian!",https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YuWC1Gwo7ku4PvD-7mDQnA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/iXybxoCSQH5axvIDCC-YWw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Sdz4tvnlxENujBwCBEnj7Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lw1m4wLt5n6iBctuYPH9AQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wP_qCqwZBe7IkoMA0sb19Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Je_b7SR4KW8ZBaU_O2_M2Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/G1mYCdjFimoYvFiImHlJ1A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pJMayQi-embV1M7iSJyepw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZKKQkbSmTzxA7o3x6aSBig/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XTbORSpWuGi7Nj3Y6gU-Hw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RnXi2bgOhjDkmVXQTijbPA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/q2I68_vzeFS7VGgaG3PjEQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GroUAPLSNEwTSeihtQx3_A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zgshlk-jriEvFbEhW_4TzA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mWvsS18J2uvdh_T6uGkhEQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2NXa7WFfVPg0uNTfmVeHUA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KJn43Bf1qGFBpfmtHmCTkg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Ffpc7mJRDRJip462N7rsRg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9Evdme7RVBLbCuP8c82BsQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qb1_NWPO6yxheoA27AV_TQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Wrx0GR80Co9nVIAnSsxzIw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Li4gY-2TIw73x_OQ4COcmw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/em-YMJoQKTX_KlxPXDf4Bw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Nh49Q51m5KdEG1nuEF4nhw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_52PVLdhUoAfsHeGfG0boQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2YV0mQgupAWqVw_SvSK4wQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QiokM4A_Kj3jBWnWWFKazw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QslGnase3Xxqxw0MPfMZlw/258s.jpg,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/old-man-hustle-new-york-2,old-man-hustle-new-york-2,New York,10002,NY,Cocktail Bars,Dive Bars,Comedy Clubs,"If you want your arm clamped by a random bouncer walking in, come on in. I'm very youthful and was joining a friend who walked in for a shot. Showed my official California ID, didn't but it, showed my official NYC ID, barely bought it after loads of verbal harassment. Use their restroom for 2 min, friend ended up leaving, bouncer confronts me when I try to leave: ""This isn't a public restroom etc. etc."" last time I checked your job is to check IDs and keep it peaceful. My friend bought a shot, so what's the dealeo? I didn't spark nothing. *EDIT 10/27/17: Rachel is the best bartender and person I've met in a while. All relations mended. Come by to Old Man Hustle! Dropped in for happy hour after a disappointing experience at the Hester Street Beer and Lobster fest and the experience totally made my day. Super chill, divey kind of atmosphere, and the bartender was bro-ing out with us and cracking jokes. Note: don't be me and try to order an old fashioned and then a whiskey sour (don't judge me), because it's a super casual and relaxed place, and they don't have bitters or fresh sours. The bartender took pity on me and made up a fresh batch of sour mix (you go, man!) and we did a few rounds of shots and pours for the hell of it. Happy hour is long and cheap for beers and shots, and I'd definitely come back. I came here a while ago for comedy night. They host comedy nights on Wednesdays. The place is very small and can probably only fit about 15 people max. There is a little stage at the end where comedians can go perform. The vibe is very laid back and everyone seems pretty friendly. When we came, we felt like we were the only ""outsiders"" since everyone else seemed to know each other. Even though we were new, they made us feel welcome and directed all their jokes at us (even made us the butt of these jokes at times, all in good fun). The drinks are pretty reasonable priced too. This is a great divey kind of bar that's pretty nice to go to and you wanted somewhere to go chill. I don't usually go out to bars like this but I would definitely not mind revisiting a place like this if I ever found myself in need of a drink and a nice spot to relax at. The no cover comedy shows on Wednesday can also be a nice way to pass some time if you happen to be bored also. So come here on the 29th of December with my cousin and a friend from Miami and had a great time. Super random night and that up here because I looked for a local bars around the area and this one looked like a cool dive place. the bartender as soon as we walked in was open and nice and try to start a conversation with us that's the bar is extremely small and looks like a local community cool bar. Forgot her name but she's the one with glasses and also does stand up. If she's reading this I am the guy that tried to buy the fish and brought you a donut and a Dunkin Donuts bag. I had a couple drinks got a shot use the bathroom and stay until she did stand up comedy at 8 p.m. The question is was so well worth it? And the answer is hell to the year had a very personal good experience and will definitely come back to check this place out hopefully with the same staff. Loved this bar.The bartenders here are very friendly and cool, happy hour is long and plentiful and they even do comedy shows at 8pm every night (which  I plan on coming back for).This is honestly one of those places that I absolutely loved but can't put my finger on why-I just felt great there and had a great time! Cozy dive bar with great happy hour specials until 7 :) Rachel (bartender and comedian) chatted with us and made us feel at home. They have a free comedy show @ 8 each night, would definitely come back for that when we have time! Thanks! It's a little bar with a lot of heart, and I mean tiny. I've only ever been in for their Sunday night comedy open mics, a mix bag of up and coming performers who in my experience aren't afraid to go dark, blue, or politically incorrect. For such a small space they have a great beer selection (no taps, just bottles), and also make some great cocktails. You can count on good conversation with down to earth strangers here. Bathroom door can be a little tricky, the lock sticks. Best bar in NYC! Liquor beer and comedy! Everyday there is comedy at 8pm. Happy hour till 7pm and good vibes till 2am! Come if you like to drink and laugh. (:Always funny and cool bartenders behind the bar too!! I walked into this place thinking it was going to be a regular dive bar, but it is way more than that.  I ordered a whiskey sour which was great.  There was only about 15 people inside since it's a small place, but everyone was having a good time.  Apparently, it was open mic night for stand up comedy routines and after about 20 minuets the bartender got up on the tiny stage and started cracking some hilarious jokes to prepare for the routines.  I did not expect this at all.  She was engaging and really commanded the audience to get them ready. One by one, people got up on stage from the bar area and did their routines.  Some where hilarious and some were ok, but all were funny in one way or another.  What I love about this place is that no one judges you or the comics in any negative way.  They are very respectable and honest in their reactions and understand that each routine is very improv inspired so anything can happen.  Each comic is given their time to perform.  Since there's not many people inside you don't have to worry about heckling or people interrupting.  It's kind of like an exclusive private stand up session.  Many of the jokes were hilarious and I must warn you many are offensive as well.I can definitely see this place as a venue for aspiring comics looking to make their big break.  I even talked to a few of the comics after the stand up performances and all of them are nice and down to earth.  What is amazing is that they want to know your thoughts on the routines and what you liked and didn't like.  They are looking for constructive feedback so they can better strengthen their routines.  This is what makes this place awesome because it gets you thinking about comedy as an art form rather than a piece of entertainment.  You learn to appreciate it and interpret it much more adeptly.I highly recommend this place for people into small dive bars and comedy. Great local neighborhood spot. Ed and Rachel are always very welcoming to their regulars and new guests. Rachel makes an awesome spicy margarita. The space is tiny and cozy with a lot of character. It's a very homey meets divey atmosphere!Definitely swing by for the comedy at 8pm every night :) If you love dive bars and stand up comedy, this is the place to go. The bartender, Rachel, was super friendly and funny. I ordered whiskey sour, it was great. This is one of the best dive bars I have been to and highly recommend it to anyone. The stand up comedies were the best, I had one of the best nights of my life. You can sign up on the spot for doing so if you want to.The bar is very small so seating can be tight. It worked out for me because I made new friends.I will definitely go back in the future. Old Man Hustle is the epitome of a dive bar. It is very, very cozy (it can probably fit about 20 people max). Almost all of the people who were at the bar were middle-aged men, and it seemed like the kind of place where the people who go are regulars. There was one bartender working, and she was really nice, making an effort to remember my friend's and my name. The drinks were pretty solid, and maybe a little bit less expensive than typical New York prices. Overall, it's not really my scene, but I can definitely see the charm in Old Man Hustle! Old Man Hustle is one of my favorite places I've ever been.Only a few people can fit in here, so you can talk with everyone. Comedy was funny, drinks were cheap, people were nice.Go here. Discovered this place lingering aimlessly around the LES, with our group in dire need for a little refuge over the holiday weekendThis goes to show that there is indeed charm in the simple. Pretty much the tiny house equivalent to the New York bar scene. While lacking real estate, the bar and stage almost encompass a drunk man's feng shui, all without feeling claustrophobic.Good conversations (and their extensive cocktail offerings) make the space even roomier The name of this bar was too hard to resist. What a great hole in the wall in the East Village! It's really rare to find a $ bar in NYC, so we decided to come here to pregame one night. The drinks were all really cheap and the bar was cozy. It's capacity was probably 25 at most, but luckily the back booth was empty when we got there. I had a beer and a bud which consisted of a shot and a Red Stripe Beer. For only $9, this was a steal and quite tasty since the shot came with a shot of pineapple juice. Their drinks sounded great. They had a nice selection of craft cocktails for $10-$15 on the menu and a few craft beers and wines to choose from. The ambience of the bar was quite nice. It was dimly light and had a few chandeliers. In the back, there was a pretty sweet fuschia neon sign that read ""Old Man Hustle."" This would make for some pretty cool Instagram pics of ya ask me. It got extremely crowded as we were leaving, so make sure to come early. One of the best bars in new york! Great atmosphere and wonderful service! Sam and John have that running like clockwork! Thank you for my introduction to New York! Great place with the best bartender. Rachel remembered everyone's name and made us feel very at home. Great friendly place for drinks! This is a great place to have a drink and see comedy in the Lower East Side. The Comedy Shows are always free and the drinks are reasonably priced.Also the bar tenders give you a good solid pour. Especially Rachel. Perfect little spot for Friday Happy Hour after the first week of teaching. Specials did the trick and Rachel was really sweet. We'll be back! I seriously dig Old Man Hustle. I know people tend to get nostalgic about ""old"" New York; the places that comprised what we considered old NYC are certainly becoming more and more rare these days. That being said this city is always changing and adapting, and as long as that change is for the positive it's not necessarily a bad thing....but it does tend to make things more and more expensive, which can be (read: will be) a bummer for your wallet. OMH is a throwback for sure, but in a way that doesn't compromise quality for diveyness or confuse awesome service for bartender apathy (this disease is real; trust me I'm a scientist). In short, this place is not a dive bar, but should be the model every dive bar in the city is striving to achieve; cheap drinks in a relaxed atmosphere, where (if you're cool) the bartender will do a shot with you the first time you meet them. You would be forgiven for walking right past this place without even noticing it (I met some friends there last weekend and did just that...and I had been there before). The space is about as narrow as they come, and not overly advertised.  When you make your way inside, you'll notice that there is a tiny nook upfront that can hold a group of around four, a bar that takes up the majority of space that this place has to offer, and another small outpost in the back under the glowing ""Old Man Hustle"" neon sign. I really think it's a combo of that neon sign, and the fact that the bartender can make conversation with everyone in the place that gives OMH the retro feel I was talking about earlier. There is physically no way to be 2/3 people deep in this place, which forces conversation (and leads to those aforementioned shots with the bartender). The physical location of the bar also lends itself to ""throwback"" status, being buried deep in the LES off the east Broadway stop on the F; this neighborhood has looked the same for as long as I can remember. As for their drinks; nothing on Tap, but a solid selection of cocktails for around 11$, and a pretty decent bottle selection of beers. Where they shine is their happy hour. You can get a dollar off your beer, but will end up adding that dollar right back onto the price in the form of a shot (well of course, but the type of well is up to you). This can be dangerous. Like ""I don't remember anything after OMH shot-happy hour, dear god why did we do so many shots"", dangerous. If you find yourself deep on the lower east side looking for a chill place to have a beer or cocktail OMH should be high on your list.",https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Myp-QjbWQMEaJoSJoikjFA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/36Ei04tUAB0eUQhQfshBJg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/t1XS9DWjMMFWcQVcBpXEyg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tTK9_bqFKmmLrg9zSglQhQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qQbj_WNfy_fzYW-87mhnDQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tghXJViu7NvCCbyHVln5Lg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oGRq7uikEq3xvsWFdhcOSQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/785eDXnbKZHP9OuVMoshOQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fdcVWRn4ACWkz3TWWMIN3A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VQeUcmX3dysdiYzAkhIT8A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jZmo7ALjBR13SF91hlkvEA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yK6kOgMP4zTHB_kqxYqJmg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Hi4XtdCYOonet8b84x665w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6bgGoa0mbxHu7Jdk6etx5A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HCXh8tQ2Sl87OaiOh809yA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/P8J-Raf_jlPJn4_QvkTT7A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/r_wbDIdDVJUnFDz_Sam5ag/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Eq-4ZzzHKjScmo2FxCJA5Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/eECxeAdIQoGVFjfuTn8pRQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/90ZO8QbgtFWAwgQzhczvtQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/y_M68XI4xVxVQ54TwKIVPg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EgGHvNfEBSRPW8-dtG0-HQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VtUioVX17e5T5YpaI8DLiQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1IufVR60qUnTCM20mEc53A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/aT4wCiM5IGBlUeclqENaPg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/w4seF7g45d215n-wlPBLAw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/r-_i7stop5nD7x-gzZu9tA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dzbJNG5ZOehLJw4a4R8zng/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2dd5mNVR4RZiWptaYnV5Fw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WXHDrvnHKIvGSeO_bAg1dw/258s.jpg
https://www.yelp.com//biz/optimum-gourmet-deli-new-york,optimum-gourmet-deli-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Delis,NA,NA,"Best deli in NYC by far, the coffee is always very fresh even at 3am and the food never disappoints. I come here every day and will continue to come back because the food choice is endless and cooked to your liking by BooBoo on the grill. I come here for bagels and sandwiches once in a while.  I went yesterday to order a sandwich and picked up a loaf of Pepperidge Farm white bread.  Checked the package and expiration date.  If you're familiar with their packaging, you know they have a heat sealed wrapper inside and a bag outside. This morning I opened it up to make toast and find the inside wrapper shredded open, a big hole that went through a few slices and rodent droppings!  I immediately tossed it because I was grossed out.  What I don't understand is how is the outter  wrapper still in perfect condition? As good as it gets when it comes to a LES bodega. Muhammed and his staff are extremely friendly and are always in the mood to strike conversation with all their patrons. Their sandwiches are on point. Keep up the good work, boys! Was starving and this deli was PACKED and it was 3:00am. Got me the Pho #2 it was definitely spicy and delicious. Great deliAlso Seth Rogan approves of this deli. Love this place!  Great food at reasonable prices, plus a super friendly staff - all of which can be tough to find in this neighborhood.  Very solid breakfast sandwich.  Highly recommended. I really enjoyed my chicken, cheese and avocado wrap.  It was around $7 and filled me up.  However,  they did put it in silver foil.  This is fine anywhere else in NYC,  but this is China Town and my wrap was mistaken for a sword.  Within just 2 bites, I was challenged to a duel by a Ninja and his Samurai sword outside the Hong Kong Supermarket.  A challenge I gladly accepted. I ducked his first swipe before rising to chop his head off with my chicken and avocado wrap.  Testimony to the quality of both the wrap and it's contents - his head came clean off and rolled down Prince Street. As for the deli?  Good people.  Well priced.  My favourite  deli in the area.  I'll go back for further lunches,  dinners and duels.  Highly  recommended. Life changing egg, sausage and cheese on a toasted bagel. Perfect ratios of bagel, cheese, sausage and egg. Wow!! My shop orders from them all the time. Mohammed is a very friendly and amazing guy. Food always comes quick and hot. Have yet to be disappointed by my orders. Breakfast sandwiches, burgers...It's all good. Delicious AF. Our entire office eats there 3x a day. The omelets are fluffy and magical. The iced coffee is superior to all others in the neighborhood (sorry Irving Farm) and it's $2.50. Every neighborhood needs their go-to deli for a big sandwich at an affordable price and Optimum is just that. Clean store, friendly staff, and fresh/tasty offerings. They have an extensive menu of hot and cold 'wiches, wraps, and paninis and are accommodating and fast. Recommended for an easy lunch on Ludlow St. I love this deli. The prices are reasonable, the guys behind the counter are always extremely friendly. They've got cheap milk and I can always trust they'll have my favorite flavor chip and gatorade for the weekend hangover. I can get a plain bagel toasted with butter and somehow it tastes delightful. I love living on this block with the deli right here and I'll be sad to move. The food is great and the price is inexpensive. But more importantly, the people that works here are awesome! They're super nice :) I usually get a salad w smoked salmon. I always see them prep the vegetables which is a great thing bc that means the veggies are fresh never stale or leftovers from previous days. Best deli in LES. The chicken cutlet is so crispy and the cheddar cheese is so gooey. Hot chocolate is bomb. The prices so low. I want to date optimum deli. I've been going to this deli for awhile now, the breakfast sandwiches and the Broome Deli Special are both great. Last night, on a whim, I tried the waffle fries. My god, these guys deserve a Michelin Star for those things. They are perfect. Optimum Deli comes to the LES from the same team that brought the neighborhood the vaunted and beloved Happiness Deli, which was formerly located on Delancy, just up the block from this brand new spot.The ownership structure is apparently quite similar to that of the now shuttered Happiness Deli.  According to the guys who work at Optimum (who I recognize from Happiness), it's the brother of the owner of Happiness that owns the new joint.  Basically, it's just Happiness Deli a block further south in new--and much nicer and cleaner--digs.  The (awesome) menu is pretty much the same, as is the selection of non-deli goods.  Right now they're not selling beer or wine, but, according to the people working there, they will be soon; the application for a license has just been submitted, and since the ownership structure has (barely) changed, as has the name, they have to get a new license.The food is everything that people in the neighborhood know and love.  Happiness was long regarded as one of the (if not THE) best deli in the neighborhood, and since I moved down here, it has been a favorite of mine.  They have a great selection of cooked-to-order sandwiches, including (and this rocks my world) breakfast sandwiches cooked 24-7, 365!  And, the sandwiches are GREAT.  The ingredients are fresh, the combinations work very well, and it's relatively cheap.  $7 will get you an amazing sandwich on a hero, and it will fill you up!  Many of their sandwiches, especially breakfast sandwiches, are only like $3.  And, once they get the beer going again, their beer prices are great.  I'm a big fan of the #7 sandwich, the name of which I can't remember off the top of my head, but it is a chicken, jalapeo, and pepper jack combo.  The other night I went and they were out of something they needed for it (I think jalapeo), and the guy offered to whip me up something similar, and he came to me with a chicken and spicy peppers sandwich that was nothing short of spectacular.  I was so pleased (and admittedly a bit . . . uh . . . tipsy) that I called them and told them it rocked and that it should be a staple on the menu, since it was off-menu!The people that work here are awesome, too.  They're friendly, funny, and totally willing to make jokes with you.Also, they take credit, and a $5 minimum.  Not a fan of CC minimums, but hell, at least it's not something ridiculous.If I could change anything, I'd have them stock a few more groceries.  Like bread.  But then again, it's a deli that stocks some groceries, not a grocery store that has a deli counter.I am SO, SO happy that Happiness hasn't left the LES.  Yeah, it's got a different name, but it's the same animal.  If you live here and need a great and filling sandwich, this should be one of your first stops.  It's easily my favorite deli in the neighborhood, and maybe in Manhattan.  It's better than the several delis around my old place in the Village . . . Optimum deli has a  very convenient location  l. I get breakfast there sometimes . The bagels are good but not amazing . They toast them well and put a good amount of cream cheese. I once or twice got fries from there and they were yummy . They have a good selection of candies and they have s'mores poptarts until recently when they disappeared. I will go back many times . 5 stars but the missing poptarts take away one . When they get them back I will update this review . I am indeed obsessed with these poptarts . Thank you for your time . best deli hands down in the LES.love all the sandwiches...they're amazing. including the breakfast sandwiches. also, the people who work there are great.

https://www.yelp.com//biz/orchard-grocer-new-york,orchard-grocer-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Delis,Vegan,Sandwiches,"Nice people, great products, and though it seems like it could be overpriced, the prices seem to be totally fair!Great sandwiches. Nice setup.I'm not vegan, but this place makes me eat more like one.A nice addition to the neighborhood. 3 words: vegan. sandwich. heaven.Dropped by here twice in one weekend because I was hooked. The Rocko and The Monty are both excellent, and their chickpea tuna salad is tasty too. Satisfying both flavor and texture for tofu sandwiches is no easy feat, but orchard grocer has mastered it.   You won't find bland or slimy tofu here, their food is filling and packs a flavorful punch that fuels you up for wherever you're headed.I'll definitely be back. Fabulous! .. and the staff is the best! They love what they do, and they love talking to and helping customers.   I would hire anyone of them tomorrow if I owned a food store. This is a New York treat, and a throwback to a time when NYC had quality products and quality employees.  I phoned to make certain they had Cavi-Art plant based caviar before I ventured over. The clerk on the phone was so nice, and when I casually asked her a question - she didn't just say ""I'm very busy"" (this was Christmas Eve for many last minute shoppers), instead, she had me hold for a nano-second and as I was about to say ""not to worry, I check when I get there"" she already had an answer for me.  That started my positive presentation of the place.Don't let the small size influence your decision to go inside and shop, order and take home some fabulous vegan products.   good things come in small packages - and this store is one of them!I would suggest Orchard Grocer to anyone, and you never know who you will run into while there.  I will also be back to shop for other items when I have more time to enjoy checking out their entire product lines. What a time to be alive. NYC now has a 100% vegan and palm oil free deli! Conveniently located in a busy shopping area of the LES, this modern bodega offers much more than just fantastic sandwiches. I was amazed by the selection of cheeses, dry foods, and specialty brands occupying the shelves. The assortment and merchandising products is reminiscent of a Dean &amp; Deluca, but all vegan. They also have a selection of pastries from local companies, as well as soft serve ice cream. My favorite of the sandwiches that I tried was The Edith ($8)-a fresh NY bagel topped with a generous spread of cashew cream cheese, and carrot lox. I have never had real lox, but these tangy carrots are delicious, especially with the contrasting rich, creamy cashew cheese. The bagel sandwich was so huge that I had to save half for the next day. I was almost equally impressed by their Reuben (The Marlowe, $12) which was among the best vegan versions of the sandwich I have ever eaten. Piled high with tender, richly spiced roast seitan 'beef' and vegan cheese, which melts into the fresh sauerkraut for one seriously hearty sandwich. You will feel like a vegan Guy Fieri eating this one. My least favorite was The Monty ($12), which is their rendition of a classic deli sandwich-cold cuts, cheese, olives, and roasted peppers, on a hero roll. The bread to filling ratio was way off, with less than a tablespoon of veganaise, and only a couple slices of meat and cheese. Maybe it was an off day, but this sammy really needed more fillings. I highly recommend Orchard Grocer to any lovers of fine food, regardless of your dietary preferences. I look forward to returning the next time I am in NYC. I have read about Orchard Grocer all over Thrillist and Facebook and had it on my list of ""must tries"" for a long time. I happened to be on the LES for the Pickle Festival and found myself across the street. I finally went in and checked it out. Orchard Grocer is a clean grocery with all Vegan products. Super convenient.I ordered the Marlowe: Reuben with beet brined Blackbird seitan, local sauerkraut, house made thousand island, Violife provolone slice, on marble rye. $12.The sandwich was freshly prepared while I waited. crispy on the outside from the sandwich press and evenly heated throughout. All the ingredients were tasty. I wasn't expecting such a ""briny"" flavor but the textures were great. The prices are reasonable especially for vegan food.I'd come back to try more items on the menu. Can't get enough of this place. Wish they had a tiny bit more seating beyond the 3 window stools. Every sandwich is better than the next and their specials are really fun and creative (umm vegan shrimp po boys yes plz). Their soft serve never disappoints and worth the trip in 37 degree weather. Very good spot if you are on a vegan diet! Their sandwiches are carefully executed and you can see they really put attention to each ingredient in the sandwich. I had a Reuben (Marlowe as hey call it) and I have to say it was really good. Perhaps the only thing I would change would be seitan since in my opinion it was too thick. My girlfriend had a special they offered with an ""omelette"". I have to say it was excellent. You would never tell that was not a ""real"" omelette.While we were waiting for our sandwiches we ordered a soft serve ice cream. Wow...! I would say it was even better than the regular soft serve...!! Apart from sandwiches and soft serve :) they also offer a large selection of vegan products. Certainly a spot you should have on your list in you're in the area...! What could be better than an amazing vegan bodega? An amazing vegan bodega with a deli counter and local fresh baked goods! Fantastic array of vegan goods to be found here, including deli ""meats"", prepared meals, cheeses from all over (including the illusive Violife, which I have only found in Europe!) and omg try the ""tub"" of spreadable vegan cheese it is EXACTLY like mac n' cheese, but better! And cruelty free :)My favorite sandwich here is hands down the Bowery, which is a breakfast sandwich of vegan egg, bacon and cheese and is to die for. Get two, you're gonna want another one because you wont believe how good the first one was. This cute and tidy shot gun mvegan spot has counter sandwiches and a small specialty selection of vegan and vegetarian grocery items like vegan cheeses and ""meats"".  They even had vegan yogurt.  In the dry goods section - vegetarian brown gravy packets and tapenades and sauces.Although the grocery items are expensive, the sandwiches and salads at the counter are a rational $10-$12.  My friend got a cubano sandwich.  I got a pbj bar cause I wasn't hungry.   The bar was decent tasting if kinda chalky the way you expect, $4.  I've learned to love that chalkiness. The BBQ jackfruit sandwich looked good.The staff was nice and we scored some gluten free pumpkin donuts on the house because they said they were going to throw them away. My friends sandwich was enormous, definitely two servings.  My complaint was that the bread was too big.   The menu of salads and sandwiches looks good though and for vegan specialty items they are affordable.   Get it to go unless your lucky to score one of the three bar stools. New York is famous for it's sandwiches and now I know why! Try The Bowery for a vegan spin on the bacon and egg roll and be sure to check out their Instagram for daily special sandwich. The perfect hang over cure. This place is PHENOMENAL. One of the best sandwiches I've had period, vegan or not vegan. It really surprised me.I tried the omelette special on GF bread....outstanding. The tofu was seasoned perfectly and bursting with flavor, as well as the sauted peppers, mushrooms and shallots. The cheese was so tasty, and the contrast of the soft tofu with the crispy bun was so satisfying. Add the ketchup/mayo and arugula and you got yourself a perfect sandwich. My boyfriend had the Reuben, it was also equally as amazing and bursting with flavor. They clearly put care and attention towards each and every ingredient featured in their sandwiches.The soft serve ice cream, omg. Vegan soft serve can actually taste better than dairy soft serve!!! I was blown away.They also carry exquisite vegan macaroons. Try the rose flavor and you'll be transported to heaven.I already can't wait to come back during my next visit to NYC. A 100% vegan grocery store in Manhattan! Finally! And it's super cute and reasonably priced! I'm very excited about this place and you should be too. :) :)***LOCATION &amp; INTERIOR***Orchard Grocer is located on Orchard St (self-explanatory), a.k.a. that small, weirdly ~trendy~ strip that runs through Chinatown. It's right next door to Moo Shoes, a vegan shoe store. PSA: Moo Shoes now carries the vegan Birkenstocks in black and brown!When I first visited Orchard, I was surprised by how tiny it was. It's more of a bodega/deli than an actual grocery store, so don't expect to find produce or anything like that. One wall is lined with shelves of specialty vegan items, like sauces, chocolate, and snacks, while the other wall is taken up by a refrigerated shelf stocked with a large array of vegan cheeses and some vegan proteins. The prices are pretty fair, especially considering that there are items you can't find at your neighborhood Whole Foods or natural market.Along the back wall is the deli/counter, where you can order their amazing sandwiches or pick up some fresh baked goods and soft serve. They often collab with vegan bakers (usually from Brooklyn) to feature a few of their items each week, so the offerings are constantly changing. You can even eat your food in the little store, at the bar along the front window.Oh, and the interior is very neat and clean, and the staff is super, super sweet. I'm obsessed.***FOOD***I ordered the much raved about Marlowe, the vegan reuban sandwich. Even though I asked for no dressing, it was still SO GOOD. It's made to order so I received it hot and toasted. The bread was thin and crispy just how I like, the cheese they used was wonderfully melty without a strong taste, and the vegan meat (seitan maybe?) was a great texture with a perfectly smokey flavor. It was the size of a normal homemade sandwich, but filling enough. My only complaint is that it's quite pricey at $12 for a relatively simple take-out sandwich, but on the other hand I've had much worse meals for $12 in the city.I also had a blondie from Gone Pie, the vegan bakers that frequent the vegan pop up shops. I wasn't really fan of it to be honest, but I'm still excited that Orchard carries local vegan brands and will definitely try their other Gone Pie/local desserts the next time I go.***NOTES/RECOMMENDATION***New York is the capital of delis and also one of the most vegan friendly cities in the world, and Orchard Grocer does a great job of bringing together these two things. I'll be back to try their other sandwiches (vegan bagel and lox!!!), soft serve (which I've heard is delicious), and baked goods, as well as to pick up some vegan pantry essentials. The bagel with smoked carrot and cashew cream cheese is amazing. Huge sandwiches. Amazing staff. Stocked with great products! Absolutely amazing even for nonvegans. Best lox I have ever had including real lox!!! Orchard street is one of my favorite streets on the LES. Where you can experience old New York with a little bit of a face lift. This grocer exemplifies the spirit of the neighborhood. It may seem like a typical deli/butcher store, but it is nothing but. This little galley is stacked from floor to ceiling with vegan specialty foods and has a great selection of meat-free meats. They have yummy healthy sandwiches and soups to go. If this is your thing it's definitely worth a visit. This place is lit! Finally came here yesterday after dreaming about these sandwiches. When I walked in, they were playing Alice Coltrane, so kudos to the  musical ambiance.I ordered the Edith and Pumpkin-Vanilla Swirl soft serve with naked sprinkles. I had the ice cream first, and it was delicious! I think the Pumpkin was prominent in flavor than the Vanilla, but lovely nonetheless. They should get cones (and gluten-free ones too).I ate the sandwich a little later. Wow, what a culinary masterpiece. The carrot lox had a nice smoky, slightly briney taste. Cashew cream cheese and the actual bagel (had it on an Everything) were a knockout! I passed out, woke up and ate various bites of it as the night progressed; amazed at every bite. I will definitely be returning. Can't wait to try their other sandwiches with gluten-free bread soon! A small cute vegan grocery store. I love how they stock a variety of chocolates and vegan food. I ordered gluten-free sandwiches a while back, but the breads were really dry and hard. I wouldn't recommend getting the gluten-free bread options for the deli sandwiches. The best sandwiches! We had to return here to taste more. The Bowery is simple but amazingly good, all the others were also great with special and rich flavours. Vegan food at its best This little grocery/sandwich shop is a trip to the past and the future. It has the classic feel of a vintage grocery store, with the best vegan snacks, ingredients, drinks, and so on. Their sandwiches and service are both terrific. The only downside is that there are no bathrooms for customers (I ate at the counter) and there are only 3 seats. Orchard grocer is an incredible addition the LES. Their deli is the bomb. I've tried two of their buffalo tofu sandwiches that have been on special, and both were amazing. Each was $10 (without tax) and a large portion size. If you go with a friend, I'd recommend splitting two sandwiches; both times that I've ordered my sandwiches, they had been cut in half, making them easy to share. The people working here are SO wonderful and genuinely kind. My two suggestions are 1) to have sample salads in the cooler to showcase those options as they all sound delicious! And 2) I would love for them to have a sandwich loyalty punch card, e.g. buy 10, get the 11th free. Nevertheless, I will keep coming back! Next on the list to try is the tiramisu they have from Rawsome Treats.",https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6KbQCMYr4boRkveFSqAE4Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6PHLAQveaO6ba129WG4ufg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1RVF5pvho2inOi_52So6vQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wYLYoLUPPB3EuAYSba2n0w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/80V67xqC9kjkPX-4PvDduQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/00pDO6WefDvlcadQRCavxg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SmD8YswJSy7l_ZAiy0yOAw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vYp8l_asXhtO6yCUOUIMvA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/e_hWsbmGuupj-JglCG7M2g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BbnPPxiatQydl09k8RndrA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XdJZRDw4oekoJrd2rYzT0A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wuSxkP4O57bxz6_1aI2FTg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/n4KQAouAldF7VtosV0XgcA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/a8Sa6ZYhOsWsYSXw7eF48g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/O6GKrHWhRcBYBNQrWEPmAQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Ct6LPU1gz75oesNnzbu3Vw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NCr9-bEqpsTXFG0UZ9m_OQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Fr4qMIC67saTHEN_ZmWm0w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MrIlrhDp5jSfClmH12hSKA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1p5eIdkipnRo24y4jBLkRA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/p6Udq0UCzMJ-LPDwylVhIg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kK3Wf0Rk2qGbi1R1ON-kvQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qWuFLYY3KLGC6zh7r5Aw2w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dfttBTsqTBWLl24ZuRyBJQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QI4m4wKt78-SGH3ora3IJQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YI1_kMCXuwR5OkDDYpqr8w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RlWgOUc6BgvNVwVhZu4YXw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kM1eT5fy0X3T856Cm8WQbw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MU16roFrrQ-yndq1djKecA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GLhntdeAiCGlhiG2KUQqVA/258s.jpg
https://www.yelp.com//biz/osteria-morini-new-york,osteria-morini-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Italian,Bars,NA,"Remarkable, homemade pasta.  Attentive service.  Fairly easy-to-find location.  Comprehensive array of Italian options on menu.  Servers who actually spoke Italian and weren't Real Housewives from Bergen County or wherever who called themselves ""Italian."" Seating and navigating the space were rather cumbersome, though--because there's so little space.  The restaurant is tiny.I'd come back when in NYC. Hm. I came here for their Monday late night special ($12 pastas after 9pm/also available on Sunday). It's a pretty good deal then, but I still don't know how I feel. We tried the Cappelletti, Garganelli and Fusili. The cappelletti started off being my favorite, but the truffle butter just gets too rich once you're a few bites in. The garganelli had no flavor whatsoever for me. The fusili was sadly the most edible for me, but tasted just a bit better than boxed pasta with canned tomato sauce. Our server was really awkward and kept trying to clear our plates when we weren't even halfway done. Definitely don't come here if you're going to pay full price. Asians were forced to sit in the back of the restaurant by active kitchen doors when the place was still mostly empty.  My table and a neighboring party were the only Asians in the restaurant.  The segregation was clear. But I'll draw no conclusions.  I'm only stating the facts based on my experience. I shouldn't have to defend myself but there was nothing exceptional on my end that called for such treatment.  I arrived early, straight from work dressed in business casual. I'm an experienced New York diner, having lived here for over 3 decades and have frequented many fine dining establishments, including other Altamarea restaurants. The food is fine.  It might even be great.  Draw your own conclusions Nice spot, decent lunch. Good location &amp; ambiance - it feels like a cozy lodge inside. However, the starters weren't great, and the sandwich our server recommended was a let down. RESERVATIONS: Made online about a week in advance. It was probably unnecessary; at 12pm we were one of two tables in the restaurant. By the time we left around 1:30pm, it was much busier, but there were still several empty tables.THE COST: $37.57 total per person (including tax/tip) for 3 starters &amp; 3 entrees, shared between 3 people.MUST-HAVES: Cappelletti w/ truffle butter.STARTERS:* Burrata - 3 starsNot as soft as other burrata's I've had; overall a lackluster dish. * Roasted quail with fig - 3.5 starsPretty good sharp flavor. The meat was a bit tough, but paired well with the fig. * Polpetini - 3 starsNot too memorable or impressive. A bit dry.ENTREES: * Cappelletti w/ truffle butter - 4 starsUnexpectedly my favorite! The truffle butter was perfect, the pasta just right.* Fusilli - 3.5 starsNot really a standout dish; the sauce was plain &amp; standard, lacking texture, and tasting almost like a canned pasta sauce. I'd expect this quality of sauce from a cafeteria but not from an Italian restaurant in NYC!* Egg and ham sandwich - 3.5 starsDisappointing (this was rec from our server); bun was dry, meats indistinguishable. My friends noticed one of the pancettas that had a bit of crunch, but I didn't notice it. One slight redeeming factor was the runny egg yolk. I came here on a Saturday night for a yummy anniversary dinner and this place sure satisfied my pasta needs. Being under the same umbrella as Marea, I was hoping for fresh made pasta and I got it. The service was wonderful and a good amount of tables in the back. Eating at the bar also looked enjoyable.We first got some fresh bread. Then we ordered the Fegatini which was duck liver mousse on thick airy bread. I loved it! It was super tasty, wonderful flavor of the duck mousse. The onion agrodoice wasn't overwhelming. Right amount of sweet to the mousse.Then we shared the capetelli which was delicious ravioli with truffle and prosciutto. It was large in portion and so delicious. The pasta was al dente. Plenty of ricotta with a delicious hit of truffle. Sauce was light and creamy. So GOOOD! The squid ink pasta was also made perfectly al dente. Ragu was nicely balanced, light and had great flavor from the shrimp. Overall, a great place for some fresh pasta. Came here for a late lunch. The food is inoffensive but not memorable. $22 for lunch pasta is fine. I got the pasta with truffle butter, cream, radicchio and prosciutto. The radicchio was a bit of an odd addition, and there was barely a hint of truffles. The pasta itself was cooked well and had a good. Overall, not a bad choice but not entirely worth repeating. The very first thing I noticed when I walked in here is that the tables are oddly placed in a diagonal manner. For those of you who like clean straight lines, this is going to drive you crazy. The food was really good though that I have to give it five stars. Wow, meatballs. I'm usually not a fan of meatballs, but when my friend ordered them, I was so glad because they were amazing!!! Flavorful right down to the core.My tagliatelle was meaty and delicious - they do not skimp on the meat and I loved that. Dessert was amazing. Wine was good. Service decent. Of all the Italian places in NYC, Osteria Morini is definitely in my top 5. Not sure why it's taken me so long to review this place. Actually the first time we visited had to have been 10+ years ago. I think, like most New Yorkers when it comes to really good Italian food, I sorta took it for granted that I had already reviewed Osteria Morini!I love a nice old-school (but still modern enough) Manhattan Italian restaurant. This place gets it right, from the expert waitstaff to the expertly crafted food. For the most part, you're probably coming here for the pasta (and you probably can't go wrong in that department). But for me, it's the porchetta. This is one of the few places that offers this dish all the time and they get it right basically all the time.So, yeah, I kinda like this place a lot. Not that cheap, but quality rarely is... Osteria Moroni was one of my favorite restaurants when I first dined here that when I saw a Gilt City coupon for a 3 course lunch, I immediately bought it. I kind of wish I didn't as the experience the second time was nothing like the first. We came this past Labor Day, the restaurant was pretty much empty, which wasn't surprising as everyone likes to take a longer holiday weekend. To start, ordered the meatballs and fried calamari / vegetables. The fried platter should have been called a fried vegetable plate as they was only like 3 half pieces of calamari. The fried cauliflower was good and my favorite. The meatballs were okay - nothing memorable. After receiving our appetizers, it took forever to receive our pasta entrees. I didn't know it took that long to cook pasta - we waited around 40 minutes to get our pastas after we had finished eating our appetizers. Service was close to none as no one came to acknowledge the long wait / explain why our entrees were taking so long. The tables that came after us even got their appetizers and pastas before us...didn't make any sense. When the tagliatelle and garganelli finally arrived, we were starving and dived in. The tagliatelle was delicious - we both loved the ragu. Our clear favorite as the garganelli (peas, prosciutto, and truffle oil) was too creamy that it completely overpowered anything else. There was a serious lack of prosciutto too. For dessert, we got the tiramisu and the chocolate pudding. I made a note that it was a special occasion, so it was nice that they bought out a complementary scoop of pistachio gelato. All the desserts were really good. I didn't have a definite favorite as each stood out in their own way. The chocolate pudding was really chocolatey and super sweet - if you love super sweet milk chocolate, this dessert is for you. The pistachio gelato was light and refreshing. It balanced out the other desserts. After this experience, sadly, I don't think I'll be back. I had dinner here last night with my coworkers and man, though I doubted the high-end esque Italian restaurants, I was wrong. I do want to note that expensive Italian restaurants are usually underwhelming, since the ingredients are generally cheap, you expect the meal to follow suit. The ambiance: dim lighting, and the restaurant is fairly large, so a lot of seating. Our reservation was for 8pm on a Tuesday night, and it was only about a third full. I'm sure that on weekends, it gets packed.Let's talk about the food at Osteria Morini. First thing to note, great bread to start. They provide ciabatta that has a hint of herbal flavors along with olive oil. We couldn't stop asking for more.We started off with crudo di agnello (lamb tartare), burrata, and polpettine (prosciutto and mortadella meatballs). The burrata was paired with a beautiful strawberries and balsamic; it was incredibly fresh. You can't go wrong with burrata. The meatballs were my favorite appetizer. It was perfectly cooked and topped off with a great marinara sauce. The crispy bread was well paired with the meatballs. My least favorite appetizer was the lamb tartare - it was a little too gamey.For the entrees, we ordered a tagliatelle, torcia (squid ink), and the garganelli (pasta quills with truffle butter). Of these, the pastas to note were the torcia and the tagliatelle. The tagliatelle is a basic and common pasta. Osteria Morini just made it exceptionally. The torcia, get it!!! It's a little sweet, perfectly cooked, and the flavors burst. Ok last... the veal with truffle cream. What a wonderful way to end a meal. It's heavy, but it's worth it. The cream sauce is heaven.I'll definitely be back to try more of Michael White's dishes. 2 things: Treated like a queen and ate like a queen.I had dinner here last night with my boyfriend to celebrate our anniversary. Our table was ready even though we arrived 20-30 mins earlier than our reservation. The hostesses were super friendly and even offered to store my bouquet in the fridge. Upon being seated, our waitress (I think her name was Lily) brought us a two glasses of complimentary wine for our special occasion. Seriously felt so special in the moment and it was such a treat!For apps, we started with some meat and cheese, we had the Prosciutto and ""King of Salami"" along with the soft cheese + Lamb Tartare. This was all prepared by the bar in the front of the restaurant and you can see them slice the meat! Not sure how we finished it ALL, but we did. IT was a lot of meat and the prosciutto was unbelievably delicious! Don't get me started with the lamb tartare... I couldn't stop eating it! We didn't order our mains till we finished our apps and it took us a while to finish it. An hour later, we killed it! By now, we were pretty full of meat and cheese... For mains, we shared the special duck breast with candied walnuts and also ordered the squid ink pasta. Not sure which one we were more excited about! Not going to lie, but all their pastas sounded so good and we were struggling to choose! The pasta was perfectly cooked, super al dente and had balanced flavor (perhaps could spice it up??) The duck breast was seared beautifully (medium rare) but I personally like it more on the medium side. Nonetheless, everything was delicious!Okay and now the most important part of the meal, DESSERT. Once again we were struggling to decide on a dessert. We were torn between the frozen peach custard and the panna cotta. On our first date, I had panna cotta, so a part of us wanted to have that again... But then there was the peach custard too... The waitress helped us decide on the panna cotta. Let me tell you... their panna cotta is dangerous! I could easily order 5 and have that instead of dinner... IT WAS PHENOMENAL. Texture was sooooo buttery smooth, with hints of citrus from the candied lemon and crunchy granola. What sealed the meal was that our waitress even surprised us with a complimentary dessert after we finished the panna cotta! She brought us the peach custard... We were so overwhelmed by the superb service, we were in a daze.Overall, our dinner was so special, all thanks to the team at Osteria Morini. The ambience was exactly what we were looking for, nothing too fancy that i'd need to dress up for but at the same time wanted fancy food. Can't wait to be back for the octopus and gnocchi!!Special thanks to our waitress, Lily!! My go-to for fulfilling my pasta cravings. I came here Monday night around 9:45pm, when the pastas are $12 (after 9pm on Monday's and I believe Sunday's as well). The two of us ordered 6 pasta dishes - we wanted to try them all but figured that might be overkill. My two favorites were the raviolis with truffle butter and the one with lamb. I'll definitely be back to take advantage of this amazing deal. Great Italian food! Came in on a Monday afternoon and it was virtually empty except for two tables. The host was nice and said if it got cold he could turn the heat up. The waitress was extremely sweet and prompt as well. I didn't get her name but she has lightish brown hair in a ponytail with a soft voice. The ambiance and decor of the restaurant was nice as well, modern and welcoming without trying too hard. For main dish I ordered the cappelletti and my friend ordered the fusilli. From pictures it seemed as if the cappelletti portion size was too small, but it's just enough! It's extremely filling and satisfying, however it's a 4/5 maybe 3.5/5 dish because the butter progressively became overwhelming with each bite. However, it's still a delicious dish and should be tried at least once. My friend enjoyed the fusilli and was pleasantly surprised, they also ordered two different kinds of beer and enjoyed both! They also asked if we wanted bread, but next time I'll skip out on it. It was dry and had a strong cardamom taste. For dessert, I ordered the torta di olio. It was my first time having olive oil cake and it was a great experience! The cake itself was dense and sweet, and the lemon buttercream on top tasted faintly of lemon and cream- very simple but I didn't like it as it was too thick. It also came with grapefruit sorbet on the side which was tart and delightful. Grapefruit is the worst tasting fruit but they managed to make it taste good! It also had granola which should be substituted for something else or opted out since it was really hard to chew and it didn't pair well with the cake or sorbet. Overall it was a really good experience and I'll be back! Found this place on Yelp and it was Ahh-mazing. I would highly suggest to any and all people. I came here on a date night so there was just two of us.For apps, we got a meat and cheese platter as well as a salad, both were amazing.For dinner we decided to share one pasta dish and one entree. We got a pork entree that was so good. Both were amazing.Overall, it is romantic and trendy. The wine and food were not only great, but affordable. Part of the Michael White empire this is their more casual walk in sit down restaurant. It's a nice space and great for groups or for a meal. Service was great with specials and dishes explained thoroughly, though they gave us the wrong salad they were quick to replace and give is the correct one after. The front area has a bar and the charcuterie cheese preparation area. Its a great spot to sit down for a quick meal or to have charcuterie. The back area is the sit down tables area and you get a nice view of the kitchen and the wood fired oven cooking up at this time tomahawk ribeye steaks. Stand outs of the night were the truffle ravioli. The taste of truffle really comes through. The pork ragu taglatelle which had a nice meat sauce that clung to the pasta. All the pasta was made fresh and the chewiness happens on each bite. I particularly liked my ribeye which was cooked perfectly in the wood fired oven and had a nice char. The porchetta was also nice with a nice crispy skin and tender pork. Our charcuterie board had a nice mix and match of items suggested by our server. The mortadella, olives, and sharp cheddar cheese made a great appetizer. It's a nice spot but at times consistency can be hit or miss. I've heard the hype about this place. Finally got to try it. I could have had really high expectations but it was not that impressive for me. I started with a charcuterie plate with smoked prosciutto, salami, duck liver, soft cow cheese and hard goat cheese. I'm usually very excited for liver when I see it on the menu but this duck liver did not deliver for me. I can't put a word on it but I just felt like something was just missing. I had two bites and I felt like it was a waste not finishing it. However, the prosciutto was one of the best I ever had. The Cappelletti pasta was a little disappointing. I love truffle, cheese, prosciutto and butter but this dish was just not cutting it. The flavor was just alright, pasta was overcooked and the sauce was very mild. I expected aromatic, creamy, rich , hearty bites but it was just light and plain. They do have a late night pasta special you could be interested in, $12 pasta after 9pm on Sunday's and Monday's. Food: 4.5Service: 4Ambience: 4Walked in a Friday around 7pm and managed to snag a table in the front - success! I'm usually all for making a reservation, but it's nice to know I can keep this place in my back pocket when I'm going for a spontaneous casual-but-cute date night. Loved pretty much everything! Starting with the wine list - they do flights which is pretty awesome when you just want a taste. I got the lambrusci flight, which is a slightly bubbly red wine. Onto the food:Rucola salad: kinda basic but done really well with slightly more special ingredients - the crispy speck is more interesting than bacon, and ricotta salata adds a little more funk than mozzarella or parmesan would. Tagliatelle: a classic that can't be done better, slightly thinner and thicker noodles than spaghetti that really laps up the bolognese sauce. Cappelletti: our server's favorite pasta, and it was delicious! Little packages that look like wontons filled with truffle ricotta (you can actually see black truffle specks inside and it's not overly flavorful) in a butter sauce that manages to NOT be heavy - how they accomplished this idk, but it was absolutely perfect. Bistecca: a perfect steak for sharing with a good crust on the exterior and a refreshing bunch of watercress. Budino: somehow I always end up ordering this as dessert, I just can't get over chocolate and hazelnut! It's a little small (for my huge sweet tooth) so you might have to fight for the last smooth delicious bite.Osteria Morini excels at being the neighborhood Italian restaurant that is refreshingly authentic (there are so many trendy places now), not complicated, making really good food. With Michael White, pasta genius, you're in good hands. Even though I've been to Marea, Alto, Vaucluse, Convivio and Ai Fiori, Morini is my absolute favorite Michael White endeavor (though I have enjoyed all of them with the exception of the long-shuttered Alto). My wife and I almost always go for lunch because there's an insanely good pre fixe lunch deal with an app and a pasta for around 30 dollars. Considering the quality of ingredients and the skilled preparation, it's an absolute bargain. All of the pastas are top notch (it's Michael White so that's a given anyways), but the salads and small entrees are great as well. I particularly love the seafood salad and the hangar steak. Service is as great as every one of White's restaurants and they make great homemade sodas as well. An absolutely gem of a place. Osteria Morini is one of my favorite restaurants, hands down. They have homemade pasta, which melts in your mouth. I come here all the time when I'm in the city, my family loves this restaurant. I recommend getting the tortellini in brodo, meat and cheese board, (the parmigiano gelato spread is TO DIE FOR), the gramigna is one of their signature dishes, the cappelletti is what i photographed and that was amazing, and you should try the garganelli. They also have amazing meats and cheeses, as well as great wine.If you want a great homemade italian cuisine, this is the place for you. Friendly service, excellent pasta, what's not to love?! Came on a Monday night for their $10 pasta deal (without reservations) and was lucky enough to be seated at the bar with hardly a wait.  Loved being able to watch the preparation of the deserts and appetizers from where we were sitting.  What we ordered: - Tagliatelle - this is always our go-to order.  Never disappoints. Highly recommend. - Creamy pasta with peas (forgot the name) - incredibly flavorful.  Also recommend - Cacio e pepe salad - SO GOOD. perfect start to the meal.  menu states that its served with an anchovy dressing but can barely taste the anchovies. Can't wait to be back!",https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/evVNznxhRKEp--tqt1DDaw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NKU6UjMG21zSfwQSvNRz-Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pHt0F5MJrE27XLeYlcAErA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GQ9eOe1px9syd0T5W3f9bA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ia4yj7tA0ZT-86DaLtSBrg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7cGPerJUCXhPWMWwXvrGBA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/L2OgJLD2y7cRfuzWlrHWrQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bai0Jx9l0cCMIHUcJQJ3ow/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QgtLKffdy2rzFXK387nlVQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/i18j03g2OK1C20cG_GDyVA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uimD63IgQFl2edyX7WFl1w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/I1CeeHCNSi2E6vr9e0WDyw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XikJSHfxBmfzY7Rdxo-Djw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/B3rBDgFCMwOhvxdgUfeJcQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wVGqOrq8giBpfYSE7sAdtQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BBcpNnavGsfPoQNtMZ2i3Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/40_VjkR2_RXayFpYnldNEw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JOARFV_--AyNstc1zqxkEQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SQPrPcihkRnOkUG18zRyrg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9np0hDahT81zy-y4ZB_lPA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DnvHyd76kdGPYST56kJzKQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tObTlyd432edsyexlFWF5w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_bNjdLVYB6IbkF-TlFPPJQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fCzWIx8gJfCaK28q0jelYA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WNaC8_-U8xZRXnLHlObAkA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7-yMLoPaEZU0EveTqsc-IA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UnyNv1weZeh0uKw--pyFSQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JfZsWrEr-Tdn_KnKB50gdw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3fbqeQb4xFHN3n7DoCOscw/258s.jpg,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/parisi-bakery-new-york,parisi-bakery-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Bakeries,Sandwiches,NA,"If you put an orgasm between two slices of bread you will know the pleasure of eating here.  Sandwich-O for certain.  Those of you who know sandwich nirvana will appreciate.  I am not kidding.  If trump eats cheeseburgers in bed, it is only because he has not had the Dennis (well, and he is a sad orange man).  But behold the Dennis: thinly sliced perfectly bread chicken breasts, surrounded by Italian meat, with a delicate vinaigrette and warm homemade bread.  Everything super fresh and made to order.  Right there.  Magic.  My favorite was the Italian Combo. Meat, meat, and more meat and provolone or mozzarella that was so fresh.   Tomatoes or marinated red peppers with balsamic on the bread.  Two giant subs for around $20 bucks!! Now just find a bar to eat it in!!   LOVE it here.  We ate here two days in a row. Parisi is an unseemly gem of Little Italy/Nolita. They're known for their generous deli sandwiches, but the must have for any meat lover is the lard bread! It's available in loaf or ring form with a great crust, fluffy interior, and layers of cured meat. The first time I had it cold and this time, I asked for it to be warmed up and it was the best decision I made all week. The best thing on a chilly weekend morning.CASH ONLY This place is definitely creeping downhill. Usually get the Dennis off the NFT menu but was disappointed again for the third time. I think they may have changed the vendor for the bread/rolls because they now get soggy very fast and the sandwich is already uber messy. The chicken also use to be tender and fresh. But alas, this time the only thing moist was the soggy bread.The place is a solid 3 star lunch spot; but lack of seating, grumpy-cat counter guy and general lack of cleanliness knock off a star. Hope they get back to their usual goodness. But as of now there are a lot of better places close by, costing much less. I mean wowowoowowow. Great great sandwich. Arguably the best I have ever had. The bread was excellent - I recommend the sesame bread. They are famous for the Dennis but I got the Italian. Amazing. HUGE. so think, layered with so much meat and mozzarella and roasted red peppers. just I mean wow. Please go here. CASH ONLYYYY Real Little Italy baby. I went there for the first time on a walking tour and tried the pepperoni bread. It is simply addictive! This time, I took the lead of just about everyone and got the Dennis sandwich. Chicken cutlets, prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, pesto, and amazing balsamic on phenomenal crusty Italian bread. What a wonderful combination of flavors. I have a huge appetite, but I couldn't finish it. Definitely worth a return trip. I only wish they had tables and chairs outside, since there's no room inside to sit down and eat. So good! I got the chicken cutlet, fresh mozzarella and roasted peppers and for $12 the sandwich is huge (enough for 2 people). I didn't eat it right when I got it but I'm sure it would have been even better. My husband got the eggs and potatoes and he also loved it. I don't know which came first, Dennis the Menace the TV character or The Dennis sandwich at Parisi, but both both are an absolute handful. The Dennis sando is stacked high with a ridiculous four chicken cutlets, fresh-cut proscuitto, tomatoes, and house mozz. It's easily enough for three people to share. Add on roasted red peppers if you're planning to eat ASAP, otherwise it makes things soggy fast. I recommend getting extra pesto on the side for dipping purposes!NOTE: Cash only, ATM on site, closed Sundays, seafood specialties available on Fridays. Here's the Scoop: After reading some of the reviews I was a little apprehensive but to my surprise we came and it wasn't bad. We ordered the chicken cutlet. It was a nice sandwich in size and taste. I was pleasantly surprised. My husband enjoyed it as well. The bread was soft which is a plus. I think we would try them again.  Check them out guys. Pretty darn good sandwich. I was introduced to this small sandwich shop by a former colleague and am so glad he included my on this little secret. I get the chicken cutlet with mozzarella and roasted peppers. Nothing else, the juices from the roasted peppers soak into the bread and it's sooo so good. Things to note: it's cash only, there is no where to sit or eat so look for a bench somewhere, and eat immediately because the bread can get soggy with this particular sandwich after awhile. Plain and simple. Get the Dennis sandwich. You will not regret it.  It's the kind of deli chicken cutlet sandwich that New York should be proud of. One sandwich- two meals. My prosciutto, mozzarella, roasted red pepper, and pesto hero was piled high and amazing. Be careful of the copious amounts of raw garlic with the pesto though! They add a nice crunch but they're STRONG. It's a pretty messy sandwich and the bread did crumble a bit but still delicious the next day!I want to try the Dennis next time! Very small bakery with no space to sit. The service isn't particularly special but they was nice and fast making and packaging my order.The sandwich was amazing. I had the chicken cutlet with mozzarella and roasted peppers. It was huge, I could barely eat half. The portions are extremely generous. They don't skimp you on chicken or peppers or anything. You can also get sauces and peppers on the side and when you ask they don't act like its a huge deal like many other bakeries around the city. They also have a pretty good drink/chip selection. Just remember it's CASH ONLY. I had some reservations about going to this bakery. Would it live up to its reputation.I am glad to say this old style Italian deli does, and the Dennis is a must try for any serious sandwich lover. I have had massive chicken cutlet sandwiches at other legendary sandwich makers in Brooklyn, but it is hard to keep the sandwich moist. Parisi does an excellent job. The taste is complex and excellent.So don't be dissuaded by good reviews of other sandwich places, you must perform the haj, the pilgrimage to Parisi bang for your buck.!! Amazing sandwiches that are stuffed. Everything is fresh and delicious. Ordered The Dennis for the first time and it was everything Id thought it be. Get here early because they close at 4pm or earlier if they sell out. Favorite chicken cutlet, fresh mozz, mayo and Red pepper sub I ever had in my life. I carried the other half of the sub from spring st. to Staten Island and finished it off there. I ate every possible morsel. The bread is brilliant. If you like tiny portions that are certainly over priced please go waste your money there ;). Go to one of the actual good sandwich shops around there plus the people who work there could be much better I believe in love at first bite.. huge disclaimer i generally hate tomato sauces because I fall into the unlucky group where it leads me to get heartburn mehh:(.My co-worker was raving about this place and he always gets cold cuts and then he decided lets split a chicken parm and i was like haaaaaay why not.FIRST OF it was huge huge huge hugeee and cheap! I think it was 10? I took the first bite and holy moly love love love i felt my cheeks turn pink and warm my heart fluttering. I really hope that these sandwiches stay magically!If you are in the area you need to try it!if you arent in the area you need to get into the area and try it! These sandwhiches are monstrous and pretty damn good. Ordered the Dennis and shared with my friend, definitely filled us up for lunch.We went to eat at the park a block up and had a great time. Will be sure to come back and try another sandwich extravaganza. *CASH ONLY - $11 for the Dennis*Parisi is a 3.5 average. It was a solid 4 the first time but a sad 3 this time around. I can clearly recall my first Parisi experience and it was on one of my bad days. Upon first bite of pillowy, meaty chicken cutlets, the day was instantly better. Life felt better. It was by far the best few cutlets I've ever had in my lifespan. The prosciutto was spot-on and bountiful. I mean chicken AND cured ham in each bite? YOLO. The moz was fresh, stringy, and ooey gooey. The balsamic pesto had a hint of olive and was the perfect Dennis dressing. Parisi could easily be a five but their buns are pretty mediocre.I recently revisited Parisi on one of my good days and the Dennis was not of equivalent caliber. The WOW-factor I once experienced was missing. The cutlets were sappy and dry. Everything else remained the same but the cutlets, oh how disappointed was I in those cutlets! That was basically the deal breaker for me. P.S. If you come during lunch, expect a line! The Dennis is awesome. Gorgeous sandwich. The bread is not overpowering. The sandwich deftly combines crispy white breast patties with intense aromatic pesto, mozzarella, tomatoes and savoury prosciutto.",https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VlYBHm55Cyk8ReAAmKXMkA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_Kdnbu67GOJxZEbalHn6cw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_wKcjaaCs0z5Hb-b5wZEZw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/eVw3J-mZ2djPRc1BI3lccg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1VD2z0a4AqF7R08E2lBEuQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7fU1I9JmeODm1MJqT20qlg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QjkpAwoW3gcJJmqYtTdeCA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qA0nsMPp5ILH8-9R0T54OQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/f0VEHyIK8ZCBzuf6HqOaJg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZXFZciNwrKCe7JyodAvWqQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0M3reGxqv5nIRwIRMM1DZQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/boTrer8ccxE2iBL0nPtmWQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/i8XDB5Lzw7Gkzq8ABLN90Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qIfvNEjaQEONOgA4J-voQQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8RhmPfgZGnwXJ4UbztQTfg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TFqRRkp_K_NJGyH9tJ-dtQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ohDzOc-uW2gEQe_QRWvDcw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-PjDHX6zZkekbg3RQSjQKA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RsSPZ8GJ1NOGgCWeZhqADg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RofrV4n_pzj_j1Hp1IsVvg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gOxMsoKDmqNQCiVU2SldQQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/p0X7qEmobs9L_lOH2jK4YA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dLGW2XuMO7dQ6pf0oQIh-A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ccaqtpiAfsJibEc5aJryqw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/S6IvLGYQyiiNi7JUNNx3dA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bpjRt25GbvBJ5zGfL_-HmQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DErGVzaFdNHpJsgISPNuiw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7alCd0Gyy9d7mkfIhZuKfQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jB7mXz_S4btZ-eXAS4227A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MI7RGf5DEU4aMIu008jI-g/258s.jpg
https://www.yelp.com//biz/patacon-pisao-new-york-7,patacon-pisao-new-york-7,New York,10002,NY,Venezuelan,Sandwiches,NA,"Patacon Pisao is a tiny plantain sandwich shop in the Lower East Side that offers delicious handheld eats. This is the perfect spot to grab a quick lunch or a bite before going out for the night. I came here on a Friday night and ordered the Cubano Plantain sandwich. As someone who isn't a plantain fan, they were able to make me love this sandwich. The plantains were cooked like a thick tortilla. It is crunchy and very satisfying to sink your teeth into. The portion is generous. I shared my sandwich with a friend. I was full on just half a sandwich! They have different sauces on the counter for you to use as well. Be warned though, there are some spicy ones!While eating at the shop you can tell it is a neighborhood favorite. A lot of regulars came in and had their orders ready and waiting for them. I would definitely come back to this spot. FYI: The shop sits about 10 people, so I wouldn't recommend coming here with a large party. It was hard enough fitting out winter coats on the seats. This was my first experience with Venezuelan food!The Patacon was ok. It was supposed to have sweet plantains on it but they were very bland. I am of Jamaican decent I know a thing or two about sweet plantains.Now! The arepas..... the arepas were GOOD! I will come back just for that! The store is small but has good character and the employees are extremely nice. After a long day of exploring the city, we decided to swing by for dinner. This place was on my radar for a while because of their patacons, fried plantain ""sandwiches"". Upon entering, we noticed the place was super small - definitely not good for large groups. There is enough seats/tables to fit about 8 people comfortably. I was there with 2 people and we took up like half the sitting space.We ordered the burger patacon (with avocado), half chicken/beef patacon, and yuca fries. The total came out to ~$30. That's honestly A LOT and more than I expected it would be. It took about 15 minutes to get our food.The patacons were honestly great. The flavor was there and the meats were seasoned well. My only complaint is the patacon itself was slightly hard to bite into. In addition, it is fairly dry but they had 3 different sauces to help with that. The sauces were delicious. We pretty much killed the bottles of salsa rosada (pink color) and salsa verde (green color) - sorry not sorry! I didn't try the hot salsa but that is also an option.The yuca fries were definitely one of the better ones I've had and it is served with a side of crumbled cheese and chimichurri sauce. I tried it with and without the toppings, and it really is fine either way. I personally prefer it with anything added.It was a great meal to end a long day but $30 for 2 people was a bit much for this kind of place. I would recommend trying this place out but I definitely won't be a regular here! I'm coming back here. I refuse to let one experience shape how I feel about this place. The cashier was polite and helpful. I struggled with ordering. I went with the patacon with just chicken. Didn't alter it at all (should have.) We sat down and the cashier brought us our food. The outer shell is so tough. 3 different types of sauce. Mint, chitpole, and hot I believe. You desperately need the sauces. The sandwich itself is so dry. So while you're drenching the sandwich with sauce, you realize there is no restroom. But they do give you like sanitizer wipes. I'll be back and order a wider range of dishes. First frazzled experience shouldn't deter me from a potential good experience. Filling yet inexpensive eats? YES for ~$10 this place will get you full but the food is nothing spectacular.Food - I came here wanting to try their Patacon (plantain sandwiches) and so I ordered a cubano and de pabellon. Appearance wise, they don't look the most appetizing but I promise you it tastes better than it looks. Between the two, I enjoyed the cubano more because it was juicier and had more flavor whereas the Patacon de pabellon was bland and dry. It's a must that you grab some of the sauces they offer because it was the added kick of flavor that these sandwiches needed.Service - The staff was friendly and helpful!Atmosphere - It's a very small shop with a couple small tables. Expect to sit for a quick bite and go. There's also no bathroom. I haven't left so satisfied from a restaurant in quite some time. I happened to have a craving for Venezuelan when my friend and I were in the neighborhood.At Patacon Pisao you place your order at the counter and bus your own table - there is maybe space enough to seat 8. It' is a small joint. I highly recommend a custom grilled arepa with avocado, maduros and shredded chicken, while my friend declared her reina pepia to be authentic - and you cannot forget a side of tequeno! delicious Venezuelan comfort food in the form of patacons, tacucho, cachapa, &amp; arepas!the food here has that home-cooked street food taste &amp; feel: filling and savory.this is an uber small eater. there are 3-4 2-seaters on the left, a small ledge on the right to stand and eat, and a small counter in the back for ordering/pay/and pickup. the space is super small but uses the space efficiently. the exposed brick decor is stripped-down, simple, bright, and clean with a few modern flourishes. most business is grab-n-go &amp; delivery. tables turn fast. this is not a place to camp out, eat and go.i really enjoy the food offerings here. the food feel homemade/comfy. for first-timers, try the patacons: plantain patties as bread with hearty mix of meats, sauce, and extras. eat them hot. don't dilly dally.i am a big fan of the ""BLaTin""-- bacon, avocado slices, lettuce, tomatoes, and salsa verde. the ""cubano"" is a hefy sandwich: ham, roasted pork, fried cheese, pickles, and salsa verse. you can't go wrong with any of the signature sandwiches or making your own.if you're in the mood for the ""tacucho"" (burrito), then try the ""Bueno Dias""--eggs, chorizo, beans, melted cheese, and more. comforts of breakfast-y eats that can be ordered all day. the ""mexican"" arepa is EXCELLENT.most of the main eats are under $10. great food at a great value. the maduros (sweet plantains) are YUM and only ~$5.there are a variety of soft beverages: juices, sodas and water. no booze.dessert? tres leches or quesillo.the staff? friendly and full of suggestions if you're paralyzed by choice or new to these eats.drops mic cuz these patacons got me patting my bellyi outzzz I came in on a windy day and was greeted by the chef. He informed us that the cashier wasn't here so we would have to order through the website or through seamless. No big deal. While we stood there ordering through the website, he asked if it was our first time here and explained the most popular items. He then offered us some fresh hot cheese sticks on the house. Super nice of him and didn't expect it.Within minutes, our food was served to us. We ordered the Patacon sandwiches and they did not skimp out on the meat. Every bite was packed with flavor and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. It was so filling, I couldn't finish my second half. I asked for a piece of aluminum to wrap up my sandwich and the chef quickly put on some gloves and offered to wrap it for me so my hands wouldn't get dirty. Food and service was great! Will definitely be back! Hmm not sure if it's just cause I had high expectations coming in, or maybe I just simply wasn't a fan, but Patacon let me down... I have been planning a drunken night to come try Patacon after seeing stellar reviews, and finally made it out. I ordered the Patacon (plantain sandwich) with shredded chicken as my filling, and added some jalapenos as well. Each sandwich comes with fried queso blanco, lettuce, tomatoes, ketchup &amp; salsa verde. I was expecting to be hit with delicious and unique flavors, especially since it was 1AM and I was experiencing major drunchies. But to my disappointment, the patacon was nothing unique--chicken was mediocre, the fix-ins were nothing unique, and I actually preferred a tortilla or even arepa to the thick, and slightly dry plantains. And to be honest, on any other day I love plantains.If I had to say what the star of the dish was, it'd have to be the salsa verde--odd though that they make theirs with mayo. All in all I will probably stick to Stanton Pizza or Essex Taqueria after a night out. I must say though the chicken tasted good mixed up with my leftover rice and topped off with sriracha back home. I came here wanting to try there infamous patacon sandwich! And I'll say it's definitely worth trying. The patacon sandwich, for those who don't know is basically a sandwich that instead of having bread it has flattened and fried Plantains that marries all the deliciousness in between.  This place in particular really makes good ones! I love that you can either customize them or order a premade one. And you can choose between having meat in it, or having no meat, getting cheese or getting no cheese, adding avocados (why wouldn't you add avocados?) Also when you get this, it will be hot so be cautious and it's not pre-cut... I think that's the only thing I wish they did, but I'm pretty sure if you ask they would do, it I don't see why they wouldn't. Staff here is also super friendly and so yeah overall great food and great vibes! Will definitely be coming back To start, this review is a combination of 2 separate opinions. I would personally give it 4 stars, while my well traveled friend (she does actually know great, authentic tasting food), would give it 0 stars-she said it was a waste of money and would never return. Therefore, I decided to give it 3 stars, erring on the side of more generous. We shared the grilled beef arepa and the de pabellon.I personally liked it. Our grilled arepa was very fresh and light. The ""crepe"" is like the typical heavier Latin options. Considering I don't know what authentic venezuelan food is, I would be happy to return. The price wasn't too bad considering it's manhattan. However, my friend said the corn crepe was far too thin compared to authentic food. It should be made mostly with corn and use flour(? Or something like that) to help bind everything, but it was mostly dough flecked with minimal amounts of corn kernels.In my opinion, this place seems reminiscent to Chipotle in that while it may not be authentic, this alien is happy with it. I heard about this place from a friend and thought it seemed interesting enough to schlep out from LIC to pay it a visit.  It's a relatively small shop (though there are a couple tables for dining-in) pumping out some yuge Venezuelan flavor! I decided to go with their namesake - a patacon (a sandwich with fried plantains replacing the bread) and went with the Patacon Paisa, which comes with grilled steak, chorizo, avocado, sunnyside up egg, ketchup and salsa verde.  This thing was pretty massive!  It tasted great as I got through half of my sandwich, but towards the end, it just felt a bit heavy with the fried plantains n fairly decadent stuffings.  I opted to go open-faced on the remainder and successfully put the beast down.  Very very yummy and great hearty flavors, but can get a little taxing by the end. I'd definitely recommend the spot, though, and would try their other offerings (including a cachapa - a type of sweet corn crepe).P.S. - load/stock up on their sauces! Delicious and fairly priced for NYC Venezuelan food. What's great is the pretty diverse menu with some typical Venezuelan players like patacones, arepas, cachapas and a wide variety of fillings. The portion is HUMONGOUS. Service is a delight! They're super friendly and attentive. Chefs would come to the table to make sure you feel good about the food. Gringos would love this place too because the ingredients and flavors can be adjusted to their taste. I wish they had empanadas but overall a great place for a meet up with a friend or two. I made it with 14 mins to spare before they closed. Winning!!!!!! The grill closes at 1 so keep that in mind.  I ordered a Patacon Pabellon.  It's a sandwich ( no bread but 2 slices of fried green plantains) filled with black beans, shredded beef, sweet plantain and queso fresco. Try the green sauce, it goes perfectly w the yummy sammich.  The only mistake I made and I regret it now, was to share it with my fianc. We both wanted more. It was a perfect sandwich to have before heading home. Oh and the fresh passion fruit juice was yummy too! The restaurant is very small and only has a few small tables. Enjoy!!!! Great Yelp find! Ordered the veggie Patacon sans cheese and it was quite tasty! I should have gotten some sauces for sure though as it was a bit full at times. Also I've never had a patacon before so take this review with that in mind.Def grab extra napkins and don't put the to go bag straight in your bag like I did because it's GREASY.Would def re-visit.You order at the counter and there's a few tables if you want to eat there. Very small and cool looking place. I had the Cubano Tacucho which is less than $10. Good amount of food for the cost.The place is not meant for sit in and more for take out. Restaurant is small with seating for 8-10 people. Also there is no restroom. Service is great. Cashier offered to help with menu questions and food was brought over to the table despite the lack of walking space. I've been here several times and the food is great. The space itself is pretty small with only a few tables, so if you can snag a table, definitely do so. They specialize in traditional Venezuelan sandwiches, and you can order one off their menu or build your own. They also have a few other sandwich options and a burrito option you can choose as well. The staff who work here are super friendly and I'd highly recommend coming here if in the area and searching for a delicious, yet not bank breaking meal. Extremely delicious!! We ordered Patacon paisa, Cachapa de pabellon, and some yucas fritas! We split it so we could try both, it was perfect! The people there are so nice and friendly! Definitely going back again with more friends I think I've found the place for some good fries! The yucca fries here!! They're beyond the regular level of usual fries. Usually fries are like a snack and not something that would fill me up. And the yucca fries here, it looks like a small portion of yucca fries but it can actually fill you up, at least for me, but I would still get a second order. Yes, it's that good. The texture is a bit different than potatoes (it's made from the yucca root), not as mushy as potatoes in fries. There's more substance to this. They come with some cheese you can sprinkle on top and a side of green sauce. For my the cheese was all I needed, I personally did not think the green sauce complimented the rich buttery taste of the yucca fries. Two friends and I decided to come here after a long search for a lunch place. One friend has been here before and she suggested this place and I have to say it didn't disappoint. I will definitely be back for more yucca fries and other things on their menu. Besides the yucca fries we got to share amongst the three of us, we each got different things. I got the el gringo burrito (tacucho), which I felt lacked a bit in its own department. It was loose when I got it and a little bit anorexic like. The one I got I guess wasn't anything special, it had chicken, bacon, lettuce and tomato. It was good but really nothing special. I used their verde and rosado sauces and I prefer the latter as it was a bit similar to tartar sauce and a bit spicy to it. The sauce went well with my burrito and the yucca fries when I decided to combine the two. My friends for the patacon and cachapa, both looking huge in portion and they ended up not being able to finish their orders. Both orders looks stuffed and packed. I will probably try one of those next time I come back.The price for everything was decent and the lady who took my order was friendly. Once you order, you can sit and they bring your food on a tray to your table. It's a small place with a few tables and can seat around 10 people. Came here for the patacon sandwich!!! I love all plantains so learning it could be made into sandwich patties made my stomach and heart VERY excited. I made my own with steak, egg, jamon, lettuce, tomato and it was amazing -- they have three sauces you can use to make it pop even more. Technically this is a 'cheap eat' but once you build your own patacon and add avocado or an egg it ends up totaling around $12, so still cheap but not as cheap as I expected haha. My friend got the cubano burrito, other friend tried the vegetarian patacon and we all really enjoyed our food. However if you're vegetarian the experience here may be a little less exciting since what really stands out here is the meat and how it brings all the fatty / crispy / crunchy bits together.",https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_G35iGLA9b3rT9anbwc9_w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hOWx-bDWHitfNyeuppEdNQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tLA5MoIGPtVqH6x0tD-mfw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZH5OxMXFYn7jOVqZT46FGw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2nYFKqqHY-2spMzpPjlIPw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lXeVsEOnqMAtr0nmIL2TCQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/T6fneECLXuxxC0oHdDCzaQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/T6dVTixfSdUAI7OCcrFq_w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_F3l4msYdhntLnNU9eIEgw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DPAoSWIqow9ljwSVJVXzcA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TeGXgzVaIZ-pfm_QsKylgA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vN3Sh6gco0vhk8KOn1ZEFw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EMtNiF7p7N_pgWbyJnnkxQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/epGBPxPFS_q_z2jwqmhnrA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-KnwdrrZoTzcvmkMQzLApw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_EB1aB556mX6Y1HRtdqlCg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kFyJIxBpYeuEKePJVwhiRw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tAcs2eFPzQlhRV7Dqu22xg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OPxOe-dZI0KfIGcHOB5JjQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uFh3vqui0RBVMl3BXODwhA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OACJxRaVTeCMzJ07zRAWvg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pZdFI4AiT4oNmM1P-662CA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JJlatjgGKweinHNP9FTiZg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Hh8vMbcHtlgZaXKXcsBe1w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hdeWSFOFC7Ijj_Dz0Lgi6Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gQGqiaE1kzs0Y9iLaaXZ-w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9Jb8FesxyslAHxh9RE7bsA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7Ba3FXVlmBbony_pIhE1Yg/258s.jpg,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/peasant-stock-new-york-2,peasant-stock-new-york-2,New York,10002,NY,Soup,NA,NA,"Super delicious soups bursting with flavor and complexity. The cold soups in the summer are excellent too. Cool little soup spot inside Essex market. Offers about a handful of different soup everyday and in two sizes. They also have pretty great cornbread and dessert cookies.The carrot ginger soup is pretty nice and has a light heat that is great for a chilly day outside. Cornbread is pretty hearty and for me, not as big as I'd like. Note, I love breads with my soup, so it might be decent in size for others. The cookies are small and light which is great after a cup of heavy soup and a solid cornbread chunk. 1.00 cars minimum, which is to say you can't buy a single cookie on a card (.85 cents per cookie).Prices are very reasonable and although many don't count soup as a lunch (me included) this I think will. It's not a heavy lunch like a steak would be but it will keep you filled till dinner time rolls around.Service is nice too, lines go fast and plenty of seating in the market. I stopped in for a cup of soup on a surprisingly cold October afternoon. The curry cauliflower and carrot soup was very good and was served piping hot. I think the smallest size was around $5. Good stuff! DELICIOUS vegan yellow split pea soup. I go out of my way to go here for soup. Great homemade tasting soups. Tucked away inside a little grocery market, you'll not only find a few aisles of produce, but you'll also find some little food stands. Once you meander around the market and find Pleasant Stock, you'll notice that it's not much to look at, just a few pots on a stove behind the counter. But in the soup game, it's all about what's inside those pots! I had the Spicy Chickpea and Tomato Soup. And my oh my, I felt like I could cry! So good! A hole in the wall inside Essex Street Market where magical, delicious soup is made in its little teeny tiny kitchen. Different menu each day! SO good! I'm addicted to this place...came here 6 days straight when I discovered this place. definitely a must try soup spot, especially if you're on a gluten free/vegan diet. (small $5, large $6/6.25) they let you sample their soup too. their buckwheat bread is awesome too but you have to get there early for it...they sell out quick. this place is located inside the Essex Market. I stopped in to try Peasant Stock's soup because of the great reviews...and I just love soup. Soups are $5 for small and $6 for large. They had flavors like Carrot Ginger Vegan soup, Chilled Avocado soup, but I had the chicken orzo because it was the only one with protein. While it was OK, I wouldn't say it was amazing. I feel like it's just regular chicken orzo soup that I cook at home but at least I didn't have to cook it. I'll need to try one of the other vegan soups next time. These are flavorful, hearty handmade soups, spiced just right. You get all the joys of wonderful soup just like a Mom who is a really good cook would make without the complication of actually having to visit Mom. This place is a hidden gem in the Essex Market.  We stopped in one afternoon for a light meal.  The soup is fantastic.  The maple bacon cornbread is addictive.  Service was very friendly.   Even our 6 and 10 year old kids ate their soup.  That is unheard of!  Thanks for adding to our NYC trip experience and we hope places like this stick around for years to come. Their $0.85 double chocolate cookies are shockingly exquisite, and perhaps the best thing we ate during the 2016 Essex Block Party. really good. I'm greedy so i bought two: Smoky Eggplant Tomato Soup with organicQuinoa and the Chilled Avocado Cucumber Soup. delish. i would most definitely recommend this spot especially if you are a soupy like me. didn't know how i would feel about a cold soup either but it was good. This is an old review from the winter that just got finished:  Tasty, fresh and affordable. What's not to like?  I had the carrot ginger soup and it was very good.  Assuming this place is still in biz, it's worth a trip, particularly in the cold weather! Very deserving of its 5 star average. Well done soup at a reasonable price. Very good corn bread. Vegan and gluten free options Delicious soup. I've been here multiple times and it has never disappointed! Cornbread and croutons are excellent too, but you don't need them to bulk up the soup - it's amazing on its own. There aren't many places in that strictly do soup and Peasant Stock is one, and does it extremely well! Its a bit hidden away in the back left corner of Essex market so you might have to make a round before you come across it. Basically its a tiny stall with a lady who makes some kick ass soup and a small assortment of cookies and baked goods. The soup rotates on a daily basis so you're sure to get something new. Everything is freshly prepared on a kitchen stove like you'd see at home so it has a comfortable feel from the start. We tried the asparagus, leek, and potato soup and got a large to share between two of us. Picked up some bread from Pain dAvignon next door which was killer too. About the soup... Im not a soup person really but WOW was it tasty! Super creamy, obviously lacking preservatives, not over-salted like most soups from the can, and went exceedingly well when paired with the bread to dip it in. It all tasted very fresh and clean and happy and would have even gone well as a sauce for chicken or something. Great for a cold blustery NYC day! And a large soup wasnt even that expensive... About $6 give or take depending what you get.We will absolutely be back - and soon! Making this place a go-to this winter! Peasant Stock is exactly what I had been told.  They're a small stand in the Essex Market, serving up some of the best soups I've had in recent memory.  You'll find them at the back left of the market, in a totally unassuming nook.  Every time I've been, it's been the same two women, and they're always super friendly.  You order, your order is served to you immediately and you can go sit at some of the tables in the general market area.  At this point, I stick to the same order.  I get the spicy veggie chili with a piece of cornbread.  The chili is hearty and filling.  It lives up to its spicy designation, providing a pleasantly intense heat.  The cornbread is a perfect compliment and is great for dipping.My only wish is that they had a brick and mortar location, rather than being in the sterile market.  Their soups make me wish I were sitting in an armchair, in a cozy caf.  Instead, I sit in a cold, open market as I devour my chili.  Hopefully they move to a standalone location soon though!  Peasant Stock is definitely worth the trip for some great soup at reasonable prices. In the back of the Essex Street Market lies a treasure beyond belief, Peasant Stock. Let me say that before I tried the soup here, I would only eat soup if I was sick. Now it's something of a tradition.I'll start with the product. They use the freshest ingredients and make their soups every morning fresh. I've had creamy roasted tomato basil, creamy potato leek, pasta fagoli, chicken and wild rice and so many more and they all (A) fill me up and (B) taste delicious. Oh and they are all affordable, which in this city is something quite rare. Oh again, this food is healthy for you, wow.Lastly, I will share with you the charm and spirit of Christine (the owner) and Emma (her daughter). They are so friendly and attentive to you. I've seen them both deal with their fair share of annoying customers asking for things so outrageous and time consuming that most people would lose patience for but not these two. They truly give you service with a smile, no matter how annoying and unruly you are (don't be a jerk and take advantage of that).I guess in summation you could say I rather enjoy this establishment and I will be going back on a regular basis as should you.Sorry, Peasant Stock. They only let me give out five stars. Had lentil soup for lunch and it was good not great. It was over run with lentils and really could use salt and pepper. Price is good..but go the bakery for super quality dipping bread. Simple, delicious and beautiful. I got the cream of broccoli soup today.

https://www.yelp.com//biz/pepe-rosso-social-new-york-2,pepe-rosso-social-new-york-2,New York,10002,NY,Italian,NA,NA,"This is a such a cute little restaurant. I like the homey feel to it. Their food is delicious and very authentic. I tried their black linguine with seafood...it was very tasty. Mussels, clams, shrimp, salmon...a great combination. Complimenti alla cuoca! They also have great service. They seated us very quickly, even though we were few minutes late for our reservation. That's a plus. The waiter also stopped by our table a few times and refilled our water without us having to ask...verbally or through trying to make eye contact with the waiter to get their attention. That can always be a bit annoying. Bravo to the service!Definitely plan to come here again. Next time I'll try their sauted striped bass. Imagine this - its winter in NYC and we are in the midst of a deep freeze.  I'm traversing along Mott Street, looking for a warm place to sit and put food in my grumbling belly.  The wind is unforgiving, I'm pretty sure my fingers are frost bitten.  Chapped lips and wind burned face...I look into a window and see a welcoming intimate restaurant.  BOOM - inside Pepe Rosso Social.  I arrived on a Friday with my mom and fiance after a morning of some sightseeing on what was probably one of the coldest days of the year.  We were given a table and some menus.  This place is just DARLING, from the tin roofs to the exposed brick walls.  Its very cozy and romantic and I could imagine Loretta Castorini and Rony Cammareri enjoying the black fettucine in a corner with a glass of lambrusco.We ordered a liter of red wine and the calamari appetizer.  They brought out some bread in a cute metal colander and some olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  To say we housed the bread would be an understatement.  I ordered the oxtail pappardelle, my fiance the penne vodka with chicken and my mother the chicken al limone.  My pappardelle was to die for. The pasta is definitely home made and the soft tender pieces of oxtail we so well seasoned and tasty that I could easily eat that every day for a week.  We topped our meals with some cappuccinos and the ricotta cheesecake with amaretto crust.We left the restaurant happy and well fed.  What a great gem this restaurant is. A little disappointing for sure. I spent weeks planning our trip to NYC and this stop was not fulfilling. Fellow Yelpers have rated it high but our experience was blahh. I'm Italian and it's always hard to satisfy me when dining within my culture. Here's what was poor: shell steak was horrible. Full of fat and gristle and could not chew.. They made it right by taking it off our bill and giving us an alternative. The chicken limone was satisfactory. A little too much lemon rind flavor. The pasta dish that I had was not even on par for being homemade. The marinara did not stand out and was a bit slimy and bland. The desserts saved the experience. Nutella tiramisu and ricotta cheese cake. Also our waiter was very helpful and nice. He never made us feel uncomfortable even though he knew that we were not very happy. There are definitely more authentic places. Do your research. I had fond memories of Pepe Rosso both from To Go, which I frequented when I lived in Soho, and Social, which I had been to only once before. After our original Nolita plans were scuttled (Uncle Boons and Rubirosa, when will you cool off enough for me to come!), this was a reliable back up. We had no problem walking in around 7 on a Friday, though those arriving after us had to wait.Decor is nothing special but there was a festive atmosphere. The menu, though well-priced, is a visual monstrosity-- someone should offer their graphic design (and web) services as an act of charity.I had a glass of white, which was shockingly good for its price of $8. My boyfriend's glass of $9 red was also decent. I wish they served it in something other than water glasses, though.We started with the mushroom bruschetta ($10), which was great. It was truffle-y without tasting artificial or overwhelming. Nice cheese.For mains, I did the black fettuccine with shrimp ($18), and my boyfriend did the pappardelle with oxtail ragu ($17). The texture of both was on point-- fettuccine was a touch softer than al dente (which I like), and pappardelle was soft and great. The spicy tomato sauce on mine was perfect (though too much in quantity), and the ragu was good, though they could have been more generous on the meat. The shrimp was really blah, and I didn't want to finish it.They seated us by the door, which really ended up sinking this occasion for me. Lots of people coming and going, and they never even closed the velvet curtains, so we were in the cold most of the second half of the meal.Pacing of the meal was not great-- we waited quite a while for our wine (20+ minutes). In addition, we asked for the check when they were clearing our plates, and about ten minutes later a guy wandered over offering us dessert menus, though we managed to get the check after that. Given how slow things had been, we ended up slightly overpaying with cash so we could get out of there. We were really cold. It ended up taking about an hour and a half. I think they may be overwhelmed with trying to run Cantina downstairs as well.The food is good and cheap(er) for New York, and I like how they're trying to do it classic with some attitude. But thinking back to how we were literally wearing our coats in the restaurant, I'll skip it in the winter. Every time my boyfriend and I are trying to figure out what the heck to eat in this glorious melting pot of a city, I know one thing is certain--I ain't picking Italian. Now, don't get me wrong, I LOVE me some Italian food, but for some reason, *most* places I've tried in the city have just been mediocre in that effing-a-I-totally-could-have-made-that-at-home-myself-goddammit-dafkjdl;fjads;lfjadslkfj kind of way so I'm never one to suggest it because who wants to spend $$ on something they can make for like 5 buckaroos at home? So when my boyfriend told me he was in the mood for Italian and wanted to check out Pepe Rosso Social, I of course served him some major side-eye.I totally regret doing so now because hot damn, the food at Pepe Rosso Social was freaking DELISH and I sure as hell couldn't make any of the things we ate. We started off with the Fried Calamari + Zucchine and the Wild Mushroom Truffle Bruschetta, both of which I would order again in a heartbeat. The calamari and zucchini were lightly fried (which I much prefer over deeply fried) and perfectly salted while the bruschetta was just super flavorful and tasty. I then had the Penne Tre Porcellini (but opted for the fresh fettuccine instead) and oh my gosh, it was creamy, meaty, carby perfection (giggity). I couldn't get enough of the pancetta, prosciutto and my favorite of the three, the spicy sausage. Combined with the creaminess of the pasta, the dish was hands down one of the best Italian dishes I have ever eaten. My boyfriend got the Fettuccine with Wild Mushrooms + Truffle Oil which was also equally flavorful and delicious. While the food was absolutely fantastic, the service was unfortunately not and it is because of this that I have to give Pepe Rosso Social a 4. Several times during our meal when we finished our waters, we would ask our waiter for a refill only to be left with empty glasses until we asked a second time. Not only that but after we asked for a refill the first time around, every time we asked thereafter was met with a scowl. Now, I know that my boyfriend and I are some thirsty mofos and drink a lot of water, but we didn't think the negative 'tude was necessary. All in all, however, my boyfriend and I had a pretty dang good time at Pepe Rosso Social. Needless to say, I actually might be the one to suggest Italian to my boyfriend next time around. Cute little place and great for a date night! We got the octopus salad, chicken al Limone, and black fettuccine with salmon.Black fettuccine with salmon was probably my favorite. It was refreshing to have a seafood option for the pasta dish, other than shrimp or clams. The lemon chicken dish was pretty average with a cut of chicken and grilled veggies.Octopus salad had good chunks of octopus as well as sausage so that was a nice touch. Good service good food.We had tagliattelle mushrooms, gnocchi and mussels as starter.Everything was delicious and portions good.Love it!!!! After an early foot massage which I will discuss in a following review, my sister &amp; I were ready for lunch/brunch. We walked a few doors down and stumbled upon this little gem. We were kindly greeted by Alpha, he was very warm and welcoming,  he quickly sat us in the the warmest part of the restaurant since, we were coming in from the cold. He immediately brought over the menu and he even suggested a few dishes for my question asking, inquisitive sister. I saw the brunch menu and immediately gravitate towards that, then even further eye opening some of the menu items begin at $4.99, say what?!?? In New York City, that seems impossibly unrealistic!!! Well it was real &amp; I did order $4.99 brunch which included two eggs any style, toast, potatoes, and a salad. I added avocado for an additional $2. I also ordered the orange juice in which I asked Alpha, if it contain any alcohol because it was rather good and distinctive in taste. He assured me no alcohol was involved in the making, it was just good freshly squeezed OJ. I was totally satisfied with my super inexpensive meal. The house dressing was really good as well. The complementary bread and oil is a winner too. My sister ordered the chicken parm with penne, it was huge. The pasta was perfectly cooked &amp; the sauce was delicious. Overall, solid place for really good pasta, sauce, &amp; super inexpensive brunch menu. The place is cozy with cool rustic decor. The staff is friendly. Nice little recently discovered gem that I will return to often with friends. Found this place on Yelp as, for some reason, I don't have a go-to Italian spot when people visit. But I'd like to think I've got a go-to now until I find a better one! (!) WHAT I GOT: Penne tre porcellini ($17); fiancee and her friend got a pappardelle each ($17). Also, free bread. (Free-ninety-nine).(!) HOW IT DID: If we're talking about ordering choices, I won this time. I enjoyed my dish more than my fiance's pappardelle. The penne tre porcellini has small penne noodles with pancetta, prosciutto and spicy sausage. Cream sauce was delicious, and my only regret is that I didn't take more meat with each bite as I had a LOT more meat at the end hehe. Pappardelle had oxtail ragu, and, by itself, was great... just didn't compare to my dish hehe. (!) HOW THE FREE BREAD DID: This deserves its own note because Italian places usually hook you up with the free bread. I ran some experiments and they *do* give you more free bread if you ask. However, it's just plain ol' bread it seems. It's not toasted or anything and we didn't ask for any butter... but they do give you the olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette combo. Big ups for that.(!) SEATING: A fair amount of seating inside the restaurant--it looked pretty empty when we came in around 7:30ish as walk-ins. They asked us if we had made a reservation and said they could make room. As far as I could tell, they didn't seem too booked up haha. (!) TIDBITS: It's a nice, quirky little place with great ambience. Overall, you can't go wrong coming here. If you're reading this, by the time of this writing they have Yelp Reservations, so feel free to save your spot there. Overall a nice environment for 1, date night... or 2, a nice place to catch up with friends. Pasta the way it should be done, simple, al dente, and with enthusiasm (the menu is really cute, tells you there's no Diet Coke, no skim milk, no decaf coffee, only good food!).The first time I came I got a special with penne pasta, mushrooms, and salmon with a garlic &amp; olive oil sauce. Not my fave but it was a special and I did substitute artichoke for mushrooms, so I probably wasn't getting the full flavor experience! They were very accommodating to the substitution - but after this, pasta dishes shouldn't be messed around with imo :pI LOVED my friend's agnolotti with pear, mascarpone, and walnut in butter &amp; sage sauce. Big generous pieces of agnolotti and the flavors of the fillings were just perfectly paired with the simple sauce.We also shared a classic mozzarella, tomato and basil bruschetta. Super fresh tomatoes, large piece of crunchy grilled bread, and divineeee chunk of mozz! Worth it.For dessert, my friend and I checked in on yelp for the free dessert, we opted for the berry panna cotta and it was everything we didn't know we needed, creamy and only slightly sweet, perfect with the homemade tart berry jam!Today I stopped in for their $10 lunch special that comes with daily soup or salad and a limited choice of pastas/paninis. I actually ordered the rigatoni with eggplant and ricotta but they gave me rigatoni in vodka sauce with pancetta, tomatoes, and arugula (on the menu this dish was stated as with penne). I took one bite, realized it wasn't what I ordered, but decided not to change it because it was delicious (plus I didn't want to waste food). I'll just have to come back another time! I chose soup and today's special was a very simple minestrone with tons of vegetables, the mild soup balanced the flavors of the saltier and creamy pasta. The pasta was perfectly al dente and ughhh so good!Service has always been great here, I informed them of the messed up order after I paid and told them it was delicious anyway and my server offered me coffee which I declined, but how nice! Pasta here is CLASSIC Italian style and their lunch special can't be beat. The portion was great, it may look small but was super filling! I'll be back for sure. This is my favorite restaurant in Little Italy - prices are reasonable, the service is great, and the food is incredible. The complimentary bread they provide is soft and filling, especially since they refill the basket when empty. The pasta is the best I've ever tried so far in NYC - we had their penne tre porcellini (pancetta, prosciutto, and spicy sausage in cream sauce) and clam linguine. The pasta is cooked al dente, and the sauces, meat, and seafood complemented the two dishes perfectly. The restaurant is dimly lit, cozy, and romantic, making this a great place for a date. Also loved that the entryway was filled with potted plants and succulents, giving off a warm and welcoming feel. I have been visiting the Sullivan location for many years and since we were in Lil Italy tried their other location for a change rather than another well known place nearby. We were a larger party and got seated very quickly and service was spotless. The food overall was good, probably not as good as their other location, but was good. We had a diversity of plates and the majority, except for one plate (lamb), came out well.The only negative we fell in with was the use of the Yelp app. It provides for a free desert per couple and I tried redeeming it and was told that it wasn't for Friday's. The app didn't say anything but I wasn't going to argue. Additionally I related there were three Birthdays in the group and still nothing. I'm surprised since usually I get treated better in the latter location, even if they are half the size. I'm not one to ever make a bigger deal over things, but wish there would have been a better personable experience for an out of town customer that visits so frequently. Overall a great location with good food, but I still prefer their Sullivan spot for better tasting food. Arrived around 8:30 on a Thursday and we were able to be seated immediately, which was nice. However, it was absolutely BOILING inside - it was an exceptionally hot day and all of the windows were open so obviously AC wouldn't have been efficient, but seriously when it's that hot close the damn windows and crank it. My friend and I ordered a bottle of Lambrusco ($34) and it was served to us in, like, water glasses, which was just bizarre. And yes, I know Lambrusco can be served in tumblers but that's not what these were. Did the restaurant not have proper glassware? Very strange. It was also chilled more than it should have been. For such a cheap bottle of wine though I can't complain too much.We shared the fried calamari and zucchini to start, which I didn't like at all. The calamari was really, really chewy and not tender at all, the breading was kinda gross and soggy and the whole thing was too salty. For our entrees, I ordered the Penne Tre Porcellini (pancetta, prosciutto, and sausage in cream sauce) - $17, and my friend had one of the nightly specials, which was gnocchi in a pesto sauce - $19. In this place's defense, the pastas were delicious and the one thing they did right. However, portion sizes were, as many other Yelpers have said, fairly small. I wasn't starving so it was okay, but definitely a lot smaller than I'm used to for Italian. For dessert, we split the flourless chocolate cake (free with a Yelp check-in), which was very, very MEH. I expect flourless cakes/tortes/whatever to be really dense, and it was oddly not. It honestly tasted like regular chocolate cake from a mix. Service was fine, but not enough to earn a third star. TL;DR: Excellent pastas but rather small portions. No other reason to come. Will not return. I came here with a friend and I was satisfied. The service is really good and they aren't overbearing even though its a relatively small restaurant. We ordered the calamari and it was delicious. I order this almost every time and this was one of the best i had in a while. The waiter recommended the Penne Vodka and he was right. It was absolutely delicious!!! I would rate it among the best Ive had and comparable to pasta I've had in Italy. I brought Chicken Milanese back for my boyfriend and he enjoyed it. I also had their Nutella Tiramisu and it was delicious. It wasn't overwhelming. However, the only reason this place didn't get a five star is my personal preference for creme brle. Theirs is a lavender creme brle and the taste of lavender is extremely overwhelming. Made it borderline unappealing. However, I would highly recommend this place. This little place ticked away on Mott street is delicious!The service here was very kind, personable, and professional. This is a small little establishment. Reservations may be needed during peak hours. The service is excellent. Greeted us upon arrival, seated us right away, had drinks and appetizers on the tables very quickly.The food had great flavor! Exactly what you would expect in authentic Italian food. Unfortunately, they don't have their liquor license. So beer and wine only....no limoncello,'if you are into that. :)Pricing is very affordable too. Nice little ambiance and Italian decor. So really good food, great service, affordable pricing, and a nice environment....we would definitely come here again. I came here on a Friday night and it was definitely busy. We had reservations for 8PM but they don't seat you until your entire party was there. We were waiting on one friend for a while but they were still very accommodating and let us sit 30 minutes past our time. It is a small place on the upper level and apparently there's a lower level as well. We started off with some appetizers for the table. The pear salad and the mushrooms with bruschetta were very tasty. I ordered the papardelle with oxtail ragu which i liked. It very much so tasted like oxtail but the sauce could use a little more flavor. The pasta was well cooked and that's super important to me. Three of my friends had the fettucini with mushrooms and they thought that was pretty bland and the pasta was undercooked. Price was actually surprisingly decent. With appetizers, a bottle of wine and our entrees, it came out to $35 pp including tax and tip. All and all, it's an OK restaurant but you can definitely do better in Little Italy. Came here with a buddy today because this place has great reviews. The food is excellent, but I really wish there had been a review that touched on the price to potion ratio. I was pretty disappointed to learn that the bowls are pretty small... I hadn't expected to pay $17 for a relatively small dish and ended up eating a ton of bread to make up for it! That said...I ordered the pappardelle oxford ragu (again, $17) and thought it was very tasty. There's a good amount of rich sauce which isn't too tomato-y, and the meat flavor from the oxtail isn't too strong. Noodles were cooked al dente, so that was nice. I had to pace myself to not devour the entire dish in just a few minutes. My buddy had the penne porcellini (which is penne pasta with pancetta, also $17) and also really enjoyed it.We were also the only ones in the restaurant at 12pm on a Saturday, so we had the server's sole attention. He was very knowledgeable on the different pastas. All good at the end of the day, but know that the dishes are on the smaller side! I love this place! It's a very strong 4.5, but they do have great, friendly service that isn't overbearing, so I'm bumping it to 5 stars.The food is delicious! I've had quite a few different things here. Scallop special: awesome! The scallops were cooked well. Buffalo mozzarella: nice start to the mealOxtail ragu pasta: this is dynamite. My first bite was electric and had my taste buds tingling. Agnolotti: delicious! It's obviously ever so slightly sweet from the pear filling. I personally wished that the dough was rolled thinner since in the crimped parts where the agnolotti is closed, it's a bit thick with dough. Chicken a lemon: delicious. I didn't try the chicken aspect, but the lemon sauce was zesty and zingy. Tiramisu: I'm not a fan of tiramisu, but theirs was delicious.Complementary bread: I wish their bread was more rustic and had more texture, but this was complementary-so no complaints! It was my first time to this place, I brought my friends here and everything went really well! I love my lobster linguine, it was delicious with that spicy tomato spice. Their bread was pretty tasty as well, since I like soft bread more! It's really good. Every time I will try the black spicy pasta. I'm sorry I forgot the name but I have photos of it :D The appetizer with tomato, cheese, and ham is also very delicious! Please try it!Good vibes for friends dinner.",https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MErF46rFrXUcnnfERnLDyw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_0ppAlboten2o9bHzDKw8A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/t6X6ut24_DYcu3jC3lDvUg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-1M7d8w1hQ3qr9firmeL0g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ynJLjnNLQQPhYrDcwEe0yg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FYLZQNjd1fZGw1uVduwd7w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tTfxVB4t79QzBnMzZVSnng/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JENmXyqSz_9eDrXPp41iVQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/iNcBSXdQNMvSnarGzgcVPg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ONl-KI9sXj5BTsVWgbjdkA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cUaidcRCY5qE2tMz-TJH5g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KVs38CjLXJvIZZO4YEbqnA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/drdh-PXJJ1Qx_ALSuBZJ1w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZnufpdFdkhXxOEb8nJSq0A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nUf2t3BIhS9ak6KcBxkHJg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/d1Xhi8RxkdapmEKy6woemA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TVXqVRRyBiwFegtpxvnaDw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1Zr6I-oDnyegM9a6MuK3Uw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/96FPND_GB69heV3GdYAu5w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BH-dahMKt7J0XoIaKOMFUw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IjQeIpBAlJ_ZaGjdh4SFkw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wtj7-9KRHJ1hRkuYnY6dBg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5IosgfmWqexfZTBGrWbW5g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/elWCJElIIvF7apTKbE66tw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3zrjWXTF4wLLIQFRj9_7Fw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ytOkLG7ayRYZdSyIfVJ5EA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2tLxKh1OP1kVmXi0V013_w/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/petees-pie-company-new-york,petees-pie-company-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Bakeries,Coffee & Tea,Desserts,"A year later, and Petee's Pie is still damn delicious. Petee's was at the top of my list to re-visit on my short trip to the city, and bless the pie gods, I made it. I once again ordered their chocolate chess, and it was every bit of heaven I remembered. Ten days later from my visit (12/30/2017), and I'm still thinking about it. I was close to ordering a full pie to go, but against my better judgement, I didn't, and I regret it to this day. I fully recommend ordering a chess pie (their speciality) on your visit, and definitely consider taking one to-go for friends/family/loved ones, near and far. TL;DR: Life is short, eat Peete's chess pie! If you're craving good pie, go to petee's pie company! There's a reason it's so popular. Their pies are amazing.I got a key lime pie slice for $7 and it was the perfect blend of tangy and sweet. My friend got warm apple pie a la mode. The place is small, so it might be hard to find a place to sit and eat your pie. I ended up eating mine right on the counter, but that didn't take away from how delicious the pie was! The wild blueberry pie is amazzzzinnnnn.I went at the worst possible time (the day before Xmas) around 1pm, and they only had a few pies left for the day.  But I was lucky enough to get the last wild blueberry pie.  The whole pie is not cheap, but ok for a treat once in a while. I'm shocked I haven't left a review here yet because I come so often. This place absolutely rocks and is what I love most about some nyc restaurants, specialization. They don't have a gigantic menu of a million different things like some places and make what they're best at, pies, and certainly they deliver. Have had both the savory and sweet pies and they're both very fresh with great ingredients. A must if you're even remotely into pies. They are solid pies and the people behind the counter are very sweet, and the shop is extra quaint for it's LES location, but I just thought the pies were OK.I got a slice of apple, pumpkin, and sweet potato. And they were all fine enough, but they didn't blow me away. I've both homemade pies and store bought pies that were better. The apple pie in particular was more tart than I care for (but then I'm a fan of sweet apple pies). The price point is also high for what you get, 3 pieces cost me around $17. Ouch! It's a tiny shop with limited seating, plan to grab and go. My boyfriend and I came here late on a Sunday night. The pie shop is pretty small, but there were people ahead of us getting pie to go, and two other diners eating inside. We ordered the apple pie and got vanilla ice cream to go with it. The pie was served hot in a matter of minutes. It was delicious paired with the cold vanilla ice cream. We loved the flaky pastry and soft pieces of warm again contrasted with the vanilla ice cream. However, the pie itself wasn't the best. Nice to try once, but nothing amazing. The ambience here is wooden and simple. It's very small inside with limited seating, so probably best to get takeaway. Loved this place! I tried the key lime pie and the classic apple and both were amazing. Highly recommend having the apple warmed up with ice cream. The crust was so buttery and flakey. The place Is very small with limited seating so we had to stand to eat but that didn't bother me. Well worth the quick stop in, highly recommend! Petee's is a small mostly to-go pie shop in the middle of Brooklyn. I say mostly to-go as they have like 3-4 seats against a small counter.Ordered their famous chocolate chess pie. It can be described as a slightly undercooked brownie. And that's truly accurate, but for a pie, it's extremely dry and almost tasted flourless . The better variants of Chocolate chess pies are hybrids of chocolate chess , plus other flavors. Legendary 'Big Wayne' pie from Gus's famous fried chicken comes to mind. It's a cross between pecan pie and chocolate chess and has a more silky buttery flavor. Pie was too dry for my liking but is undeniably probably healthier. Very delicious pies and extra points for being open late. This is a perfect spot to take care of your sweet tooth after a dinner in East village. I had the coffee cream pie because chocolate and banana were out. Was very delicious. One star off for being a pretty expensive slice $7 for a very small slice. These aren't thick pies so the slice was small. Also very limited seating. Overall will be returning and trying their other flavors!RIP Diet. Dear God... Possibly the best Peach &amp; Banana Cream pie slices I have ever tasted. Sooo the many reviews here don't lie. The quality of these pies are phenomenal to say the least, all of my decadent sweets pies will be coming from Petee's for the holidays and just because life's better with a touch of sweetness anytime the mood calls for it. To elaborate...The Banana Cream pie is just as namesake says but not just any cream, I am talking about rich, fluffy, thick, melt in your mouth dreamy dairy creamy fresh with soft perfectly sweetened bananas, delicate and delightful so much so that you'd want to slather yourself with it and I guarantee your lover would love you even more! The Peach Pie is a mouth watering pleasure, each delightful bite was a taste of treasured goodness, succulent perfectly sweetened peaches and the butter rich crust baked perfectly. You just can't go wrong here. I ordered two small dairy dreamy creamy and lovely cups of their maple whip cream, talk about a delicate balance, this blew me away. The maple flavor is delightful to the taste buds tantalizingly sweet making the whip cream a total pleasure so much so that we ate this by itself never dolloping on the Peach slices as we intended. I Highly recommend everyone to go try a slice of your favorite pie 1st, guaranteed you'll be back for more, then order a whole pie online for a $5 discount. You can thank me later. Wow, how could I not have known about this place for so long?  Rather, I think I had a bookmark for a while but forgot to check and I immediately regret it.The warmed coconut custard was nice and went very well with a scoop of ice cream.  Albeit the slices are probably more expensive than the other desserts you find nearby I think this place is definitely worth it.  The two employees I met were great - friendly, helpful, and accommodating.  Unfortunately, I have a bad habit of forgetting new names almost immediately.The only downside is the seating availability is poor; there are only a few seats against the window and on a busy night they will most certainly be occupied.  But if you have the luck or patience to wait for a seat, it is absolutely worth your time to heat up a slice and slowly enjoy each soothing bite complemented with a cold touch of ice cream.Temporary Recommendation: Coconut custard pie a la mode Sooo I'll be honest - I'm not much of a pie person.  My dessert of choice is definitely of the ""anything chocolate""-variety and/or soft serve. So I don't really go out of my way to eat pie.  That being said, I was pleasantly surprised with our options at Peetee's Pie Company.  Being the chocolate fiend that I am, my fave was definitely the salted chocolate chess pie although to be fair - it tasted like a slightly undercooked brownie. The blueberry pie was also very tasty, but all of us agreed that it would have tasted so much better if it was warm.  We didn't ask them to heat it up so I'm not even sure if that was an option.   TIP: Ask them to heat up the pie and don't miss the homemade ice cream on top! I've been waiting to try this store for a while. I love key lime pie, but it's not a particularly easy find in NYC.  I'm biased towards the key lime pie version that has the traditional graham cracker crust with whipped cream.  Petee's version has the baked Alaskan marshmallow topping instead.  The crust is also different, almost a granola base offering some nuttiness to the taste.  The four star rating is not because the slice wasn't great, it's because it's not the version I love.  All in all, the overall flavor was good.  I would come back to get a key lime fix. I visit this adorable little place when we had some extra time to kill and we were in the area. I planned on simply peeking in because pies are really my go-to dessert. But everything smelled and looked so good I couldn't help myself! I went with an oatmeal cookie and a slice of black bottom chess pie. Both ended up being fine, but not quite sweet enough for my tastes. I guess pie places still aren't my thing. Pretty neat place on the Lower East Side. They specialize in pies and it's pretty damn good pies. There are so many different types of pies, that you can easily get overwhelmed. The guy behind the counter was pretty cool with helping you decide which slice to get. They had a seasonal slice which he said was great but alas, I'm obsessed with chocolate. So I went with the slice, that is his gf favorite. Definitely wasn't disappointed. It was a decedent slice. The whipped cream had a salty aftertaste which was a cool way to cut through the sweet flavor of the chocolate. $7 a slice is pretty hefty, especially when the slices are tiny as well. But spot on flavor. Definitely worth visiting. Tiny little pie shop on the lower east side with a good selection of pies. You can order by the slice and sit at the small stools by the window and get coffee &amp; tea too. Flavors change quite a bit, but you can't go wrong! Remarkable rotating menu is something to look forward to. Small place with very limited seating so best to just pick up a pie and enjoy at home. Pies are glorious! Crust is simple, buttery and flaky.  Fillings are not too sweet and there are some interesting flavors. Mmmmm!  You can order little individual sized pies.  They have several traditional, seasonal, savory &amp; ice box pies to enjoy. I've tried the Apple Pie, Peach, Sour Cherry and Blueberry but my favorites are the Banana Cream Pie and Lemon Meringue. Top it off with some ice cream or whip cream and get one step closer to dessert heaven! I was craving some wild maine blueberry pie and since I couldn't visit this year, I found petee's. We also got the banana cream pie which was so delicious!!! Cant wait to try their chess pies...which apparently is like a custard pie but more firm in texture.Just go. We went right when it opened and already 2 people came in right after me. Pie is usually not my top choice of dessert to get but today I wanted to try something new.  I have walked by this place so many times and today I finally stepped in and I'm so glad that I did.  The aroma of the fresh pies when you step foot into the door is amazing.  It just makes me want to try everything, but we controlled ourselves and only ordered two slices, the peach blueberry and the brown butter honey pecan pies.  The peach blueberry is a seasonal flavor recommended by the staff.  Its definitely flavorful but personally I think the blueberries overpowers the peach.  You can only taste a hint of the peaches.  The crust was also really flaky and before we took a bite, the pie was falling apart already.  This would have tasted a lot better if it was warm and if it had some ice cream with it.  The brown butter honey pecan was definitely my favorite of the two.  The sweetness level and the texture was great.  The filling's texture is almost like jello and it just melts into your mouth and it goes well with the crunch of the pecan and the crust.  Definitely want to come here to get this for thanksgiving. I placed an online order for some Thanksgiving Day pies. I received an email the day before giving me instructions to the tee on pickup guidelines and best practices which I found super helpful. I arrived on time. My pies were packed and ready. I was offered homemade maple whipped cream as an accoutrements to my pies. I would've purchased it if I hadn't already spent $95 on pies I'd never tasted. Another $7 was out of the question. The pies are soooooo gooood. You know how sometimes apple pie can be undercooked in the middle? Even if you reheat it, it isn't the texture you want it to be? The harvest apple is nothing like it. It's smooth and the perfect consistency straight through. The apples aren't too mushy or too crisp. I'm a fan of sour cherry and Petee's doesn't disappoint. The crust on both pies are buttery, but each crust is different. I'll definitely be back. If you walk in to any party with one of these, you'll be getting compliments on your contribution by all who partake because these confections are truly impressive. We had a hard time spotting this place. Actually passed it up! Needs some better signage or lighting. I will say the aroma when you walked in, was heavenly! It's a really tiny place, but has many pies! We took a few home for the family! I had the coconut custard that was really delicious! We ordered banana cream pies (slices) and salted chocolate chess pie. Tried the pecan pie as well! Very good! The girls in there, were supper nice and friendly.",https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7dbtLXaLt9kpoqNam-NpKg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/U0OMqP6Il1hk46ODXpDkLA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MZ4SzovMxWHSaCHCawiSYA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kFqzUk4BUahU5CuGr5YCng/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/h4psQzVD-FLLsx6C3jxavg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6JYUcDqJggHuhmP1VIAS4g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jnv3pOB16RElWJ6qX-CGxg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YyShJ7xiZXHgxSxWm8mhAQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/s7-nPjG1zrBB-wln303mkA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8_PIOZ9CZroekwJ_iILJZA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-JxNc095girHh8lznfjyYQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0YkXhcfpFHuYw_33Iq9kgQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/awfgjA1sib9hhFFz17xhYg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oG4qVJvKoXnH-xZlzR84Kw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FawbNpYZKCaZlEirC1mu6g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0an-_ToPUjtVXoVWqW8vyQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/d6wZKEJ8-YEx0zOvXUPSNQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LH3dXMU-8Y7uOECpSliwZA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Cy4T4sSxKDxGUrs9VDJpHg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LR9dIrDslUMOxhXAOX12RA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CkP-o-pZ_DM7_UBC9tJyGg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/N0wK_CoQMNY8Jt3XN-sJwQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xF0rzve9WVSP-5sz7i9JOw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qJndmvSoQk-4i1yrhsRHgg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3sKunQXP42SYwc5IaAn_Ow/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MV7ZW3Qlh8jokjgKBFpscA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/i0vwqhf_fXAnO6kuRWl6Yw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DssV88qV0KDV9-Ac1GMaWQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xZiFeaqr7nWoH5IYBJBkVg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Wt9or9rz5N42pifZjsgsRg/258s.jpg
https://www.yelp.com//biz/pho-grand-new-york-2,pho-grand-new-york-2,New York,10002,NY,Vietnamese,NA,NA,"I went here by myself on the New Year's Day because I was craving pho and had nothing else to do. Despite many restaurants being closed on New Year's Day, I was happy to find out Pho Grand remained open. I liked how Pho Grand offered many meat options. It's cool that they offer even the organ meats, but if you don't like them, be careful when you're ordering. Make sure to look up the names of the parts so you don't end up with something that you don't want to eat. One of my favorite place to get pho in the city. convenient location, close by grand st subway station.Beef is fresh, broth is good. Definitely recommended when you in the area. Two stars for the food. Nothing special that would top other Pho spots but not bad at all. Service receives zero stars if allowed! Came here on a Saturday around 7pm because 99 hot pot had a 3 hour wait, I should've waited. Entering the place was pretty dead besides possibly 3 other tables. Party of 2 seated by ourselves. Was quickly thrown menus right as we sat down. Ordered a small pho, spring rolls and a chicken patty rice dish. My friends rice dish came out the same time as the spring rolls. I've finished my share of spring rolls and my friend is already 75% done with her meal, then my pho comes. From the moment I received my pho, the waiter hovers from a table away. The whole time I'm eating I feel someone staring a hole through my head. Not the feeling you would want while shoving food at your face. Not a mere second after my friend finishes her food, the waiter rushes over to scoop up the plate. Same happened when my friend picks up the last piece of spring roll and rudely asks if she still needed the fish sauce... well damn! can't a girl have sauce for her spring roll?!? Same after I was done with my pho. Wasn't even in the restaurant for more than 25 mins... was tossed the bill like they really needed us out. There is another Vietnamese restaurant down the block take your business there if you aren't trying to beat someone in a food race. Decent spot for pho. Typical no-frills decor, but more attractive than I was expecting. Maybe a quarter full at 6:30 on a Sunday.I went with the #9 small pho, with eye round beef and brisket. I got my toppings within a few minutes and my pho within five. Service in general was very responsive.A lighter, aromatic broth, with a healthy portion of beef and lots of noodles. The eye round beef was pretty good; the brisket was subpar. The noodles were fine, though I spotted a few strands with different widths-- what's up with that? One note is that the toppings are just bean sprouts, thai basil, and lemon-- no jalapeno, cilantro, or lime. They do have all the standard sauces though.My pho was around $7, or a ten dollar bill to cover tax and tip. This won't be the best Vietnamese you've ever had, but I found the price to be fair and the experience quick. Going to give them 4 stars for being nice even though the food is more like 3 stars. I splashed myself with some sauce and one of the waiters quickly appeared with a small bowl of soapy warm water. Anyway, I digress...I came in alone and ordered like a fat kid on death row or Pete Wells on a research trip. I raised some eyebrows but they still humored me.Banh cuon (steamed rice rolls with ground pork)was disappointing because there was so little actual filling inside the rice crepe and the crepe texture was bumpy and dry instead of smooth and chewy. Cha gio (crispy spring rolls) were whatever too. Pho Tai was tasty but the noodles could have been springier. My fave dish was the sauted water spinach. At least they take credit cards here. Clean, soothing broth and tasty noodles, that's what I look for in pho. This relatively larger pho restaurant offers a variety of Chinese food items along with pho. And yes, they take card. Thank god, since most Chinese restaurants don't. It's a get-it-yourself type of restaurant, meaning you get your own spoon and chopsticks at your table. It's a nice change from having to constantly ask for utensils or napkins. It's convenient. Most importantly this place is not overpriced and super affordable! Great place for pho and shrimps with the head! Food was average. Not great but not awful; but the waiter insisted on kicked us out even when we weren't  ready to leave! How rude. I almost didn't even want to tip them. And can I mention this place is full of non Asians which to me raises a flag. Tourist trap much? I mean maybe this restaurant is the reject of waiting two hours for 99 favor hot pot next door, cause that was my friend and I'd first choice. I'm gonna have to pass on this place since the customer service wasn't remotely up to par and there are plenty of Vietnamese restaurants in Chinatown. I come here for the Pho, which is awesome. Great for a winters eve. A huge bowl of Pho (a plethora of basil and bean sprouts on the side), a beer, and an order of summer rolls (2) = $20 Maybe I should have ordered pho.But I ordered summer rolls and bun cha.  Both were incredibly bland and in no way reminded me of Vietnam.I'd go back to try the pho, just go give them the benefit of the doubt, but so far, no good. Pho Grand is conveniently next to the D subway exit  so it is easy to pop in for a fresh Vietnamese meal.  The shrimp  was incredibly fresh.  No surprise with a fish market next door.  We tried the Spring rolls and were pleasantly surprised with pork spring rolls .I opted for my soup to be chicken broth with shrimp and rice noodle.  Lovedit Always able to accommodate large parties which is what I love about this place. Pho and other foods comes out at lightning speed and delicious. It's sanitary, delicious, and always great. Love coming here for any and all meals! My sentiments towards Vietnamese food in NYC is tepid at best. Perhaps the standards of this reviewer are exceedingly harsh, but my eyes have seen the light, and these lips hath tasted what good soup ought to taste like. So what's the deal with this place? Well, they give lemons with your pho... so that's an automatic one star deduction. I don't care if lemons are the cheaper citrus, give me my damn limes... if you did, perhaps this spot would be up a star in this review.Due to the phenomenon of cultural appropriation (see Taylor Akin of ""Stock"" fame spew his nonsense in the instruction of the consumption of pho)... pho prices nationwide are rising at astronomical rates. If you could buy ""stock"" in pho, from a retrospective standpoint, it would have been a good investment to buy lotsa stock 5-10 years back (you'd be rich by now). And this spot has fallen victim to the pho price increases (as if NYC food prices weren't high enough as it is).What is considered a small or medium (in less generous jurisdiction) elsewhere is what a larger bowl of pho here will be. At least the broth is quite flavorful and the noodles aren't falling apart in the soup; they've been consistently served al dente and right in the friendly medium area as far as not sticking together too much and not being too separated.You could certainly do a worse job acquiring pho in the city (Pho Pasteur... blech). At least the standard pho here doesn't come with those rubber ""meat"" balls... but they could be a tad more generous with the beef distribution. Disgusting! Just found a hair in the food! The waiter even refused to acknowledge it is from their staff! Disgusting as hell. Tell your chef to wrap hair up before cook food! my favorite pho place in chinatown. I love their crispy spring rolls! service is very fast. two thumbs up! I ordered the no. 1 big bowl of pho. I have to say that this place is pretty good compared to the other place I tried here in Manhattan. The broth is nice and beefy, not too salty, and the noodles had a good texture. The price is great and you get a decent portion enough to fill you up. I would definitely recommend this place and would come back. Was not particularly impressed by my experience here. Although to be fair, I can't speak to the pho. I got:Spring roll (rice paper roll) - The version here has too much vermicelli filling in my opinion. If you looked at a cross section of the roll in the middle, it looks almost entirely of vermicelli with a tiny bit of lettuce on the edge. The peanut sauce is a great though, and covers up the overwhelming use of vermicelli. And the wrap was good, not too gummy or hard. Just wished they put better stuff inside the wrap.Pork vermicelli bowl - The version here was disappointing. Some of the grilled pork was sliced too thinly so after it got cooked it was too dry and hard. And the best pieces were fine but not stellar (the way some other versions I've had have been). Would also have liked to have more pickled veggies / other stuff (and less vermicelli). I heard from my friend that this was a pretty decent pho place in NYC. Coming from California and especially from San Jose, where Vietnamese dishes reign supreme, I already had high expectations for the bowl of pho that I was going to get from here. I was surprised at how affordable the bowls were compared to all the other expensive food places there are in NYC, so that was a plus for me. Unfortunately they didn't have my all time favorite bun bo hue, but not all Vietnamese restaurants have that. I got a normal bowl of pho instead and it was actually pretty delicious! My pet peeve was that there was a big sign near the register saying that this was one of the top 100 Chinese restaurants... which is strange since ""Pho"" is in the name of this place. Also, our waiter was also Chinese. This is likely a Vietnamese-Chinese fusion restaurant though, which did catch me off guard. The food was not enjoyable. I got the shrimp ""pho"" which basically was just shrimp and veggie soup. Super basic, nothing special. The vegetable dumplings were gross, don't get them. The veggie rolls were the o my thing I really liked but they were so small there wasn't much filling in them. I would recommend finding somewhere else to go if your looking for authentic pho, this isn't your spot. We were told upon asking that ""everything has msg in it"", by our very brash waiter o_OThe upsides?The food was cheapish and the dishes were humongous ($10 for a large saute chicken and vegetables that came drowned in some type of sweet sauce that wasn't mentioned on the menu and made what I thought was going to be a low calorie dish decidely not).Our party of 8 had no problem getting seated walking in without a reservation on a sunday nightWe were not rushed and we got a lot of entertainment from our waiters bizarre actionsThe downsidesObvious town our waiter was not the conventional polite server you would expect. Everything we asked for seemed to be a hassle for him and he got our orders wrongThe msg, duhThe food wasn't anything to write home aboutDon't ask the waiter to take a picture for you. Somehow it will come out really lean and horrible lookingThe atmosphere / decor reminded me of a cafeteria instead of a restaurant Average Vietnamese fare. Pho came out quickly but the rice noodles were overcooked and the beef cuts and soup were nothing to write home about. They also seemed very eager to snatch away your food the minute you take your utensils away from it, trying to rush you out especially on busy days. The restaurant is kind of ill designed that if you're within a meter or two of the door you're bound to get blasted with cold air in the winter despite their draft door.",https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JQgPi8ZpeBHP26ECzuxaJg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/byOrzwSyDqQ_9wAw1GD8DA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wn2EjWiCZcJFHgtKdT4USA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PiwKcj1oPYErcYtiDflbvQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/De54o8tInCjAmwtFguMZeQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/weDcuhPzYnIMEtMGusKnvA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/aDBIOPTsW2Q023njSLEpNA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ardEwbCoAiRlxBfuagjgeA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6zc4uADYDSdjmgQkf83FvA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_ROY10zrwb48Nb_3ZNtRTg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/d0oP58M2q5cc0e8DhSs0Ew/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-_3qkqB7sjLejoFStNl4AQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AcUJboqBpKqYN63CjxsBYw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KOyLik8Xs9XG8Iri6INnlw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XMaaKmEgZyqZYr41n9Zp6g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/x3AkOuU70Ns35eLKg8lkmQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xuiYOHM-Tip2cGQkNt2avQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/B3GbLZ63nxs39LWdqpxtiQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EH5lHpKgjgHOut1rfO2iiA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Gi53djRjtdIDxsIiyeNKuA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BRlDxh0U7yIkFcjlpyLy9Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zmVFrv9EgqhbecIffDYK9A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xnr3VRKv7C10hzbbG2COhw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DbTsNX9J1rkH3QCTqXiEhQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9UAjDzvFEQpYtI_nRJ15fg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kdsC0VpJClqrRCuK3P__yg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/G1ZXkkfGvX3nUQkGDCJQMQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UapBMKofUD6rhjkEMRUnCg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xOZi_sQwbcwZB_Iyg66GTg/258s.jpg,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/piacere-new-york,piacere-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Pizza,Italian,NA,"My first time at Piacere was excellent! One of the best Italian meals I've had in NYC! Loved everything about our experience at Piacere! The restaurant feels inimate and cozy with the wood burning pizza oven in the back. The servers are very friendly. The arugula pear salad was a perfect appetizer! It had light dressing and tasted fresh. Loved the complimentary fresh focaccia and white bread with olive oil. All of their specials sounded amazing, but I went with the cannelloni. The cannelloni was absolutely amazing! The rigatoni with bacon and red sauce was also very very good! For dessert, the tiramisu was heavenly! It was full of flavor and was creamy. This place is outstanding! I look forward to my next visit! Side note: **ITS CASH AND AMEX ONLY!** Came here with a large group on a Sunday night. It has a rusty decor. The service was good. The wine and drink selection was a bit sparse. For food: - pappardelle with wild boar: best dish of the night. The pasta was done well and the boar wasn't too gamey. - seafood pasta: the clams wasn't fresh and taste a bit rotten. Don't order this  - sausage and mushroom pizza: tomato sauce was lacking but the crust was nice. It makes a nice snack or appetizer, but definitely not as a main course.  Tldr; mediocre food and drink. It's a nice place for a large group -- long tables, loud and decent service. I visited Piacere on Christmas weekend for a pretty late dinner. We were hungry, cold, and ready to eat. We had a reservation but it wasn't too busy. The restaurant atmosphere was a bit more casual than I thought. I was craving something really creamy and cheesy but the waiter said they don't make any pastas with a cream base, which is find. One of the few specials he offered that was not on the regular menu was carbonara pasta. So we ordered the carbonara and a pizza (Salsiccia Fung) with two beers. They mixed up our order and brought out the wrong pasta at first. We shared the pizza and finished it among the two of us before the pasta came out because it wasn't that big.The carbonara came out but the portion was pretty small too. So we ordered another pasta (truffle mushroom pasta). The carbonara had a ton of bacon! The truffle pasta I was a bit more disappointed with. Both dishes were not bad but not what we had expected it to be.Also, we got our bill and found out that Carbonara is $21.95??? We didn't know this when we ordered because it wasn't listed on the menu. I estimated it to be much cheaper because their other pastas, including seafood pasta, ranged from $16-20ish. Considering that all it takes for a carbonara is some eggs, pasta, cheese, and bacon I was shocked it was priced higher than their seafood loaded pasta. Also, please be aware that they INCLUDE gratuity on their bill (Which the owner says was a mistake on the waiters below..? - is this not more problematic?) We didn't catch this until later and ended up tipping twice. We spent a total of $140 for two people.. I don't mind paying the money for good food/experience but I'm unsure the experience I had was worth that much. They also only accept cash or American Express and have an ATM in the restroom. To be honest, didn't really enjoy my meal here. Everything seemed maybe 10-20% overpriced for what we were getting, and some of the dishes just weren't that good. I came with a group of 5 people and we ordered dishes family style b/c we wanted to try a lot of stuff, but some of the pasta dishes took SO long to come out and the portions were quite small. Highlights: - Parpadelle with wild boar ragu: This was actually amazing; perfectly cooked pasta in a delicious ragu sauce. It also came out almost instantly after we ordered it. - Seafood pasta: This was some kind of special. It came with tons of seafood and the tomato sauce it came in was really nicely seasoned. - Gnocchi: I'm not a huge gnocchi person but the other people at the table really liked it. It was extremely soft and the basil pesto sauce it came in was pretty good too. Lowlights: - Tomato bruschetta: Extremely overpriced and very meh. It was something like $8 for two pieces of grilled bread, tomatoes, and olive oil. Barely tasted like it had any salt or any other flavors. - Linguine w/ clams: All I could taste was olive oil. It didn't have any of the typical seafood/clam flavor that this pasta usually comes with. - Truffle/mushroom pasta: I forget the actual name of this pasta but it's the only one of the menu of this type. I recommend skipping it. It's pricey b/c of the truffles but there really isn't that much truffle flavor (or mushroom flavor, for that matter). It was just salty. Overall, I'd pick a different Italian restaurant in the area (there are so many!) over Piacere. We had dinner here on Christmas Day. Great little restaurant with good service and even better food. We tried a pizza and the boar pasta. Both were excellent. Came here on a Tuesday night. I did not have any issue getting seats but it was really hot inside the restaurant. Portion size was medium and the food was good. Reasonably priced. God this place is good. It's the one place we look forward to visiting most when we're in town to see family. The products are fresh, homemade, delicious. Awesome wine selection. You absolutely need to try their pizzas! And the service is great -- definitely feels like you're dining in a place where the owners care about giving you a great experience. Located in between Chinatown and Little Italy, Piacere is open very late, as in all the way until 2AM. Its primarily a wine bar, but they also serve really good Italian food. For my first pasta, I ordered the Taglierini porcini e tartufo. Its basically a Linguine-like pasta served with fragrant mushrooms and truffles in a olive oil and garlic sauce. This was so RICH in flavor!! I was amazed at just how much the mushrooms and truffles really added to the pasta.I was ravenous tonite, so I ordered a second pasta. I went with my favorite dish, the Linguine Vongole. Another superb job here as well, the clams were plentiful and had this nice, almost sweet and savory seafood like aroma to them. I also had a grapefruit soda. The soda left a sparkling water sensation :) Our last night in NYC, we wanted pizza and pasta but did not want a touristy spot in Little Italy. It was early, 6:45 on a Saturday night, so we got lucky and there was no wait. The place had a cool, laid back vibe and the staff was extremely friendly and welcoming.My husband and I had red wine the server recommended and our kids 5 and 8 ordered sodas, all they have are organic sodas so they both picked the ginger ale. It tasted more like ginger beer but it was good. We started with the beef carpaccio, it was very fresh and had a great flavor, my 8 year old daughter wanted a second order. We also ordered Quattro Formaggio and Margherita pizzas, a Rigatoni Special with onion and bacon red sauce, and linguini with butter. The Quattro Formaggio pizza was awesome, it's served with a spicy olive oil on the side that adds just a little kick. The Margherita was good but there was hardly any basil on it. Both pasta dishes were great, the noodles cooked perfectly al dente. The rigatoni special had a rich flavor, even the plain buttered linguini tasted fantastic! My only issue with the rigatoni was that the bacon pieces were not small and they were pretty much all chewy fat. It added wonderful flavor to the dish but I couldn't eat them. We were too full for dessert, we had to take half of the Margherita pizza with us. There are tables out front and the front windows slide open so it feels almost like one continuous space. The bathroom is cool, my favorite part was the mannequin legs tp holders. If you want fantastic Italian food without the over-the-top cheesiness of Little Italy, eat here. Great little Italian place; great food, helpful friendly staff and good for birthday parties! We had a large good there for a birthday and the team were very accommodating, helpful and with prompt service. I would defo recommend going for their starter platters and sharing! EEEExcelent pizza! WOW! Perfect thin crust. I had the San Danielle and my husband had the Calabrese. Both just perfect. The environment is cozy, but it's half bar, half restaurant.....and you can feel that. Not necessarily bad or good, just noting that it feels a little like a bar. The wine list could use some improvement tho. The bottle list was ok, but a little expensive, and there wasn't much of a selection for glasses. It was ok, but not amazing. Service was spot on tho. Overall a great little Italian place! :) Very tasty pizza.However, they didn't take anything except cash or American Express cards. Portion for pasta is pretty small. Also, bread was never served to us. Excellent. Dine al fresco or inside which is intimate (not so much by NYC standards). Beautiful wood fired pizza oven. Very friendly, accommodating service. Not fancy but slightly rustic, exposed brick, warm, longer communal tables, low lighting, classic Italian background music. The food however, is excellent. Nice wine list. Limited beer selection that could use a little revisit.We ordered a variety of appetizers. The Burrata w spec salad was exceptional, definitely not average. The smoked mozzarella w nice char, perfect balance of smoke, served w spec was delicious. The mixed salad with avocado was lightly dressed, ultra fresh, nice portion. Grilled octopus w potatoes was perfectly cooked, fork tender, nicely seasoned. But the real shining star was the wild boar porchini mushroom parpadelle. Which is sheer perfection, ultra rich.Craving to go back as they offer many things we wanted to try but were quite full, like the spaghetti w bottarga, chili &amp; lemon, wild red snapper in banana leaf, and of course the wood fired pizza.If you crave authentic regional Italian dishes, not Americanized touristy Italian, then this is a must. *Very dark, strange quirky restroom. I stopped into Piacere on a really chilly night and was warmly welcomed into this adorable restaurant. I loved the decor, very welcoming with the brick oven in the back and I especially loved that you could smell the fresh herbs! ALSO everyone was Italian, not Brooklyn-Italian but real Italian! To start they had a good wine list (and reasonably pricedl). I had the pizza with peppers and onions which was really delicious, it was a very thin crust and you can tell all ingredients were fresh. I also had the broccoli rabe which had great flavor. My two notes are that the brocolli rabe had a lot of stems in it and probably could have cooked a touch longer and parts of my crust were a little burnt (but that didn't affect the flavor, just was a weird feeling in my mouth). I definitely would recommend it! Phenomenal little place. Cozy, comfortable family sitting. Food is absolutely wonderful. A lot of flavors. You leave feeling light and not heavy. My friend and I had pasta dishes - homemade pappardelle with wild boar ragu and house gnocchi with pesto. We had their special appetizer - calamari in a marinara sauce. Delicious!!! Went here for dinner lastnight. We had the Carbonara Pizza and the Margherita Pizza! Both pizzas were yummy with a perfect crust! They also had a Moretti Rossa on tap that was really flavorful. No wait for a table and our waiter was really genuine. Will definitely be back! Smaller Italian joint on the outskirts of Little Italy, they tend to be busy!  I really liked the rustic interior of the resto, nice bar &amp; wood burning oven in back.. great date place.  Smallish beer list &amp; larger wine, it seems to be family owned.  The menu is nice they have like a dozen pizzas, great appetizer list, many pastas as well as some secondi, salads &amp; meat/cheese plates etc.  Tried the taglierini wild boar ragu and it was exceptional...Give it a shot  PS- Cash &amp; AMEX Only! Rip off &amp; avoid at all cost. Went with a group of 6. Service was awful, forgot to bring wine and we finally canceled, we had to ask for bread wth our food. Half the table received their meal, while the other half waited 15 mins. Over- priced meal. There are so many other good places nearby like Sauce.  And the music was terrible. No idea how this place has good reviews, it's a tourist trap with meh food. This is the best pizza place in town. The owners are super friendly &amp; hospitable. This is a great place to come when it is freezing cold out. It was Christmastime and we were in Little Italy. As if that right there wasn't enough to make the night super magical, we decided to stop by this cozy, adorable little spot on Broome for a delicious pickup to warm us up. It was perfect! It was my first time ordering takeout via Eat24 right from the Yelp app. The whole process was super simple. The order was ready and waiting when promised and everything was piping hot and packaged securely. We split the gnocchi pomodoro and tomato pie. Oh deliciousness!!! We didn't make it out of this section of town before we scarfed it all down. So, so yummy! The place was so sweet and cozy. It had an underground feel to it. Dark at night with candles, rustic tables, exposed brick walls all which can be seen from the street through the floor to ceiling Windows. It was louder but not in a bad way. It was in a ""this is a really great, fun atmosphere"" way with wine glasses clanking and people laughing. It definitely made me want to return and actually dine inside next time. Good vibes. Oh, and they have outdoor seating as well in warmer weather.  The man handling the order which I picked up near the gorgeous wood burning stove, just past the inviting bar was very sweet and welcoming. Cash only except for Amex which I think is strange. Parking is what you expect. Luckily we were able to just double park and run in. I'm sure it's not a problem for most patrons as no one drive here, but we had our car on this particular trip to NYC",https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oXj0kNvnYFrl5YX1GAlHfQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kt9M0ON37_2izvWAVt1KCw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EJ4M8CM7FUvsUx23M8eguw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/i5jUMUARCIiRcoOPFBVHdg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oxsPhTnZ7Z6yg-AcNK0lpA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EsCfa5W-jaXfx8tiT1-w1Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/f4TYLyd3OnzJf6PjG7m30w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bhyDZKouzy_VIRhVFvGwqw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AGxq24A1WTXvXXTqvdm5zw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/64A3rSOq662pHNt_H0FEOQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1g8GLOH3w6bQsM7F7vxSsg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6V7x_CIc-OICE2pwj_eMFA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CsEzXcgXhdflOnoRAl6TRQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/q7--ZfngGSFHruagR1TdUQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/g2A7RsMLDRkYE6nO33Q2JA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bzvk89MxJRc-NcTNGbgPRA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HqFPH4hc7KjlUQhVANbOug/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AM-GqB2MkX92CDifh8msIg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4TF_9QDy7Gs6Q4iZJJ5PgA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/b2OUnp7mkeLeF-ZkrzLrpA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/r9r_1DqaB6YIu1OX4Tex9Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/to-hJuuhq9VWbas6dK5LBg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ecth9-x4Xa552qN0q3GtRw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/N-K7lShRmOwzat-hbW1d9w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2B-qzva1ntvxJqIQN0fjvA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FFiRFBLya2cZCQ3yTPJJBQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tIS7wY3M7XcrD8oZKFkG-Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/sL1zWGUuLX-GZQZqmZbnyQ/258s.jpg,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/pig-and-khao-new-york,pig-and-khao-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Filipino,Thai,Asian Fusion,"I came for brunch - the food was amazing, but it took 40+ minutes for food to arrive, and when it did, it was served separately. Had to wait an extra 20 minutes for the second entree to come. I came for the brunch and while it was pricey, the khao soi was excellent. Only suggestion I have is to prepare the food in a way so it's hot and fresh at the same time as everything else, so no one has to feel awkward when some people have food and some don't. As a tip, you do have to remind the staff a few times you're still waiting for food. Came here for my birthday. We were seated on time for our party of 8. This restaurant has plenty of space for big parties so that's a plus. Service was not the greatest however. Didn't check up on us much and the food wasn't served all at once. Sisig took another 20 minutes after all the other dishes were served so we didn't eat till it came.Quality of the food was overall satisfying. However, a side of longanisa was basically 2 pieces cut in half at $3 an order. It tasted more like nam rather than traditional longanisa. It had more of a sour/pickled taste rather than the usual sweet or spicy flavor. Sisig was right on. Savory and texture was done right. Papaya salad is different from the traditional style but in a good way. The taro was a great addition. Best meal was probably the jowl which was a great balance between sweet, savory and spicy. Steak and eggs was cooked perfectly and the sauce elevated the dish. Drinks were strong and mediocre on quality. It's been almost two months since I came here, so my review may be a bit hazy...but from what I remember I didn't leave this place feeling that full nor satisfied. It's a unique kick to Thai/Filipino cuisine, but I don't really see the hype. The portions were smaller than expected and although the flavor isn't something I experience regularly, I would have liked a little more 'sustenance' to it.Three of us shared the grilled pineapple salad (very sweet but didn't have more than 3 shrimps in it), the sizzling sisig (flavorful at first but got tiring), and a rice dish that I now can't recall. Otherwise, service was great and the dimly lit vibe is chill for a girl's night out! The 3 of us were here for a Bottomless Saturday brunch. We had made reservations for 11 and when we arrived the place was quite empty with only 3 tables occupied by other parties. The place started filling up close to noon.For Bottomless, you get an option of Mimosas (Lychee, Orange, Mango or White Peach) or Self Pour Beer (Narragansett was on draft). We decided to go with Mimosas and in the 2 hour duration, smashed 3 pitchers of Lychee, Mango and White Peach flavors, all good. Needless to say, the champagne is probably cheap quality because all of us were hungover the next day!Food is amazing at this place and we tried Grilled Pork Jowl, Khao Soi and Chili Pan Mee, all absolutely amazing... Khao Soi being the winner though!Service is absolutely amazing and they pay close attention to how you behave, so if they get a sense that you are borderline wasted, they'll take away booze from your table.They only have 1 restroom, which was the only inconvenience at this place. Overall, a very nice brunch experience. Came here on a Friday night. if you want to skip the long wait, it's always good to make a reservation because it's really popular. Pig and Khao is definitely one of my favorite Thai restaurant in NYC. Their food has never disappointed me. We ordered sizzling sisig and chili pan Mee this time. Sizzling sisig is a Filipino dish that made from parts of pig head and liver, seasoned with chilli peppers. The sizzling sisig at pig and Khao will cook the raw eggs with the pig head for you when your food is on the table. My bf said he has tried sizzling sisig at four different restaurants in New york, and the one at pig and Khao is his favorite so far. In the chili pan Mee, there were ground pork, ramen noodles, crispy anchovies, and slow poached eggs. It was very flavourful. The only downside of the dinner that night was the service. When we were ready to order. We had to sit there for about 10 mins with no service. I understand it was busy on a Friday, but the staff should be more considerate and better trained . It is never a good dining experience for anyone who has to wait for too long to get service. Came here on a Sunday night at 6pm no wait.Ordered the Lower East Side drink and the San Miguel Beer. Lower East side was definitely not my drink- would not get that again.Khao Soi- I'm a big fan of curry and having tried this dish in Thailand I was impressed. Served with dry/wet noodles, the crunchiness of the dry noodles when mixed in with the soup gives it another texture. Make sure to use the lime will make a difference in the soup!!Pork Belly Adobo- the pork belly was a little too crispy for my liking, my first bite felt like I bit into rock but the bigger pieces were a tad better. The poached egg and soy sauce/vinegar definitely complemented the dish well. The egg and sauce helped soften the crunchy texture of the meat and the vinegar cut out the over saltiness that soy sauce can be. Overall, can be a little pricey for the small plates but the music and atmosphere made up for it, will be back! I have had Pig and Khao multiple times, but the last time I went it was just disappointing.  I usually go on the weekends for dinner, but this time I went on a weekday.  There was no wait, but the food was not as good as I remember it.  My favorite coconut rice was bland, and I barely tasted the coconut in the rice.  Usually, I would finish the whole bowl. It's nice and sweet and different from any other coconut rice I have tried, but that night it tasted like every other coconut rice and nothing special.  Same for the short ribs and the sisig. It was not up to their regular standards.  The piece of short ribs I had was so dry I felt like I could barely swallow it. The way I remember the short ribs is that it is usually moist and tender and falls right off the bones.  As far as the sisig, it was over cooked, and it was burnt and crunchy.  I don't know what was going on that night, but it definitely wasn't the same.  I hope they were just having a down day because I would hate to lose a good place to eat. First of all, I'm really sad that we missed the pad Thai pancake as they've stopped making them, but that's okay as the food here was still bomb. This is known as a Asian fusion restaurant between Thai and Filipino, but it really is primarily Filipino. My Filipino friend during the dinner said that everything was traditional Filipino food and quite authentic (besides the papaya salad that is).We ordered the Khao Soi ($16), Sizzling Sisig ($15), Green Papaya Salad ($14), and Halo-Halo ($8). All were quite good; however my highlight was the Khao Soi. Red curry and fried egg noodles is a great combination I haven't had before and my friend practically licked the bowl clean it was so good. Special mention to the halo-halo for dessert though, an interesting twist on Taiwanese shaved ice for me with flan, crispy rice, coconut, and ice cream mixed in.Meal Value (from 1-10, my measure of quantity/quality of the meal compared to price): 8.5Great portions for the price and everything was delicious. I would highly recommend others to come here and try Filipino food, especially if you've never had it before. A friend of mine loves this place for dinner. In need of a girls brunch, we decided to check out the scene. I've never had dinner at Pig and Khao but apparently it's always packed. Brunch was much more tame.The menu isn't huge, but what they offer is very good. I had the corned beef hash and it was delicious. With brunch I always feel so stuffed to the point it's gross, and here the portions are actually a normal size so I didn't feel like I hated myself after. The food is very fresh and the service is pretty good, would love to try it for a southeast Asian dinner. The first thing you experience when you walk in is the amazing smell of filipino food being cooked. The aroma really overwhelms the senses. I had a seat at the bar and was able to watch the magic and chaos happen. If you try anything at all, get the sizzling Sisig and khao soi with coconut rice, it is a flavor bomb that you will not regret. The savory rich flavors had me shedding a single happy tear. On the flip side, I wasn't wowed by the octopus nor the prawns. They were good but very average in presentation and flavor for the price so I would recommend skipping that. The drinks menu is delicious and pairs well with the asian fusion menu. This restaurant has been on our list for quite some time and we are finally able to try it out. We ordered the sizzling sisig the pork jowl and the khao mio. Everything was so flavorful and delicious. This place has one of the best sisigs i have ever had. We also shared the halo halo which is so good and definitely enough for two people. We shared our dishes with four people so it was more than enough. The drinks were very good too. The staff was very friendly and very informative of everything. They were able to help us make our decisions for drinks and food. I'd come back again. Prime location, excellent food and service, but terribly long wait times, though it's worth it. The food was very authentic and absolutely delicious,  the drinks were good and the staff was helpful with the recommendations. I was particularly a fan of the friend chicken wings special. They were spicy, but had  a balanced  sweetness and crunch; absolutely delicious. The papaya salad was refreshing and crisp, and the Khao soy was so rich in flavor and filling. I typically dislike coconut, but their coconut white rice was perfect. Everything is shared family style and wait staff is very nice. There is a front area with the open kitchen and   a back room of close quarter tables. This place is perfect for a group or just a couple of people. The prices were not outrageous and the portions were generous. I highly recommend going there for Thai food. Overall 3.5 . Service was 5 star but unfortunately the food was less than stellar (3). Our reservation was made weeks prior for 6pm but they forgot they had a buy out until 7pm. Management was kind enough to hook us up with our first round of drinks, lumpia, and a dessert and overall just made sure we were taken care of which was very much appreciated. We ordered:Malaysian prawns- my fave of the dishes. The sweetness of the fried coconut complimented the savory prawns.Pineapple salad- a little spicy however the pineapple was the perfect balance for the spice it had.Pork adobo w poached eggs- too salty and too much soy sauce. The pork belly was dry and overcooked. Sisig- another salty dish. I was looking forward to this dish but it just wasn't seasoned well. Very good experience and this joint. This is not your typical drunken noodle, pad Thai place. They've done some funky magic with their menu. Make sure you're ready to wait and also ready for a new experience. Almost every type of Asian food at this restaurant from your choice of Thai, Filipino and Viet. The food was okay with lots of flavor, but the service made the whole dining experience not so stellar. I came here for brunch the other day and we were very excited to try everything, but when we were ordering we named 2 dishes that were only served at dinner (pork belly adobo and coconut rice). The waiter realized they gave us the dinner menu -____- My friend had been here before and was really looking forward to the coconut rice. There aren't THAT many differences between the brunch and dinner menus, but 2/6 dishes we wanted were on the dinner menu. Anyways, we switch up our order. no biggieWhat made our dining experience a 3* was the fact that they forgot our last dish.. the sisig. When we asked about the sisig, they told us it was coming out soon. The sisig ended up coming out  20 minutes after we had finished all our other dishes. There seemed to be a lack of communication with the wait staff and kitchen. The busboys even cleared away our table and dishes thinking we were done even though we were still waiting on our last dish. The waiter could have been honest and told us it was forgotten and allow us to cancel the order because by the time the sisig came out we weren't really hungry anymore and were tired of waiting. Anyways, here are my thoughts about the dishes.. -Khao soi: thai red curry with chicken and egg noodles had a good rich flavor, but the noodles weren't still kind of hard-Pork Jowl: By far my favorite dish. Sliced pieces of pork with well seasoned and grilled brussel sprouts. This was on point with sooo much good flavors. -Papaya salad: this was okay, the papaya was chopped/shredded to thin and the sauce wasn't as sour as I like it. I did like the crispy taro pieces which added a nice crunch since the papaya was chopped very thin. -Sizzling Corned Beef hash: corned beef hash served with a raw egg. It didn't taste like anything special, the corned beef could have had more flavor and more moisture. -Garlic Rice: Okay as well. The rice wasn't too garlic-y which was good. Tasted like a fried rice. -Sizzling Sisig: pork head with raw egg on a hot plate. There was a lot of cartilage or soft bone in this which i didn't particularly like. The flavor was okay..not worth the extra 20 minute wait. Pig and Khao is a great example of a cool fusion spot that you've had on your list, but maybe haven't tried yet. It's worth the hype. I've been dying to check out this place for brunch (and hope to still!). I ended up finally paying a visit for their little-known tasting menu. The menu is at a pretty good steal, $45/person. There's not a separate tasting menu, but you get a taste of some things on the menu (and some surprises). It was delicious and ample amounts of food. The set up was more family style verses individual plates. We received a total of five courses plus dessert. Separately, I ordered their Vietnamese coffee with a shot of rum added. It was delicious (not normally with rum, fyi). First course was the duck roll. It was a nice burst of flavor, really tasty and a perfect amuse-bouche. Our second course was the papaya salad. I've seen this dish on Thai menus for years, but have never tried it. It was light and refreshing. The third course was my favorite (oh hey butter ), the Malaysian Butter Prawns. The sauce was incredible, with a nice bread crumb coating. Between the two of us, we had about 2-3 prawns per person! Fourth course was pad see ew with beef. It was another great dish, and was also nice to get different types of protein with each meal (I would assume you could get this menu vegetarian friendly upon request). Fifth course was a noodle soup. The broth was really unique, almost sour. I can't recall the meat in this dish, but it was perfectly cooked. Dessert was a frozen rice pudding-like dish with ice cream. It tasted like cereal milk, and according to my friend, was similar to a dish in the Dominican. We both left very very full (we had to take course five home!). The interior was open and larger than expected. Staff was very attentive. I would highly recommend! Excellent spot for a bottomless brunch, managing to offer solid mimosas with yummy food. Most of the time when I go for a boozy brunch I feel like I have to sacrifice the food element, but here you don't have to compromise!Love that they offer different flavors of mimosas including lychee and mango. They also have bottomless beer option but you have to serve yourself from the back of the restaurant which makes it a much less attractive option. I'm not sure why they don't just fill up a pitcher of beer for you the same way they do with mimosasFood here isn't your typical brunch food, and leans a bit more towards the heaviness of lunch. I love that the menu go beyond the realm of classic brunch foods (i.e. eggs benedict) and offers something unique. Also the dishes feel more like they're meant for sharing than as individual brunch dishes which is what we ended up doing. We tried:Khao Soi - Creamy and a tad spicy. It was fine but I couldn't help comparing it to the version I had at SriPraPhai which I enjoyed more. Sigsig - Yummy (if not very healthy). The pork is tender and flavorful and the flavors seep into the egg as well. Would have been too heavy for me to eat by myself but liked trying it.Banh Xeo - Came recommended by the waitress and tbh was the first thing that caught my eye on the menu, but I didn't see many people mention it, so was ready to pass it up for some of the more popular options until I heard the waitress's recommendations. I'm super glad she did because this was my favorite dish of the brunch. I've never actually had an authentic vietnamese version before so can't say how authentic it is, but on its own merits it's a yummy dish. The crepe is crispy but still a bit chewy inside and the shrimp was juicy and flavorful. And wrapped in lettuce, it feels a healthier than most of the other options on the menu. 2.5 - Had a reservation for 7:30 on a Tuesday night but it wasn't necessary since the restaurant was pretty empty. I didn't have any expectations going in but after looking at their menu I was less than impressed. Does anyone ever get that panicked and awkward feeling when the server approaches a few times and you have no interest in anything on the menu? Their dishes didn't seem appetizing to me whatsoever. If it was up to me I'd up and leave but my friend from out of town wanted to try this place. We shared a few small plates and it was a good amount of food. The most enjoyable dish was the fried mantao buns. I wish they had condensed milk on the side though bc, childhood. Khao soi was good; we got a side of jasmine rice just so we could drench it with the curry base. Yes to extra carbs. (We should've gotten coconut rice!!!) Confused about the grilled pork jowl; it was just brussel sprouts, where's the pork or rice? Pork belly; eh. Too salty and hard to bite into. Sizzling sisig seemed to be a popular dish but my friend and I couldn't eat this. I took a couple of bites and I couldn't handle the soft and gooey texture of this. Also too salty. It didn't sit well with my taste buds. I probably guzzled down more tap water than the actual food itself. Thanks for making sure my water was constantly refilled without me having to ask! Meh. Most of the reviews applaud their brunch but let's just say that if someone suggests this place again, I'm now vegan. Give this place a try. I had the Sisig with my sister and her fiance. It's a dish made from parts of a pig's head and liver i.e. Pork jowls, ears and liver.  We did not care for it, it was very chewy. I wish I would have tried something else on the menu besides this. Next time I'm in town I'll give this place another try I just won't have the Sisig. I had gone today based on a raving recommendation from a friend, and unfortunately, I'm not impressed - it seems that the food represented was more Malaysian than Filipino, and the Filipino representations were a bit lackluster.As a Filipino-American born and raised in the SF Bay Area and have eaten Filipino food all my life, I have always felt that Filipino-fusion food would either be hit or miss. It is hard to impress me when I can easily conjure up a lifetime catalogue of different Filipino cuisines and compare and contrast notes of other ""better"" flavors I've had in the past.I understand that Pig and Khao is not trying to be authentic by any means (hence the ""fusion""), but the flavors for their ""Filipino"" dishes felt lackluster and one-dimensional, as if the Filipino aspects of their food was just an afterthought, something thrown in at the last minute as an interesting oddity to accompany the already semi-typical Malaysian dish.Tonight, we ordered the Khao Soi, Crispy Pata and the Ricotta Donuts. The Khao Soi was good, but there was no interesting edge to the dish beyond it tasting like typical Malaysian flavors; The Crispy Pata was very disappointing - aside from the fact that they achieved the texture that reminded me of lechon, the flavors were very flat - it seemed as if it were only seasoned with S&amp;P and Thai chilis. The sauces didn't help it much, as the sauce flavors were still one dimensional. The point of Filipino food (or even to capture the essence) is to bring in a bunch of seemingly contrasting flavors to create a unique, 3-dimensional taste-bud explosion that you've never had before. This did not wow me at all. The saving grace to this dinner was actually the Ricotta Donuts - The kalamansi custard was very impressive and complemented the rich and fragile texture of the donuts very well. If this restaurant was being marketed as a Pan-Asian fusion restaurant, I would probably give it a higher rating. However, since it's being marketed as a Filipino-Malaysian fusion restaurant, I have to be a bit more critical than usual.I highly doubt that I'll ever visit this place again - I felt that the effort was there, but please give your Filipino food a better representation than what you actually have now...",https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/H4RC30TrOGJcCLePkDYihA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qdelaqphUIzGVTLlWSRETA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OW0lir1OGpSzPPyWf2ua4Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_JeWfaJtF3xZZEVvGvB5mw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mXBBHgWAIkFTwrp94lkOUA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MGvINRq4rR8744VdJ7WVtw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/J2s0PQenO0kNotwWm43F6A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HD023tz7jqHy-SBEehSI3A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xxNcTv0DiEcmsHq3p4JTAg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_c8eUPNIGfWlCexZeBlqQA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QLq2Y2l74oQPbaHsDc_Rfg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zOi1MYQrwFPiIlu_WNd6Tw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/aFRQRCQGOmplJtAfaZxicQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-uOuXpW6Ox-JHkFBbCpMQg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/j4BVcZ8L6ihMC31GYwL6nA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gUyANsgHuBp1XP3CEKD7fg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9zmsGCN-wZf7zGlXUMUyZg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NjBVRIbz7zA3NuZFLVkxQw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RXABahE0LobBeheiQfav6w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ehKJ572vSZcN2iJUTcmJWw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Q5zK89WCad5KI_e4tfMeSg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4FanE06f9Y5pxL2sgxS5Jw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BZhxNahBjXYSsAiNDNiasw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/K_wuMNiFoStwbndSrDC8iA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4-4XI8grnw4l947QyAJaXQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9naCymopk-p44AyU70E-8Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bpU0UJOXhHuZaW0kV5Clww/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7UNluQGA2TE1OFWqgHV8TA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yVaT0KVtirEsfyKrTKDNUg/258s.jpg,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/prune-new-york,prune-new-york,New York,10002,NY,American (New),Breakfast & Brunch,NA,"We came across Prune the last night of a recent trip to the city, while we were waiting for seating at a different restaurant (which we ultimately didn't go to).  We were walking down 1st, hungry and impatient, and there was Prune, welcoming us on a cold, dark, December night, with its brightly lit storefront.They were able to seat us immediately (it was Sunday, and late), and the server was genuinely warm and cheery.  Because we arrived late, we were the last customers in the restaurant by the end of our meal, but they didn't make any attempt to rush us out, or make us feel unwelcome.The food was good, if not spectacular; we had eaten at Estela a couple days before, and Prune's cuisine does not rise to that level of concept or execution.  But that's an unfair comparison on my part; the joy of Prune is the simple casualness of it all.  The diners at Prune appeared to be regulars, in everyday dress, unlike their glammed-up counterparts at Estela.  People were there for their wedding anniversary, or an in-depth conversation on the social ramifications of something-or-the-other.  There was a neighborhood-y feel to the whole thing.  The food was simple but satisfying, and there's something to be said for a restaurant in NYC where you can get seated immediately, and enjoy good food in a nice atmosphere, without too much fuss or hassle.So go to Estela instead, that way we'll be able to get a seat at Prune the next time we're back in the city. Recommended to me by a local, we were able to spot it easily: On a freezing cold day, it was the only restaurant on the street with a line outside the door. I took my fussy 9-yr old and got a seat. Super friendly hostess and staff. Tiny place, warm and cheery. I got the spicy chickpea egg dish (not spicy really), and my child got a cheese omelette with a side of Pullman bread. All the food was delish and satisfying. I recommend trying the chickpea dish because it's different, full of protein, and it works. The only thing that was amiss (and the 4 of 5 stars) was the terrible coffee...tasted like hot water. A truly divine brunch spot should have great coffee.With your check they provide adorable little black licorice bites. I dislike black licorice but did admire the little doggie shaped pieces. This is a NYC one and done restaurant. As mentioned in many reviews here, the service really detracts from the food. Don't show up early for your table, you are seated at the exact time of your reservation. That may seem like a plus but it isn't when you show up 15 minutes early thinking you could have drink before you sit. NO!!!  You are directed to go down the block to the ""boilermaker""to have a drink and wait. Listen, if I wanted an east village frat bar experience I would not be dining at Prune.  Yes the food was decent but it came with snark from minute one. I had the whole branzino, well roasted accompanied by nothing but olive oil (needed salt and acid). Leon had a flavorful lamb stew,however his chief comment was how salty the meat was. Since I will never come back, if I knew how cool the ""Disco pistachios"" were I would have gotten them.  They are put on fire at the table!!! A highlight is the naan brought out when you are seated as well as their play on burek. Food is good, but NYC has thousands of good restaurants, what is the compelling reason to come here? We dined at Prune on New Years Eve with mixed feelings.  The food was absolutely incredible!  However, the pace of the meal was unacceptable.  We reserved the 9:30 pm dinner seating (prix fixe menu) and our actual meal concluded around 10:15/10:20 (exclusive of dessert; inclusive of the ""snack tray,"" an appetizer, and a main course).  We took a break prior to dessert in a failed attempt to prolong the meal.  It was even more baffling since we were the last diners to occupy our table for the evening!  Service was warm and attentive - it's our belief that the kitchen expedited the food since every other table was rushed in the same manner.  For $100/plate with multiple courses, I expect the meal to last two hours.  I also expected a complimentary midnight champagne toast... but we weren't about to fiddle around at our table for over an hour to wait for this privilege.  Several tables cleared out prior to 11 pm (we departed around 11:15 pm).  Highly disappointed and I would not return despite the delicious fare.  So, on to the meal itself.Upon being seated we were promptly served the ""snack tray,"" consisting of deviled eggs, shrimp and tartar sauce, raw oysters, cheese balls, and caviar topped crackers.  It was a perfect amuse-bouche.For appetizers, we ordered the bay scallop ceviche and foie gras terrine and cipollini agrodulce.  The scallops were super fresh and the taste was out of this world (really dig the use of cilantro).  Also impressed with the amount of foie gras served!  For mains, we ordered the dover sole meuniere and spicy shellfish and finfish stew.  The sole was incredibly flavorful - moist, buttery, and delicious.  The spicy shellfish and finfish stew featured a generous display of clams, mussels, prawn, and finifish (obviously).  Really solid dish.For dessert, we both ordered the tarte tartin.  I'm normally not a dessert person, but A+.  P.S.  I am so glad that I did not order the prune burger.  The table next to us did... tiny portion of side fries and average sized burger.  For $100/plate, huh?  That's not right.  My girlfriend and I were discussing what makes a restaurant great on the cab ride home.  NYC is littered with talented chefs... that's just the ante to play the game.  ""Hospitality"" is what makes a restaurant ""great.""  Sadly, despite a headline celebrity chef, Prune falls short of the mark. Dishes dont get the best looking award but the food does! One of the best american brunch in town. The steak were medium rare like we requested and the oyster omelette was very good. Seatings are very limited, it's a small restaurant, make sure to arrive verg early or late around 3ish, you won't have to wait for a table. We came here on a Saturday morning around 11am without having made a reservation. One of the staff told us it would be around a 30 minute wait. We ended up being called a little before the 30 minute mark, but took seats at the bar. The ambience inside is very Parisian, and quaint. My friends and I were ready to order, and I asked one of the wait staff about the 'youth hostel breakfast' to see what a lanjaeger was. The first waiter I asked wasn't sure, and it was kind of strange to see him go and ask another waiter, who also didn't know what it was. The third waiter they asked, got back to us and informed me that it was a dried blood sausage. Both my friends ordered the eggs benedict, which was pleasant, but not amazing. I was really happy with the 'youth hostel breakfast'. Described simply on the menu, it consisted of fish pastes, grainy breads, liverwurst, lanjaeger, and some condiments, like mustard and marmalade. The fish pastes were produced in Sweden, and utterly delicious with the grainy bread. This is not really an accurate representation of the cooking at Prune though, as nothing on my plate required cooking, but still delicious. My friend liked the fish pastes so much, she went home and ordered them on Amazon. Service by the waiters was sassy and friendly. Will likely return as it is a local spot, but probably not the best brunch around. I had been wanting to visit Prune for the longest time after watching Chef Gabrielle Hamilton on Mind of a Chef. I was a little weary from the low yelp reviews, but the latest review from NY Times convinced me to give this place a shot. I came on a rainy Sunday at around 11AM. Despite the weather, there was already a line out the door. The wait for a party of two wasn't bad though - only 20 minutes. Inside, the restaurant is beautiful. It has the vibe of a french bistro, but with a modern twist - the lighting is bright and they're playing throwback rock in the background. The space was definitely cramped, but I didn't mind it too much. When we got our menus, I literally wanted to order everything. I was torn between the monte cristo and the fried oyster omelette, but decided to get the omelette with a side of stewed chickpeas since it was more unique. My friend got the eggs benedict. The food was incredible. The fried oyster omelet had the perfect texture - the oyster was crispy, the tartar sauce inside was creamy, and the omelette was tender, just like how a french omelette should be. The spicy remoulade that went with it also added a nice kick to an otherwise rich dish. I ordered the side of chickpeas because I was worried an omelette by itself wouldn't be enough, but it was actually quite filling. The chickpeas were good, but not as memorable. My friend's egg benedict looked really good as well. It came with a giant potato rosti, which was a nice change from the usual home fries you get for brunch. Overall, even though this is on the pricier side, I would definitely come back again! A little conflicted when writing this review. Very delicious food (grilled shrimp, beef cheeks, yams, roasted onions, lemon semifreddo, caramel crouton) and pretty good service during the meal. But then as we were signing the check an employee said we had to hurry up because they had another reservation waiting for a table. I understand it being busy in a tiny restaurant, but that just leaves an extremely negative feeling after a good meal. Pretty disappointing All around great experience in an off the beaten path/Bowery location. Heard about Prune via an NPR interview with chef Gabrielle Hamilton.  Loved her take on dining at Prune - the experience of spending time with friends and loved ones is the star of the show - not an over the top presentation of the food. Prune lived up to her description.  Welcoming atmosphere and great service. Had the beef cheeks while my spouse and son had the branzino. All fantastic and hearty portions. The desserts were even better - bitter orange creme brulee was our favorite.  Only one slight drawback is that the restaurant space is tight.  If you show up early for your rez - you may have to stand outside in the cold (gasp!) - so bring a hat and gloves! Food was outstanding! (Best beef cheeks we ever had)Nice ambience and impecable service through out the dinner until the manager (tall brunette lady) came in a quite agressive way to tell us that if we were gonna order more food we would need to leave our table and sit at the bar to finish our meal. Only 50 min passed since we were seated (6:30pm) and 40 min since our first plate arrived. Quite inappropriate. Specially for a party of 2 on a Tuesday night at 7:20pm that were loving the food and wanted to try a couple more appetizers.I completely understand that you have to manage timing in the tables in smart way to be able to seat next reservations, but that was certainly not well managed.Scolding our server in front of us for letting us order more food was even more awkward and kind of ruined our mood during dinner. We left 15 min after. This happened Tuesday November 28th. Bestie had been wanting to go to Prune for brunch for years so I finally took her for her birthday this past weekend.  Tiny restaurant so you  may have to wait but shouldn't be too bad for a small party.  We were seated right by the window which was lovely for people watching.I had the caraway seed &amp; sour cream omelette which was perfectly done.  Bestie had the Monte Cristo and said it was really good.  Not rushing to come back, but it's a good option in the area. Small, topDrawer restaurant.  From beginning to end, the service, food and congenial attitude of the staff made this a memorable dinner.  Cocktails were creative. The eggplant, mushroom, and leek appetizers were great openers.  The branzino , mussels and shrimp entrees raised the bar. Three desserts for five of us put the finishing touches on a perfect evening.  (The cookies served with the lemon semifreddo melted in our mouths.  Served by superb wait person made this a dining experience we will treasure.  Ro, Curt, Arnie, Sharon and David. Went for brunch Sat with a group of six. Food was fantastic, service was attentive and helpful. I had the chickpea with eggs and it was phenomenal. Other dishes at the table were great as well. Fantastic Bloody Mary menu also. Definitely recommend. Just a heads up they won't seat incomplete parties. Wow, this place is really good.  The food is good -- fish, duck, beef cheeks (name notwithstanding), mussels... desserts ....  Everything is priced very reasonably, especially for New York City, where it seems that you have to pay a premium for everything (although ask me about the $3 knitted cap I got at Duane Reade... you can't get a candy bar in Duane Reade for that price [nor would a candy bar keep your ears warm, especially a small one] and while you could get a cap at the Sheetz in Ashe County for that price [Sheetz #2, near the old oil drum], you'd also have to take the parboiled promotional hot dog with it).  Alcohol is also available and reasonably priced, and it 4,50 euros is a bit more than you'd have to pay for a seize (Kronenbourg 1664) in Paris, it's not that much more.  Maybe it isn't more at all.  Anyhow, this place had the food and the service -- what's with the folks complaining here? everyone was super nice to us -- reminiscent of the kind of small restaurant everyone is looking for in Paris.  Except it is in New York.  Go there.  (But not when I'm looking for a table.) Mediocre food. Slow service. Overpriced for the quality of the food. Don't know why they have good reviews. Tried the Dutch pancake which looked amazing but was too dry. The huevos rancheros was disappointing too. The eggs and the sauce were good but the dish was very badly prepared with some bland black beans, a slice of avocado and a few dry tortilla chips all tossed onto the side of the plate.There were no lines at 2.30pm on Sunday.Wouldn't go back or recommend to anyone. Tons of better places in LES/East Village. Cute and quaint place, reminds me of Scandi/European restaurants. Came here for brunch and was very pleased with the Bullshot Bloody Mary and huevos rancheros. The Dutch pancake was interesting, definitely better than an American pancake. Loved that there's several styles of Bloody's you can get. Definitely come try one! We came to town to celebrate two people's birthdays, including mine. Prune did not disappoint. The food was absolutely delicious, the service was attentive and extremely helpful and we really enjoyed the semi-private room in the basement which gave our party of 6 a little more space and wasn't quite as noisy. Prune reminds me of bistros I've eaten at in Paris, both in the simplicity and deliciousness of the food, as well as the atmosphere which is a little crowded, a little noisy and very inviting.On to the food. I had cream of chicken soup with crispy chicken skin, which was out of this world. It's difficult to hide when something is this simple, but it was delicious and flavorful and the crunch of the skin contrasted nicely with the smoothness of the soup. Then I had duck on a bed of puy lentils with smoked tomato dressing. Absolutely delicious and perfectly prepared. All the other dishes I tasted were equally delicious and very straightforward. This is not precious food by any means, it's solidly prepared, presented in a charming and inviting way and absolutely lovely. And how could I forget the Turkish Disco Pistachios? They took a bed of coarse salt, soaked it in a Turkish anisette called Raki, put unroasted, unsalted pistachios on top and lit it on fire. You have to keep the nuts moving with two large spoons or the fire will go out. This was delegated to me by the server since it took a few minutes. But it was fun and the nuts were delicious. Thanks to the staff at Prune for making my birthday very memorable. This is really a 3.5 star review. A nice small quaint restaurant with a pretty good brunch menu. Be ready to be cramped this is more like communal dining. You're only separated from the table next to you by about 5 inches. The Monte Christo is deep fried. Pretty good and very different. The Eggs Benidict was cooked perfect and delicious. Will like to try dinner one day Stepping into Prune is stepping into an old friend's kitchen. Everyone is there to have a great time with no pretentious attitude, service, or food. Each dish is prepared with care and gracefulness. The tables are close and the space is small allowing you to make conversation with new friends. The service is wonderful and knowledgeable about the menu and pairings. This is a restaurant experience and not just a dining establishment. The chefs and staff want to invite you into the restaurant and provide everything top quality. Would not recommend Prune for people looking to be seen at a fancy restaurant or those who would not appreciate the effort and love that goes into creating Prune. A truly superb experience on all fronts - food, cocktails, service and ambience.Walking into Prune is like walking into a friend's apartment. You can feel the love and dedication that has been invested here. The quality of the ingredients speak for themselves in a simple but exquisite way. There are no gimmicks. You don't get more simple than a parmesan omelet, or an onion sandwich on white bread with chicken liver mousse. The zucchini was prepared in nothing but olive oil. And it was all superb. The mackerel was perfectly seared and the sweetbreads perfectly fried.The staff were wonderful and we exchanged names and a handshake on leaving.What a pleasure, we shall be back - often!",https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AMHLBs6scowhOm71qASVnQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EmtKwMCFl7zq0JcFVJWXjw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tA5L1mtEh_G3rleg2zAZKw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/J9drEAPyFu7K4Ypc_G40Rw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cs4iIgRPRf0JkVkXZtALog/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Iy-YfaC3-vz09TUPNuADYQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/X7tvALTY8M8LidxpY2aukQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qjKn3EBxDnkHARVU2Z7MIw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UUPlX7Px9VzlfnUGafujyA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Yxx59dLd4K7L7W3n1ImOrg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/G8cK72Wz3RBzg4dBVhUpJw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SRT0pQlIlSEK-FUoLwZHww/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Wwp9zq2BjIIWgZrY0izX5w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Jrxh6B1Mlvo2PVSWMLP_2A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ne7zRwhtSYesyf7S2AVMhA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GrlJfE56ByBCILFasi-omg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/E6xfccebbo6QBtVTSApmTg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tEV-gvCv_bk7WSxzCRZqBg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QdDsW2wG92wfN8GzI2_2aw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dCYr0QXlZ_xElevHvAkJ8w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zOn5G8mCkCf-aJ4hb4pCWw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yCil8MHd8oAmuPLbuMOicw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gvCRJbjhBaVvYW7zc3dxRg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cEgnQJylc_23OCbVcEi1XQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jffMrUVqBUK1grF6iafinw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nCmTrKAE8cbznNShlmxtGQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Xw8cTSqfMe3ThfNuigM9Ag/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/sz_ip6hi9ApkHIKoflc85g/258s.jpg,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/rizzos-fine-pizza-new-york-4,rizzos-fine-pizza-new-york-4,New York,10002,NY,Pizza,Wine Bars,NA,"We happened to walk into Rizzo's after not going into Ivan Ramen because of their long wait. Ivan Ramen's waiting time turned into the perfect opportunity to find another restaurant nearby, and on the way out we saw Rizzo's. After walking in, we went on Yelp to find that the reviews were great and I am writing here to concur with that opinion. I am not a fan of thin crust, but the thin sicilian pizza is the perfect combination of soft but cruncy. Their pizza has the crunchy exterior as a sicilian slice should, but the dough is a little raised and that is where the pleasantly soft texture comes in. Do not expect to feel like your teeth are going to break while eating a square personal pizza- the thinnes of the crust helps to ensure that it stays soft. I also had caramalized mushrooms on my pizza and they were probably the best mushrooms I ever had.Because I cannot stay away from carbs when I am at an italian restaurant, I went a little wild and also ordered their chicken parmigiana. They hit the nose with their chicken; the breading was soft and almost buttery, and the chicken itself is pounded down to the perfect thickness (that of which is narrow, lightweight, but filling). The penne was also satisfying, although I am not sure if the pasta was homemade. The sauce it was paired with was very tomatoe based and therefore took on a darker color, it was not sweet and simply tasted like tomatoe but it was versatile in the sense that it paired nicely with the chicken parm.Our server, Bugsy, was also very amicable. He was forthcoming and even offered us cannolis on the house. He truly made our experience full, pointing out the history of Rizzo's beginning in Queens. He was well-informed about the restaurant and his service was prompt but relaxed and aware. I will certainly be coming back after this experience to try the vegan cheese. It is one of the few affordable italian restaurants that has impeccable food in Manhattan- I would recommend. I'll keep this simple.My husband and I tried this place while staying with a friend in Queens. It was just supposed to be a quick meal;, something to get us through the evening. Just pizza.WE ATE THE WHOLE PIZZA.I've never had pizza this good in my entire life. The crust is amazing - so thin and light that it doesn't weigh you down. Sauce? Amazing. Pepperoni and mushrooms? To die for.That had to be a fluke, we thought, so we tried it again a month later.Nope. Not a fluke.This 'za is absolutely amazing. We've enjoyed both the Chelsea/Soho and Queens (sliiiiightly better) locations. Delizioso! My wife and I are long time customers, since Rizzo's opened. We like this place and do not want to do it any harm. So to the owner Bugsy: If you let me know you read this review and care, I will remove it or even change it to something more positive.Last night ,the two of us went to Rizzo's for dinner. The way it works is we order our slices of pizza from the pizza side through a door on the left side and then we sit at the bar on the right side, order our drinks and it gets sent over to us. We always order 4 slices, but 2 at a time so the second slices are hot. Last night at 6:05, we ordered our 2 slices and the pizza girl told us ""It will take a few minutes cause the pies were in the oven."" I told her no problem, take your time thinking it would be a few minutes or so. We sat at the bar where 3 out of the 5 beers taps were out, so I had to settle for a Pilsner instead of a Stout or an IPA. Disappointing but OK, I can deal with that. A half hour later no pizza came yet, so we inquired and we were told it's on the way. Another 15 minutes passed and we asked again where are our 2 slices? We were told coming right up. 15 more minutes went by and we asked again what happened to our order? By now we have had our drinks on an empty stomach and we were getting frustrated. The bartender asked on our behalf what happened to the order. They told her that they kept selling the pizzas to other customers who ordered whole pies and our 2 slices were almost ready. We noticed that at least 12 customers came in after us, all got served their pizzas and paid their bill and left. Finally it was 7:20. We gave up on being lied to, went home hungry and made something to eat at home. On the way out we approached the girl who B.S.ed us and told her we weren't happy. She said, ""Well, you told me to take my time."" I said I didn't mean almost an hour and half or the next day! I mean 2 slices wasn't exactly a big or difficult order. She roller her eyes at me. Bugzy, we are locals and we like your place, but there is too much pizza competition in the neighborhood for this kind of poor service. Yes, you make good pizza, but so do other pizzerias. Unless biz is so good you don't need so many customers, something has got to be addressed here. I don't want to rant, but it's not the first time we had problems at Rizzo's, but I didn't complain until now. Pizza was delicious!!! Super tasty food and garlic knots were warm and flavorful. We definitely enjoyed this experience of NY pizza at its finest. Pizza looked amazing and had great texture. My husband ordered the bbq chicken and I ordered the one with marinara, ricotta, garlic and spinach and it was fantastic. Waiter was super cool with us and treated us very nice. There's an informal spot to the left where you can order pizza by the slice, and a sit-down restaurant to the right. I tried their squared pizza with artichokes and spinach, and another one with garlic and ricotta. The dough was light and airy, so it you like that type you'll be happy. I prefer a more traditional type of dough (thicker and more chewy), so I wasn't much of a fan. Fresh ingredients though. I came here expecting a quick and cheap bite seeing the great rating, but I'm not a fan for their pizza. I ordered slices from the counter to go, one margherita and one pepperoni. I normally don't mind the thin crust as long as it has a good texture - either has some chew or crisp, I like both. But their crust is almost powdery and flaky like a cookie? I really don't get the appeal of that. Also because it is so thin, the pizza got cold really fast. I also paid 8 dollars for two slices. It's lower east side people, and those are thin crust slices...I think 8 dollars is a little overpriced. Food, service and ambiance was amazing! So chill and we had a large group so they accommodated us, gave us nye champagne and cannolis (homemade) Such good pizza! Salads were dope and come a bread bowl! Amazing thin crust pizza. Just delicious flavor and superior ingredients. We tried a regular round pie a regular square pie an Americana pie (BBQ chicken) and loaded garlic knots.Everything was 5 stars. The garlic knots are addictive and a must get. All three pizzas are great. I liked the Sicilian better then the round because of the crust. The BBQ chicken was probably the best I've ever had. Delicious BBQ sauce and fresh ingredients. Was super happy about my order here and really enjoyed the food The garlic knots are a MUST have. During happy hour the wine was $3 and the service was excellent. Our waiter was very nice...he even brought us a complimentary cannoli. So a review of pizza doesn't come easily for me. I'm an east coast native and, therefore, nothing in this country comes close to New York pizza. That being said, Rizzo's is possibly one of the best pizza spots I've ever been to. The garlic knots are mind blowing, the pizza crust is thin with everything down to the ricotta being homemade, the cannoli is like grandma's and the staff feels like your family. Bugsy and Nancy are two of the most welcoming people - they make the place special as much as the food. Huge thank you to their hospitality! I plan on being a regular as often as I'm in New York. Untilnext time, I'll be dreaming of Rizzo's. I feel like pizza places with framed reviews on their walls and make claims that their pizza is ""famous"" always have the most mediocre ambience, service, and food. My friend and I tried their ""famous"" square pizza...in a city full of great pizza, it was at the worse end of experiences. It reminded me of the kind of pizza you get in southeast Asian countries which make an attempt to create a pizza like food (meant to cater to western tourists) that resembles pizza but doesn't taste anything like what you were craving. The perfect thin crust pizza in NYC. I am not sure where they are located. I ordered delivery on the CAVIAR app. Thin crust with great sauce. I tried both the square personal size as well as the large round. On a whim I ordered the nutella pizza. It's not much to look at but it was delicious. I love Rizzo's from when I was first introduced to it on Steinway. I was so excited when they opened on MacDougal St and so disappointed when they closed down there. SO HAPPY they have found a neighborhood that is a good fit for them in Manhattan and OVERJOYED that it is walking distance. My husband had the gluten-free Americana (bbq chicken) and pepperoni pizzas, and absolutely loved them! In comparison to their normal pizzas, the crust is much thinner, almost cracker-like, but still chewy and very good. I honestly prefer the gluten-free crust over their normal crust, although, you can request an even thinner crust (I'll have to try the thinner crust next time). I had a friend over for the weekend, and she agreed that the gluten-free was better - it is THAT good!The loaded garlic knots here are delicious as well. I expected little knots, and was pleasantly surprised with a plate of six giant knots! Very, very filling but oh so delicious! Looking at the yelp reviews it seems they used to have an option for 3 knots, instead of 6. I would have liked that instead, but 6 is great for sharing. Overall, we highly recommend Rizzo's for their gluten-free pizza! My husband has celiac sprue and had no problems afterward.The one downside is that this place is cash only. I like it thick. With depth. Chewy and soft. You could say I'm more of a deep dish dame. BUT Rizzo's crispy thin circle pies have got me singing a different tune.This is a cozy little pizza joint in LES. Service was phenom. Definitely recommend the monster knots. Kind of remind me of savory baby cinnamon rolls. Instead of icing and cinnamon it's cheese and bacon. So much good.For the circle pie we got the Quarto Formaggio. No marinara on it but stinking good and so crisp you can hear the crackle and crunch. Also without any overwhelming char which is usually my gripe with brick oven thin crust. Too much black cancer. But not at Rizzo's.We also wanted to try the square pizza which has a thicker but still crunchy crust. We got the Verdura so it was loaded with veggies. I usually love veggie pizza but I thought it was lacking in flavor. A little earthy though so if you're into that maybe try it.Definitely want to return for the happy hour- dollar beer or 3 dolla wine with a slice or something. And I think it's daily until 7pm. Don't quote me on that. But def will return. This is by far one of the best pizzas I've had in a while. It is a good thin crust. The sauce is to cheese ratio is perfect. We ordered delivery and food came on time, hot, and delicious. Can't wait to order again!!! First time visit. Awesome service and super friendly staff. Good pizza with $1 beer! Would definitely come back again!!! My boyfriend and I ordered delivery on a Friday night. The delivery guy was very nice. The pizza and garlic knots got cold when it arrived but it was still delicious. We also ordered the cannolis. Pizza: we ordered the divola pizza, it had a kick of spicy buffalo sauce on it. I didn't taste the mozzarella, or much cheese on top. Garlic knot: it was very flavorful. I like how they chopped up some garlic and garnished it on top. Very tasty. Cannolis: I've had better ones, but hey, can't complain about delivered cannolis. Overall, I will return back to the shop and eat it there. Incredible experience at Rizzos... highly recommend it. The food was delicious and the the staff were brilliant, very friendly and accommodating. Thanks for the amazing service! See you guys again soon Tried a square pizza with the Numu vegan cheese, mushrooms, spinach and olives. The vegan cheese was super realistic and way better than the typical daiya. Now Rizzo's just needs to add some vegan friendly appetizers to the menu .",https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/r4OPoXMhNig7p94wdW9yOA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bHWQTWSbmhD6f4URKwiGlA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Fr8qD0wsSZWdC0baKcGOog/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Frqrudb_wcVYuH-G-XTOmw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0-uUE2wfn82VeIlG6bum8w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DrCxBGL6MkPEpXqM-cuJZA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0D6wZnZ_f3Ft4c31gHz0WA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qrrj8zjNNyumFvTGkv_7Tg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/b5jA8PI_ucl_J2vOnjPwBw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vFvNPMrmreFsnF6YvdWHag/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2le9mX0WfD8K32vS6_0pPw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9b8fNV2VHQ9jreqbkTxuNg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UnyddKtM9zh_TmNf3ZUXKA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7RxP-pScYvdTTPgzUuLqKQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rdVT9ZD292D0uXeX_gLhBA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dFILHDxm--2UL33-0FZodQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nlqjSouu9GZgZ6VZC-XPJg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NQ5BuOO9xB5XfiglZNabZA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-TPc991Abq0NJJUcpIc46Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/csHAmDAS84Hl0OHiTneMuw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XsaUTnpq3n8McOA9PjWynA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hKeG0HU-9ZPYGZrYm-eLNA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/19jo6kZcuDpjbnhw2QE1IA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TO1S-tJvPcTkQWLz_npgZQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/S8cGiyzWJ5UfM1ayAey5Iw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PdONpkiZX9Py-vVamqkRHg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IdfYStZiuh3LF4D8jTscig/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BYremdyKzrdUHUja0wfCUA/258s.jpg,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/roasting-plant-new-york-4,roasting-plant-new-york-4,New York,10002,NY,Coffee & Tea,NA,NA,"Roasting Plant is a little hidden box of coffee heaven.  Although it's a tiny place, keep in mind that this is New York, and that's all you need.  They have really high quality beans from which just enough beans are vacuumed through tubes to grind right before your cup is brewed.This is the type of coffee that is best served without any additives.  Otherwise the complex flavor will get muted.  They still have cream, milk, and sugar for all the people who need it anyway.I've been to their main location on the West Side so many times, too.  I have also been to their Detroit location and was pleasantly surprised to bump into it there. Ive been here twice to grab a drink. Ive only had their chai latte so i cannot comment on their coffee. The chai latte is very fragrant and i can do w or w/o sweeteners. However, their coffee do smell reallyyyy good! I also think the whole set up where u see the beans run thru the pipes is pretty cool! Never seen that elsewhere.The staff are also very nice and friendly. There are charging stations and 3 seats alongside the left wall (upon entering) and they have a full section stocked w creamers, milk, sugars etc. to add to ur drink.It is a small coffee shop and w only 3 seats and armrest space. Could be a nice place to get some work done or kill time. They do have a bench outdoor as well.No bathrooms, atleast none that i saw. I popped in for a quick coffee run on Saturday night since I had a bit of time before meeting up with friends for dinner in the area. The baristas were super nice and very helpful when I had questions about the menu. I highly recommend Roasting Plant based on the wonderful service alone! The coffee was good and tasted really good. They have this very interesting way of making iced coffee - definitely go give it a try. Craving a nice cup of strong coffee? Get their micro-brewed supercharged. I usually drink my coffee black, but I couldn't with this because of how strong it was. It was so strong that it had me lightheaded, but wide-awake 8 hours after drinking it. Roasting Plant not only has an innovative way of storing and serving their coffees (with the use of suction tubes) but they also offer coffee from all over the world. The first time I visited this place, I tried a coffee from Kenya (wasn't sure of the official name) but I found it to be not as strong as the Supercharged.  Not only do they offer coffee, they also sell cookies (I heard they're good) and other bakery pastries. Overall, I've had a great first two experiences here. The staff were courteous and efficient and I'll definitely be back here the next time I'm looking for a cup of strong coffee whenever I'm in the area. I was in LES and in need of power joe, and I knew I wouldn't have to walk far.""Where did you get that?"" I asked the nearest spied coffee drinker.""Roasted plant down the street."" He replied with a nonchalant subtle pretension like he taught college.  You know - lower east side persona.  Roasted plant was stylized from top to bottom in a small space that felt like a cellar but looked futuristic.""I want a dark roast drip."" I somehow managed to say out of my mouth without begging on my knees.I spied an electronic screen menu board with a complicated lay out that projected overly braininess. ""We actually don't have dark roast."" The hipster girl beamed with a high chirp like a robot.  I was in outer space.  This was all preplanned.  (The darkest roast they had was a Sumatra which they would define as medium bodied.)I'm screaming in my head -""You're a speciality coffee shop and you don't have dark roast ??   Is this some kind of snobby coffee aficionado BS ??""""Ok. Let me just reevaluate the options.""I responded sounding a bit stiff and psychotic like Patrick Bateman.The formality was a bit over the top.  But that's ok, someone's taking stuff seriously.I ordered a triple americano $3.25 that was absolutely delicious - creamy, with depth, wonderful flavor, nutty, not bitter.  Worn wood floors hold up some staged machinery, one in the store front window looked like a robot that was percolating coffee.  The other set up was a wall of different beans available for wholesale, with some industrial tubing connected, for what purpose I have no clue. I sat on one of the three cushioned seats that lined the wall each separated by a white plastic flat top.  I drank my wonderful brew as I watched beautiful cool people dash in for iced coffees in this 15 x 10 foot space.   At two different times the room was drowned in different loud whirring mechanical noises.   Even if it was a gimmick, or even necessary, it was really uncomfortable.  There's benches outside but it's more of a come and go place, mainly due to the insane noise antic.GimmickyHipster Tiny Great coffee With the serious roasting tubes on display I expected the Americano to be above average, but it was a bland wash and a disappointment. There are a few tables here, but it's more of take out place. I will be heading up to the coffee place just up the street the next time. If you like coffee, this is a great no frills spot.Not much in the way of seating and snacks but they've got tons of beans that they'll grind fresh for your morning cup. I always just get a black cup of whatever strikesme that day and it's on the better end of decent-not the best I've ever had but pretty darn good. It can be a little expensive depending on what you order but I think the prices are more or less standard for what you're getting and the service is friendly and prompt.Great spot if you're a real coffee lover-no super sweet ""coffee drinks"" here. Unbelievably good coffee. If you have a sensitive stomach and caffeine tends to bother you, order the Guatemala Capetillo Blend. You won't regret it I was in the market for some whole roasted coffee beans for and the Roasting Plant was down the street from my hair salon. I arrived to an empty shop late on a Saturday afternoon and placed my request for Chemex-conducive beans. The guy manning the counter asked if I preferred dark or light roast and I requested both since it really depends on my mood.  He got to work preparing two bags, a Brasil and a Sumatra, and the total came to about $20.  Well, imagine my surprise when I got home and the coffee was already ground...not a happy surprise.  The grind is nicely coarse so I don't really mind, but there's something about grinding my own that gives me a weird satisfaction.Next time I'll make sure the beans are whole... Amazing service and best espresso/ matcha around. Super strong coffee which is always a plus, and it consistently smells of delicious baked goods and fresh roasted beans. Supreme coffee and cafe latte. Feel like a million bucks drinking such delicious brews. six bucks for a blue mountain single origin, freshly roasted, latte!  Where else can you find a deal like that? Awesome. This place is super cute! It's a grab and go place but they do have several seats for you to sit. When you order your coffee, you can see the beans get sucked up by the pipes and to the counter. It makes a really loud noise but it's super fun to watch.I got the tiramisu latte! It actually tasted like tiramisu and was really delicious. Got some brazil coffee beans from here. They were really good. Will go again. These coffee tubs are pretty cool - very Willie Wonka. The coffee is delicious (of course) and you can customize it with plenty of free stuff if you want to (many options to sweeten it, some spices...) Also appreciated during the super hot summer: the A/C is strong in that one! This is such a cool coffee place. Seating is very very minimal though, but the drinks are good. I tried my friends house coffee, it was strong but really good. Make sure to check out the beans in the tubes coming down to the front when you order coffee. Just as good as the best coffee i had in portland oregan (my fav at the time) now i dont have to wait to be on the westcoast to get good coffee, made the way it was meant to be.  Worth the price, had a triple americano and tasted like angiant espresso! In a good way!  Will be back when visiting mom and pop again. This place is the real mccoy, wish they would have setup near planet donut for their business to be better but its close enough. If the owners read this i highly suggest you take the place of that pizza school near that famous donut sspace Good coffee and a great staff. A happy barista staff can be a bit of a rarity in New York City. Always kind, polite, and helpful, not to mention the best and freshest coffee that I've ever found in New York City. Cheers to them! Best Americano ever. (Of course, I chose Jamaican Blue Mountain roast!) I've been personally roasting small batches of coffee for the past 10 years. This place is the most unique coffee business I've seen. Not only can you purchase green / raw beans home to roast, you can also choose your own bean when you buy a cup of coffee, drink, or espresso! If you haven't been here or have no idea what I'm talking about, you need to check it out.  Great customer service and awesome coffee! Manager was pretty rude here. Asked me to sit in the corner cause all I wanted was some coffee. I ended up ordering some food and drinks, but still made me feel as I Was being a burden to her even being here.",https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/azn_VW5eAw5jML4yIk6Qxg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4plfSdGFbb96_W8Ck6iR5Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/q7mHXt34HobgK6mequgElw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pj0G8_RPDHgFZXtZeIkhzQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/j34CstZ7mAwsCqyGJdQRxQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Hjx802CeoT9b8yUNvqfAWA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/I9MIrUH6y-NdMGI7103Uog/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8Z9OK6HlQl__LUEpLz-TsQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XPgUGHPWWi5o1ex69PsyWQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/c9DZEOJZgSKCel4P76uq1g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/y6NiJFYUIwAHKYBv6LTDfg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OqvUU3fZxeeo2cDgTfFK3A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jLhFDhK2rMSyL-JG2hInZA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/d7T2ybAL2yeV6S0VsfLiwQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0kp03G7NtSov-IkCsa6MLQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BMJtrPviq16MypjFg-Xhjw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wLKRHLn1C64JK4-AG_zLAg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/g6LrWlxitLYTpigVGdVJEA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AZGB9ZCgBX806-tqii44NQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BMlKCLKMDH1bshEnll9cWw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/H2lFDhmPLeeOdoL6YHa2dQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5tBRKPLuaD81zlc0qCdNdw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nrHi2pfPnxAI6qihqbYjcQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AS9QLhKhMZlfvZbvKQGEwg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vsXx6Fi-GdOZ9oAPBbVYSQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mfDivHugWgyaCDALoB3oAA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IUhdCi0qoohQ6BRhuzVWIw/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/rockwood-music-hall-new-york,rockwood-music-hall-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Music Venues,Bars,NA,"Awesome live band music and it's unique on how they structured two separate rooms to showcase the music groups!  One has to go out and enter the other corner building to get to the other music venue, but it's the same place altogether - just with different bands playing! Drinks can be ordered and the music was pleasant.  Enjoyable time, but one can't hold a conversation if you're looking for thA little bit of rock style, but down under.  Underground and aspiring artists making their way in NY! My motto in NY - if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere! I was introduced to Rockwood Music Hall in the last few years thanks to a colleague who was performing at one of the stages. Rockwood reminds me of the bars and places you'd go to see music in Austin or Nashville, intimate and full of wood paneling with an occasional sound interruptions delaying the show. I really haven't had a bad experience at any of the stages thus far.It's a ticketless enterprise and some of the shows are give what you can/suggested donation. Each stage (there's 3) varies in size but all have a bar. None serve food (that I know of) but beware that Stage 3's basement show is a 2 drink minimum. Also Stage 3 is located on Orchard Street around the corner from Stage 1 &amp; 2 located on the eastside on Allen Street. Staff is minimal but do have table service at Stage 3 and 2 so keep a path otherwise they'll push through. I would have rated ""Yay! I'm a fan""***But there was an issue***Last night December 11, 2017 was my first time at Rockwood Music Hall. I was there to see the Amazing Gem, Victory Boyd, she was everything I need on a Monday night. I loved the intimacy of the venue it gave off a nice homey vibe. There's standing room, limited seating, full bar (cash/card), and the space is well kept and clean. I will probably come back.My problem was with the server that night. (here's the run down)I'm sitting up stairs and the server comes over to take my oder and I notice her holding a card reader. I ask, ""Do you take cash?""she says, ""Yes"" I proceed to order and then she says, ""but do you have a card so I can keep your tab open?""Not really seeing the problem at the moment I go into my purse to look for a card (mind you I just had to report card fraud on my main card and I don't like to carry all of my cards at once) I couldn't find my other card at the moment. So she says, ""It's ok, just don't leave without paying."" That was the kicker - like wow this was some discrimination BS! I still did the two drink minimum and tipped her well because over all I had a nice time. I hope that what she did wasn't normal protocol. But what she did is Not ok and needs to be brought to her attention. Peace This place was recommended to us by some friends we made while we were visiting from Columbus, Ohio. I'm not sure what I can say to convey what an excellent time we had- it was kind of magical! We wanted to see live local music while in the city, and this was perfect! All of the staff was SO friendly and welcoming, the musicians were top notch, and the drinks were quick and plentiful. Not to mention the sound was professional and clear! Definitely the cherry on top of our weekend trip to the city, and we will be back in the future! Cool.  If you like music like I do,  live different mix, this place rocks ... pun intended. Good varsity of the best localMusic.  Three stages.  And surrounded by fun bars in the club. Do it and you will enjoy the night. Attended an acoustic performance here last night on stage 2. Rockwood has 3 stages (1-3). There could be multiple performances going on so you'd need to check their schedule. Some are ticketed events and others are not. The rooms are small so they provide for an intimate experience (a plus). My sister goes their quite often and enjoys it. She is in a wheelchair and able to maneuver the space. Drinks were ok. On average they are about $10 which is typical... They don't serve food which would be a great addition to their services. Great space, not overly crowded and run very well. Only wish I had discovered it sooner! I finally got another chance to attend a show at Rockwood Music Hall again; This time I was at Stage Two watching Ben Alessi perform. Having been to two of their stages, I have to say that stage two has much better production value. This stage seems better equipped to accommodate a band, the lighting rigs seemed to have a better range and the acoustics were significantly better. One of the problems with their smaller stage was that the audio seems I loved that stage two had a balcony section for VIP, the view up there must be a lot better. Paying a small cover fee of 5$, I was able to see Ben Alessi perform live. I look forward to seeing what this artist has to offer in the future. I hope that Rockwood continues to offer up and coming artists, its a great chance to catch an intimate show with your favorite artists before they get too famous. Great place and atmosphere. 3 different stages We were going to hit another place up the street but the bartender, Zander I think his name was, pulled us into the side bar and it was awesome.  We ended up talking to the bands that were playing that night.  One of the girls was from my home town and they were on tour in the northeast and this was their last stop before a break. Great vibe would go back for live music Saturday night enjoying Live music in NYC!!!!!As we entered Stage 2 door, there was a ticket fee of $12 per person. Also because we decided to sit upstairs in the table area, there was a mandatory 2 drink minimum per person.  There is no food here, so I suggest you head next door to ""Grilled Cheese"" restaurant order yummy food ToGo and bring it here so you can munch. The Contenders played a segment and they were great. Will post sample Vid! An intimate venue to see a show at. Multiple shows in a night means you can see a lot of music in a pretty short amount of time. I always have a problem with the cost of the drinks. $10 wines mean I have a hard time sticking around for more than one. And it's not like I'm swirling my glass in Venetian botanical gardens. It's just kind of a dark bar space.  Annoyingly, most shows have drink minimums (God forbid you sit down) so it means the wait staff will be harassing you during the shows to ensure you reached your drink minimum.I just want to pay to see the music and be left alone. Great space, good sound, well appointed decor (especially little touches in the bathroom) and always great deals on tunes. They have 3 spaces to see music so it is possible to see one gig and move on to the next. They cram the gigs in as well, often booking a huge bill of multiple acts in one night. Stumbled into this place while about to leave the area. Great bar with versatile live music &amp; eclectic taste. 2 drink minimum to stay in the bar, whats great about it is there are 2 separate sides with different stages, divided with a corridor so that each bar has its own little show. You can jump between either side, and enter through either street. Also a little balcony area with table and chairs to chill for extra room. Absolutely awesome - definitely a place I'll be regularly returning to.They have three stages that have bands performing on them all night, switching every hour / hour and a half. On my first visit, I only saw Stage 1 and Stage 2 - Stage 3 had a cover and we were so impressed by the bands on the other stages that we felt no need to go over there.The bouncer was super friendly, stamped our hands, explained where each stage was and let us right in on a Saturday night. It seems like Stage 1 is almost always free, and Stage 2 is sometimes free later at night. You can check on their site to see if you need to buy tickets for a specific set or not. Even if you do have to buy tickets / pay cover, it's always very fairly priced for some great talent. Drink prices were surprisingly good for a music venue as well, I paid $6 for a bottle of Fat Tire which happens to be one of my favorites.Stage 1 is pretty small and was packed, but Stage 2 was a good space and we could enjoy the music without being crowded in at all. Even when I wanted a drink I was able to get right up to the bar and get served right away.Definitely a great experience with some super talented bands. It is so awesome to know that I have a great music venue like this so close to my apartment - you can look at the lineup of bands literally any night and you'll find a talented band that you'll enjoy. I'll be back - and often! I've been toLouden Swain concerts in the past, but up until recently, I've only been to the ones at conventions. I've also heardJason Manns live on stage, but not in this kind of atmosphere. The hall doesn't seem picky when it comes to the dress code, but it definitely has an alternative vibe to its attire. I wore a black open shoulder dress decorated with silver enochian sigilsand a pair of grey polaroid leggings. It seemed to fit in pretty well with the other angel related items fans wore (most of us are also supernatural fans..so..it just makes sense).We arrived a little early so we got our hand stamps (it serves as a ticket) and went to get some food. Once we got back, we tried to figure out where to line up for stage 2 and had to ask several people. It's a bit confusing since the place has so many different entrances. In hindsight, I'm glad that I looked up the reviews before arriving at this hall. Otherwise, I would have been unable to snag a table on the upper level, and would have been forced tostand behind the hordes of fans on the ground floor. I'm really glad that didn't happen, because I'mpretty short. I wouldn't have been able get pictures, or even see the group over every ones heads. I planned to order a shirley temple (I don't drink alcohol), but they don't serve that on their drink list. Instead, I just ordered orangejuice and my sister got sodas ($4 each). It was a very fair price, since you were pretty much paying to hold your table (or stool in some cases). It's important to know the waitress will take your credit card after your order (you can only pay with a card), and she'll keep it until the end of the concert. I didn't understand that was protocol, until a woman at the next table explained it to me. It does make sense though, otherwise, how could they be sure you'll buy at least two drinks. The lighting for the stage isn't overly bright (like some places). So I was able to get pretty decent videos of their performances. Louden Swain was absolutely fantastic on stage and I loved how exited Rob Benedict got when fans pulled out their kazoos. He was pretty thrilled when the audience joined in with the chorus of 'Medicated' without a hitch. I've got to remember to bring a glow stick when I come in the future. A few of the other fans brought them, and it seemed to add to the excitement of the concert.Overall, I really liked the experience and enjoyed the entire atmosphere of the music hall.I'm planning to head back to this location later in the year for 'The Station Breaks' concert! I came to Rockwood Stage 1 for a show this past Wednesday, specifically to see Sam Pace (who has a hard rock country sound and can play his guitar like nobody's business) and Butch Phelps (a psych rock bluegrass group that sounds like a cross between Bob Dylan and Creedence Clearwater Revival). Both shows were great, and the cover was only $5. Despite the small space the sound was good. There are a few tables around the stage and some seats at the bar, but most people stood and a few of us danced. There's a small dimly lit but clean bathroom in a corner. A beer will run you between $6-$8 and they do have cocktails, as well as a water cooler you can help yourself to. UFO on tap. Nice venue, I'm sure I'll be back! Stage 0 bartender on Oct 28th was super rude to us. I tipped $10 bucks for after ordering drinks for $60, because she was rude. She demanded I tip her at least $14She said she wants us to move toThe back of the bar , because we wants to save the prime spots for people who tip. Refused to serve my second drink because I wouldn't tip her because of her rudeness!!The good thing is she didn't single me out - it wasn't personal. She was rude to a bunch of people. Other folks were saying the same thing when we stepped out for a smoke. This is the rudest experience I've had at a bar even by NY standards. Rockwood is such a prestigious establishment. Please fire her. You guys are doing yourselves a disservice Just had a great time great sound great piano just saw Ronald Reggae to a packed house! I've been attending shows at Rockwood for many years. Back when there was only one stage. My experiences have always been great. I've just never felt compelled to write a review until now. About a week and a half ago I emailed the dreaded info@ email address asking if there were possibly a ticket available for a sold out show. Would anyone even see the email?? My heart hoped someone would read it AND actually respond but my head knew better. Alas, my head was wrong. Someone did respond. And pretty quickly. It wasn't what I wanted to hear, though, that the show was indeed sold out. No tix avails. Then the respondent asked if I wanted to be put on a waitlist. He said he would notify me if something opened up. I said YES but was a little skeptical. But hey, I didn't even expect a human to read the email, let alone respond, so why not keep hope alive, right?You probably know where this is going because there are 5 stars in this review. HE ACTUALLY NOTIFIED ME WHEN A TICKET BECAME AVAILABLE. What the what?!?! Yes, I know that is technically his job and what he should have done. Too often, however, folks don't do their job. I can add great customer service to the list of reasons I keep coming back to Rockwood Music Hall! Big shout out to Nate Kreichman for restoring my faith in info@ email addresses! I used to be a huge fan of Rockwood, especially since it was the first NYC stage I had experience playing on. A couple of years ago, I would have given 5 stars for sure. Although, lately I have been super unsatisfied with my time at Rockwood. The first point that really ticked me off is their drink minimum. I went to a Sunday night show at 10pm, and there was a 2 drink minimum for the 45 minute set I was seeing. Not to mention, the set didn't start until about 10:20, and I wasn't allowed downstairs until about 10:15. I'd rather not get drunk on a Sunday night right before work. On top of that, since the shows are usually only one set at a time, the waitress has to interrupt everyone watching the show to get their second drink order. Rockwood seems to be much more interested in making money than showcasing the amazing music they have coming through their venue and this makes me really upset. They recently re-branded (maybe a year ago?) and made their prices much more expensive. As a performer, it is already difficult to get friends/fans to come out to shows. Rockwood is definitely not helping this cause by putting extra cost commitments on attendees and making it difficult for them to enjoy the show they came out for.",https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8GwMpa259qoslxfUizrBrw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ux0I9WcT_yzvEJYYI7dVuw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/M4fl329aEP9z25Fa3TuP4Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HVzOUA1wiAneKGbIv4SiRQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/a8ZM_N_tGD6-EMAYcknh_g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GSoPibO-ya5zv-VmzsNvvw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KCBdr32SjB1fWxvl3z4Ggg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MeC3gSItiGgsaHRK7S1mqQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VgRrb5OKXZY6XAmdkr-SKg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/y3bY7VsUlvT4edFdo5gvQw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/paBvHh__fguqEURjI-6K9w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/R_D9QzprBdU6zCjdx4zLYA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qWgxX8UGUq0jJG4dIA9xMA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/13N9i91qhHRA6PEXGxK8aQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0a7ALY0tN9nXCV_O5svabA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3z7U0pRJfDNhPutj1lqZlg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jbkIfXJYk792n8qwqdl4Uw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yj4rCssmxAMOu82YYluhVg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/INXc9uRnchttfzE4IjoLIg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/utTC_C1Q7nPGr7Jxik9Zyw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tWzdwKi2-zy7Gdj_vi_U8w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Pt7qHJYqxtwYUDA8PJOp6Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZZEgzLdnsDIS0lb_rKq4vA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TYakNSI_FdqI8dtULa8akg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/sHZL6ClWSI-h1VuMiZvvCg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6dT0UIyx4RWWQf24nWCxXg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/85zoiccVF75k0KNj816A4w/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/root-and-bone-new-york,root-and-bone-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Southern,Comfort Food,Desserts,"My roommates and I came here for Restaurant Week and wow did we love it. Having all studied the menu ahead of time, we each knew exactly what we wanted to get (all chose the same items).The evening started off with complimentary biscuits which were soooo good. They came with this sauce that we weren't sure what was, but it was delicious with the biscuits (later looked it up and discovered it was meat juice- I think I'm glad I didn't know that's what it was). Next we each got the gem salad. which was very good. A little too salty for my liking, but still good. I loved the pickled onions on top.Next came the chicken and waffles and mac n cheese.. both were SO GOOD. The mac n cheese was so creamy and rich, and I loved the type of noodle they used for it. The chicken and waffles were also delicious, especially with adding syrup to them. I didn't love the addition of cheese on the waffles, though, because I felt the dish was enough without the cheese and also because we were given mac n cheese for the table. It didn't really detract from the taste enjoyment but it felt unnecessary to me. Beware- the chicken and waffles comes with A LOT of chicken. Better than the opposite, but I barely got through half of it. We gave our leftovers to a homeless man because we didn't want to eat fried chicken for another meal, so at least it didn't go uneaten.We finished with the key lime pie which was also very good, and wasn't too big of a serving (I have issues with self control and dessert.. then again, who doesn't). Our waitress was very attentive throughout. The atmosphere inside was also great- very cozy and quaint with cute decor everywhere. I'd recommend this spot to anyone for restaurant week or any time of the year! I'm sure the brunch is also delicious. For such a small space, the staff makes it work. They are accommodating, courteous, and impressively nimble. We got the chicken biscuits (sticky but so good), deviled eggs (truly an amuse bouche, bit expensive for 3 egg halves), the mac n cheese, and the key lime pie with two cocktails. Deviled eggs were decadent so I don't regret getting them, the true star of this meal was the mac n cheese. It came with buttery biscuit crumbs and scallions on top, gooey but also SO creamy. A heavenly texture experience, found myself closing my eyes while I chewed, heh. I loved that they brought hot sauce (maybe a honey hot sauce?) to the table, I covered most of the food with it! Key lime was cute because it was a mini and only $5, but a bit too sweet. Cocktails were great in that they were not very sugary, something I am really sick of in my recent bar outings. I'd say overall a little pricey, but to be expected. Quality made it worth it. I would probably avoid getting alcohol here again, $13 cocktail wasn't worth it for me but it looked like they have a pretty extensive whiskey collection, if you are into that. This is a fantastic place to come to if the weather outside is awful and you want some excellent southern comfort food. Came here on a random snowy/slushy Wednesday and we were pretty much the only ones in the place. Service was prompt and friendly. We ordered their biscuits and the mac &amp; cheese waffle to split between us. You haven't lived until you have tried their mac &amp; cheese waffle, it's perfectly cooked on the outside and warm and cheesy on the inside.  Their biscuits are magnificent as well. We also order the little blueberry cheesecake and key lime pie, both very rich in taste. They were both so sweet they could give you a cavity on their own, but well worth it. If you enjoy sweets, I'd highly recommend them. Southern food. NYC style. Forget how much this costs down where you're from. It's still good. Tasty in my mouth and filling my belly. If I had biscuits and gravy like this when I was in college I'd be in trouble. The biscuit itself is actually semi-sweet despite being covered in sausage-y gravy. The fried chicken is light and airy. I'm still not a chicken fan but I'll eat it fried. The breast is not as good as the leg. Gimme saturated fats any day over that healthy lean stuff...I'd come back and try some collard greens and shrimpy grits. Next time... Wow just wow, I have so many wonderful things to say about Root &amp; Bone. I have known about this place for a while but for some reason didn't decide to go here til today! I was in the area and saw it was close by so I was excited to try it based on all the delicious looking pictures on Yelp. From the moment I walked in, you smell all the different aromas of Mac and cheese, biscuits and fried chicken (which makes you even more hungry) The service was very good, all the waitstaff was very welcoming and ready to give any suggestion you might need on what to order. The decor was also really rustic and went well with all the food offerings. For the food: I ordered the Mac and cheese and the honey biscuits. Both were absolutely amazing. The mac and cheese was definitely made with sharp cheddar so you actually tasted the cheese well and it wasn't bland like most places! The biscuits were honestly amazing and it's bread so need I say more? JUST GO!!! My friend and I got two Mac and cheeses, Mac and cheese waffles and biscuits for 34 including tax so price point is great...and they take cards! Yay Service nice. Food not so. Fried chicken leg was cold. Waffles no flavors . Eggs were perfect but heavy sauce without salt or peppar, (added salt to finish). For the table were the best biscuits, delicious. The green salad was strange, with a bit green sauce that was a bit spicy (!!?). Deviled eggs were fine but very tiny , guess there's perfectly fine for an appetizer. Desserts were too sweet for us but ok if you like sweets. Also table were too small to fit all the food plates. Decorations were nice and cozy, felt it would suit a coffee shop more than a busy restaurant.I'd want to come back for biscuits but probably would be stared at, so I guess not coming back soon. Ugh, wrap me up in sticky buns, fried chicken, and drench me in biscuits and gravy. Sorry, gross visual but AMAZING food.Ok, I'm not your typical brunch gal. I don't really care to spend hours waiting for a table when I can be productive elsewhere. However, new year, new me... it's time that I allow myself to just go with the flow once in a while. On a chilly new year's day, I stopped by after a brief wait with the roomie and or friend. We had the sticky buns which were the best things to start and end our meal with. Biscuits and gravy which were sooooo good. Fried chicken &amp; three which we affectionally called ""fried chicken for three"" since there were 3 of us and it was just the perfect amount to share. And of course a nice salad to balance out the meal. And to drink? Kombucha spritz. HELLO! I love kombucha and I love that they made it into a fun little cocktail. If you're in for a cute and cozy brunch with some slightly heavy but oh so delicious filling food, this is your place. If Root &amp; Bone is in your bookmarks or you are in-between choices and this spot is one I suggest you come here... If you are with a group, grabbing a bit by your self or with your partner the seating arrangements can accommodate you. Window seating kitchen seating or bar seating, where ever you are you will catch a glimpse of the decorative concept used to make this place pop. Food hits the spot. I had fried chicken tiny waffles collard greens and Mac and cheese. Portions are perfect and the prices for the items on the menu could not be better. I'm looking forward to my next visit I'd rate Root &amp; Bone 4.5 stars. Root &amp; Bone has been on my brunch bucket list for awhile. I finally got to cross it off!We ordered sticky buns and ""Fried Chicken &amp;Three."" The sticky buns were gooey and topped with nuts. They were a bit too sweet for me (and I have a major sweet tooth) but enjoyable. Next up was the entree. The mac and cheese had a nice consistency--creamy on the bottom and breadcrumbs on the top. It was extra cheesy in the best way possible. The waffles were fresh but I wish they had a softer texture. The collard greens had a small kick of spice which livened up the flavor. The fried chicken was incredible--super juicy and the meat fell right off the bone.The server was friendly and checked in with us sufficiently. The place is a bit small so I wouldn't recommend coming with big parties. It's also a pretty popular place so to avoid a line I'd recommend coming during off-hours. This spot has been on my list for awhile, and I'm happy I finally got to try it! My friend and I made reservations for a weekday night, and it was still pretty crowded given it was a Wednesday, so reservations are highly recommended! The restaurant itself really isn't that big, tables are small and close together. We had made it just in time for Happy Hour, which was from 4-6PM. We got 2 chicken biscuits and drinks. The biscuits were juicy, filled with flavor, and a tad sweet from the honey. I wouldn't think I would love it as much as I did. In addition we got the Root &amp; Bone Fried Chicken, half bird to share, and a side of mac and cheese. The chicken was juicy, tender and flavorful. Though, I would've preferred if the skin were a bit more crunchy. The mac and cheese was addicting. Definitely very heavy, but sooooo good and creamy. Overall, the food was impressive. It was my first time trying a Southern fried chicken spot, and I will definitely be coming back for more! There were so many great reviews here so I came to try to food, but extremely disappointing and mediocre food. I ordered the chicken and three, which comes with two pieces of fried chicken and collard greens, waffles, and Mac n cheese. Firstly the fried chicken was flavorless and not crispy at all. The waffles did not stand out either. They tasted like those waffles you get at a continental breakfast buffet in a hotel. The collard greens were okay. It had very korean cuisine flavors to it which was unexpected. To be honest, the Mac and cheese was probably the best thing that I ordered. It was creamy, cheesy, and delicious, although a tad bit salty. The honey tobacco sauce and maple syrup were okay as well. The customer service is great and the interior is rustic and cozy, but the food was just ok. I will probably check out other restaurants if craving fried chicken. I was really impressed by the quality of benedicts they served. It was the best benedict I have ever had in the city. The bacon on the side was crispy and meaty at the same time. Also, with the eggs on top, the waffles tasted very soft and delicious. This is the must menu that everyone has to order!Because I knew this place was a pretty hot place, I picked such a random time to visit. (around 3pm) Thankfully, there was no line and so I did not have to wait at all. So... if you do not want to wait for a long time, I would recommend you to go to this place around<U+200B> 3pm or 4pm. It's everything as described and more. Cozy spot, outgoing and accommodating staff. Had supper with the Ladies, we feasted on the pre-fixed supper. Where do I start?Our Hostess,She greeted us with a warm engaging smile, and sat us at the most quaint delightful table. Our Waiter,A polite, friendly smile, which might I add fabulous eye candy! He did not rush us, explained the menu to us, and made sure our courses were paced, and we were happy campers. He also knew the menu intimately, which was a wonderful plus. The Food,Where could they go wrong, no where!  The biscuits - OMG, the Fried Chicken (""Smack Your Mama Good!"") The desserts - I'm a fan of the chocolate pudding. The People,Engaged with some of the most friendliest people in NYC.  The first table next to us was a couple, who offered for us to try their dish when we inquired as it looked so delicious. Btw, it was a grilled salad. Second couple next to us were visiting from out of town, and she said she smelled fried chicken in the air, and her nose lead her to Root and Bone. We recommended the Supper to them. Ambience,Yes, it is everything - simply put #FablousChic Root &amp; Bone is just wonderful for brunch. I was most shocked at the portion size for price point. I hope they change nothing about how they do business. Don't change the way your staff is approachable and full of patience, the tastiness of your food nor the price for which you offer it all for. I have nothing else to say. We came here at around 7.30 on a Saturday without a reservation. The wait to sit inside was about an hour so after some deliberation (it was a sub 60 evening) we agreed to sit outside rather than try to find somewhere else. In all honesty we probably didn't take full advantage of what was on offer (notably the chicken). But what we did have was really rather good and worth braving the mild outdoor temperatures. I opted for the shrimp and grits, which was really good but ultimately just shrimp and grits. My wife's pork dish was excellent, covered in some sort of green crumb and the meat fell apart easily. The outdoor seating is rather exposed but luckily it was a quiet side street. The seating in general is quite close together. I also found the service quite slow, which may or may not be to your liking. I would have preferred more options on the menu as well - due to allergies I only really had a choice between the shrimp and the chicken. I would probably go back if I could get a seat indoors - mainly to try the chicken but also some of the sides A cute and cozy spot for some delicious food! It's a very small and intimate restaurant so It seems like it can get crowded. I came at 2pm with a friend and luckily we didn't have to wait too long to be seated. You're basically sitting elbow to elbow with the tables next to you, so it's not really a great place for big parties and whatnot. We ordered the drunken deviled eggs, the half bird to share, buckwheat waffles and a side of Mac and cheese and collars greens. The drunken deviled eggs were pretty too look at and pretty good but I'm not really sure if it's worth it cause of its portion size. The eggs were a bit on the saltier side though. The buckwheat waffles were my favorite! I liked how fluffy and thick the waffles were! The Mac and cheese was delicious. It was crusted with biscuit and thyme on the top and complemented the Mac and cheese very well!  The chicken was moist and very flavorful. I loved how it was crunchy and crispy on the outside but still very juicy inside. Overall, would recommend this place but def would recommend making reservations or coming right before they close for dinner. I visited this restaurant during Restaurant Week with a few friends from work.Overall, the restaurant is pretty small but they make good use of the space that they have. The dcor was very homey and country kitchen styled. The mismatched dishes used also kept in line with the country homey feel. If you want to have dinner I definitely advise you to make reservations but they always seem to be crowded.To start for drinks we had the spiked peach ice tea which was very good but not apart of their usual menu from what I observed. Not too strong or weak. For appetizers we ordered the drunken deviled eggs which looked almost too pretty to eat and grandma daisy's angel biscuits. The eggs were pretty but we definitely eat every last one. The eggs were delicious but I definitely expected more of the biscuits. With a name like that I expected the biscuits to be the lightest and flakiest biscuits I had ever eaten but they weren't. The biscuits were good but I wouldn't order them again. My friends ordered the fried chicken while I had the meatloaf big mistake. In my opinion the meatloaf was a bit dry and I wouldn't order it again. Or maybe I felt that way because I did get to try the fried chicken. The fried chicken is definitely their specialty and a must try if you ever visit this restaurant. The chicken was very flavorful and fried to perfection. I loved the chicken so much that I neglected the food I ordered and placed an order for the fried chicken to go. It was even more flavorful the next day in my opinion. I would definitely return to this restaurant in the future but I will stick to their specialty dish next time. Probably one of my favorite restaurants in NYC. We ordered the the whole bird fried chicken, Mac n cheese, buckwheat cheddar waffles, succotash, and a whole lot of drinks.The fried chicken was cooked to perfection and I never would have thought I'd like buckwheat waffles but I loved them! Wonderful service and a really beautiful atmosphere in be restaurant. Came here, partly because really wanted chicken and waffles and partly due to all the good reviews.My review is based mainly on the food.  The place itself is cozy, not much else to really say.We ordered, the pickled deviled eggs...These were to die for.  Soooo very good.  Then of course we had to have the chicken and the waffles.We got the basket of the whole chicken.  Overall the chicken was very crisp and moist.  Perfectly seasoned.The waffles on the other hand, were not good at all.  I think they flash burned them.  When I took a bite into one of them, they completely crumbled.  For a chicken and waffle place this is what some would call an egg on the face.Now for the not so good part.  I might be picky but I like attention to detail.  In so many restaurants when they first open up, everything is looked over several times.  When they get popular, the little things start to go.Basically, when we got the chicken, the first thing I reached for, was a wing.  This particular wing was not quite fried and I ended up chewing on breaded skin.  The rest of the chicken was perfectly cooked.Another small thing to some, but I felt was lacking was the fact, that they didn't bring an empty bowl or something to put the bones in.  Imagine sitting a small table with a bucket of chicken and just one plate.  Not very fun.  This is what I call attention to detail.Overall, I would be back and the food was good.  I would however skip the waffles, and the drinks while good, a bit pricey. I really wanted to like this place, esp since my bf recommended Root &amp; Bone for their fried chicken but it just didn't live up to its hype. When we checked in the hostess said the wait would take anywhere between 1-1.5 hrs but the place looked pretty empty to us. We also were called in about 20mins later.. and when we got in there were at least 4-5 empty tables around us. The service today was pretty bad all around. We had to wait a while for our waitress to come pick up our card and check and because she took so long my bf walked up to the counter. The lady there asked if he could wait for our waitress to come to our table but we had already been waiting for a while. The food was also a tad disappointing. I expected the chicken to be crispy but it clearly was not. The flavor was there if you squeezed some lemon juice and dipped it in their Tabasco/honey sauce. We also ordered their biscuits and shrimp and grits. The biscuits were my favorite today but I wish they came out with the chicken, which I'm sure we could've asked for. The shrimp and grits looked and tasted more like scrambled eggs than grits.",https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CG-rI6U0_EC6ZbNfdlPn4g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/X7HIBWAzqI9LFRpVRc_Nyg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2JcocWge2I_m-WFOf0_grA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uWrHIlxsd71sltFQAY27RA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tYyD3HigJo1DxLyGPm_fRQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5f516gXhhyUbiKjJwpNIOw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/X81FWCvNOG9pB2azZp0MqA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/E7L4DjLY9CfyKdwZczm_gA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OIORG8c9Lt-m4_y_kn81aQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ywDf9FBvnX0-Ubgg3eEhEg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/chwqIpv0SWqhdEAA7BiLDA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kbIyWJKM6TMezIElrqjs8Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/i0T2LAr6CJbWy4IRf1Ojkw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/v2dBB29ZTSUvJt51LArQ6A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oVt5prqio6K1g4wv8kdoWA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/iYYXzfto_i2XW64j1ThmKg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DMJ38ahIOX-nupJcZv-5VA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KcRf4h90jlxH-VsB__m9Iw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/iLvs0QqSowpWuLmoWgn2mw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gmJD-xmkI1bPIbQHRHNQ9A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1AZc-qxdVUnvNEXXDE4naA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/d2z_5I8YZVOG4jz-KNtcPg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dgn3SjbjT4D67uRqT6S8OA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jJAC2iPW2ZGQZUoEMIuuUQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7xYl4QA6BQJawbMosT5evw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SokOHuPvMrOwNKBMGfkqmA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qf65FKT8OtP8z8PeBKKgEQ/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/round-k-new-york,round-k-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Coffee & Tea,Breakfast & Brunch,Bagels,"This place was very busy, plus it's very very tiny, but the outing is not hard to miss including the ""Round K"" flag it's cute. I'm not sure if he was the owner or not but the man making the drinks was very polite and very quick with making the orders. I ordered a matte black latte which includes: Coconut ash(why it's black), coffee, almond milk and the coconut ash whipped cream as well! It was delicious and very cool to look at. Small, Korean themed cafe!Really nice and cozy inside. They had many drinks (unique flavors) in their menu but we got americano and latte. You need to order up front, they bring it to you. Then you pat up front as you leave.Also the place wasnt noisy at all; very comfortable to sit and talk. They had outlets to plug in if you need to charge anything. There were Korean traditional decorations here and there, and it really added to the unique cute atmosphere.Coffee cups are very cute as you can see from the picture. Will come back! Egg yolk cappuccino!! One of the more interesting and delicious cappuccinos I've had.  This drink was creamy and delicious and I would come back for this again.  The two men sitting next to my friend and I saw our order as they were about to leave but decided to sit back down and order one to try.This shop has limited bar seating in the front but more table seating in the back.  It's a cozy place to relax, although I wish the area in the back was brighter.  They also offer astronaut brewed coffee, but for $50 I probably wouldn't try it unless I had disposable income to splurge. This place is sooo cute. It's such a shame it's only located in Chinatown. Overall rating: 5Coffee Presentation : 5/5Waitstaff: N/AAtmosphere: 5/5Bathroom: 5/5Food: N/ALoudness: quiet I came here on a Thursday night around 7pm. It started getting crowded around 7:30pm. When you walk in, there's a counter with the barista inside and 6 (?) stools on the outside. It seems cramped at first but behind the curtain, there's more seating! I think there were 7 tables. The little couch chairs can be moved around so you don't have to be all cramped and squished. We ordered the matte black latte which was such a delight to drink! You need to go up to the barista to place your order. The bathroom decor was so cute and the theme reminded me of the 1940s era. Best little hidden gem. I was actually walking down the street in search of something else for dessert, but I was immediately drawn into Round K by the strong coffee aroma (seriously, the coffee smell outside is intoxicating!!). Although the cafe looks tiny from the front, there are a few tables tucked away in the back where you'll find people working/studying or just chatting and chilling. The whole cafe gives off cool, hip vibes and has a sort of warm and cozy feel to it at the same time.Since they were all out of the black matte latte, I decided to order the mocha instead. It was rich, smooth and had just the perfect amount of sweetness, which is something I've found that a lot of other cafes struggle with. The drink also came out in a lovely drinking bowl and had the cutest bunny latte art on top! What a nice surprise. Love the ambiance and drinks here. Definitely will be back to try other drinks and food. Round K's entrance is so unassuming and average you'll walk past it a million times and not think twice or even inquire about it. Guilty. As. Charged.They have plugs and a cozy but very dim sitting area in the back - dim like Gryffindor's common room. It's perfect for work or for catching up with friends; I spent a solid 3 hours chatting away with a friend and it was perfect, though I wished the tables were bigger/taller because my 5'7"" frame kept hitting the table corners and plates! Drinks/The barista makes kawaii latte art like bear and rabbit if you ask him to (and they're served in the cutest tea party-ish floral cups)! We wanted to try the wasabi latte but it wasn't available that day. Food/All their eggs are made using the espresso machine! We ordered Mrs. Lee and Michelle's breakfast sets, each of which included a latte for an additional .50. Michelle's was lightly fragranced with truffle oil and my favorite of the two. Think American breakfast, but lighter and healthier versions.I'll definitely be back to try the egg cappuccino and the matte black ash latte! What a cute little cafe!  The cafe doesn't look like much from the outside or from the bar you're ordering from, but when you go past the bar you'll find the most quaint dining area.  A perfect spot for a coffee date or to hang out with your best friends for an afternoon pick-me-up.I came here from watching a video of an egg cappuccino.  It was intriguing and I'm all up for something new.  Once I got to the cafe, I did just that.  I ordered the egg cappuccino and was told to take a seat in the back.  There's a back?  What!  So I walk past the bar, through a curtained area, and found a hidden gem.  While waiting, I went to the bathroom to wash off subway germs and found the bathroom to be decorated in a traditional Korean house.  Exposed wood, decor based around tea, and a cute desk area that's purely decorative.  Being Korean, this was highly amusing. Once I returned to my seat, they brought out my beautiful cappuccino in a vintage looking tea cup.  The egg cappuccino is divine!  Its a little denser than the traditional cappuccino, and the egg white that is frothed into the milk gives it a meringue like consistency.  Its dusted generously with dark cocoa.  Definitely a sipping beverage.The seating is quite small and cozy.  Try not to bring a lot of stuff with you. Got the Egg Cappuccino,  pretty good but not hot enough. Doesn't taste the egg Yolk but taste good. I will try the Matte Black Latte next time. Relaxing, cosy and amazing coffeeshop!Hall in the wall, japanese style with super awesome tea cups.Love this place and it's not touristy at all! Great coffee shop tucked away in the lower East side. Don't by deceived by the appearance when you first walk in. Behind the curtain is hip cozy seating. We got a house coffee and a cafe latte to start. The cafe latte came with very cute foam art. The house coffee was delicious and when I asked for cream he came back with freshly steamed cream. All the dishes and cutlery we're beautiful. The attention to detail here is amazing. We ate the carb-less creation with avacodo and salmon, and an almond croissant which had been heated up. The eggs were so good. Seriously the best scrambled eggs I've ever had. They're made using the steam wand of the espresso machine and we're flavored excellently. The salmon as well had such a wonderful flavor. Be prepared it's salmon lox style. Just a great place to spend a cold day hiding away from the world. I did NOT have the ""egg cappuccino"" here. Egg cappuccino is Round K's specialty item, hearkening back to '70s Korea when dropping a raw egg yolk into your morning coffee was a super trendy health concoction. Think ""bulletproof coffee"" - we're all bored enough for the next revival fad, right?When I asked the guy behind the counter what ""egg cappuccino"" on the menu was, he flatly said ""just egg yolk mixed with the coffee"" with no recommendation whatsoever. That lack of endorsement is deterrent enough for me! I might try it in a country where chickens are not subjected to all manner of weird diets and dangerous living conditions and bacterial vulnerabilities. Not the US. Hello, salmonella.I DID have a regular latte here, which was too bitter and gritty and generally not made very well.The decor made up for it. Drinks are served in mismatched vintagey teacups, with tiny, flowery spoons. There's a secret feel to the cafe, since the petite booths are in a narrow space separated from the front counter by a heavy curtain. When I came by on a weekday evening, it was empty - perfect for relaxing, getting some reading done. Warning: table heights are uncomfortably low, so you probably won't stay too long.Cash only (edit 12/24/2017: per Yelp user Brady D, they now take card). Coffee prices are high - you're definitely paying for the ""hipster Korean"" aesthetic. Round K is a pretty cool spot centered around a pretty diverse menu option for a coffee shop. They got a few different types of tea and even some light foods. I couldn't give this place a full 5/5 because of the price and the portion. I had an iced tea, which was nothing like I expected. It felt like drinking a light syrup but it wasn't sweet at all, more like a grapefruit flavor. It was delicious and I could've had another cup or two, but for 3.50, and the cup being all of 10oz I wasn't about to do that. Same with the yogurt. It was great with a similar marmalade type of thing on top. It tasted good, and for 4.50, almost reasonable/ worth it. The cafe it self is really nice with a fair amount of seating. Although small seats themselves I think it'll make a decent hangout spot for a group of four or less. The staff is really nice though it's more of a ""I already know what I want"" kind of place. Asking for suggestions didn't get me anywhere. As a weekly regular Round K always returns the best cofee again and again. Their coffee's are all Americano based, espresso mixed with hot water, which is really the real deal, it always taste better than drip. They have a great vibe with brick walls, cool decor, and a cozy seating in the back. You can even pull up a chair in the front by the barista bar and hang out, draw, chat and sip. They also have some really unique Coffee drinks on their menu that are awesome, check them out! Cute, hipster, and small cafe. After you pass through the bar area at the front, there is a small room with very small tables and chairs. Most of the seating areas have an outlet nearby, but since there are so little options, it's hard to get a table! The restroom is quite large, so that's a plus. The employees are friendly! I had two drinks while I stayed here working on some stuff:Matte black latte - pretty sweet, but I enjoyed this drink. Not a huge fan of the charcoal texture left on my tongue, but I do like that you can still taste some coffee.Cortado - quite strong! I definitely had to put a bit of sugar in this. Great coffee in this little hole in the wall spot in LES. They have Oatly oatmilk which already puts them above other coffee shops IMO! My oatmilk latte was creamy and delicious. It was ~$4. The shop is really really tiny and doesn't have much seating. It has a tiki bar kinda vibe. Really unique spot to grab a cuppa to go. My latte had some cute latte art on it ! Skip the wait at Russ &amp; Daughters and walk into this sweet spot for personalized service, great coffee and espresso drinks and a creative Korean inspired breakfast.FYI: they roast their own coffee and it's pretty darn good. What a cute little cafe!  This cafe is off the beaten path, and I'm so glad it's still a hidden gem!  The cafe has a hipster vibe, and the workers are so friendly.  You order at the counter, and the workers will bring your drink over to your table.  The seating area is quiet, but not too much so that you can't have a conversation.  You'll see some customers chatting away while others are getting work done on their laptops.You must order their matte black latte ($6.50)!  It is made with charcoal, which is a good cleanser and has some ice cream in it which makes it a bit heavy.  But it is a good treat once in awhile!  I also heard good things about the egg cappuccino, which I must try next time! Delicious coffee, cool ambiance, unique selections and very friendly barista and staff. Came here after watching an insider video, was not expecting what we did. The aroma of the coffee was amazing once you step foot in the shop. It was a bit confusing when you first stepped in because it seemed like only bar seating but behind a small curtain to the back was small cozy seating. When I say small, I really mean small. The seats were tight. Their set up for 4 but honestly from standard American size it's a little more than a single seat. 4 would be tight unless you're super skinny. We order the egg cappuccino and the matte black latte. Expecting to see the egg yolk like in the video but I guess it was already blended in to the cappuccino itself unlike the video. The flavor was strong with a bit of smokines which I loved and you can really taste the creaminess of the egg.  The matte black latte was amazing. A little sweet with the rich bold flavors of coffee but what topped it over was the black cream that topped the latte. It tasted almost like ice cream! I highly recommend this place. Will be coming back to try the other selections and possibly brunch one day. A darling little coffee shop, hidden away in a non populated area of Chinatown.I walked in and felt like I was in the 1920's of Korea. Lots of Korean decor with swingers jazz playing. All cups they use are fun florals, non of which match. I felt like I was in an adult tea party!!Only negative thing is their seats are awfully small and uncomfortable for a coffee shop. My butt barely fit and I had to contort myself to get comfortable enough to read",https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oq3jv-hvgCp_E7SCABhI7Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/azRwOLV1f9NIcGZZMjJ2cw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qJTxW2xUfiTJ_ya2qswafw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-SwzpUcYfbR3RC5Ks6xvtw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/M6PqkQAmqXIPolEORj9kmg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EBYyQC7HDgwKRh0tnGMqYA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IMVhaZJBT8ep9J2GgwfSPw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VOfeDnkmqiHWc6qqGVJEAg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/w6_Df2c79v-3lWyKf-K3vQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Oef1YuQZLOzfjfZ4GBXH5w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IpFW5WTbxZWcmtxNOw5brA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/64d11CZNWWPzCMEcrCMqVg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TMPuXo0u2Pt3ZHazkiFkPQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/epDokhHKcDtYB0F6T3HSeQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bCEQJA9SCDjrKQrB8hzSyA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JpjKJmJ34Z6B38eSG7WT0w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CNQY4RsQpfadAk7eHlmKSw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HnPS-AXnqocEAHtmkGTYlA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WFSp5B3SEpwcRfSfZLjRAg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/g4a1VpfZuwJwuk0M_rQlTQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Q9rskA00NY0f8e-33SbWJA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EGgjNqT7_HF6uBubE_CHxw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/T4OWE0RtvXfsU8WFqb1IEw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Hs6KUg9JQS6hfg__97PlnQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/A9t-RYia4xKoL-1W3_WGew/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ifSZbZBFxOA31DcBT9nPNg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DHUDdj64sHbvA9JsAUn_HQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2hzhgf9L0VraUiGaWJ_F7Q/258s.jpg,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/rubirosa-new-york-2,rubirosa-new-york-2,New York,10002,NY,Italian,Pizza,NA,"OMG I can't believe i hadn't written a review for this place until now!!Ive been here like maybe 5 times...its in the list of italian restaurants in the city I love for their pizza and pasta!The tie die pizza is to die for!! Its got pesto, mozzarella , vodka sauce and its amazing!The pasta's are good too...The last time we had the ricotta Ravioli..was yummy..tons of other places in the city for good pasta...but you must have the pizza..Obviously going back!! The Tie-Dye pie was both simple and satisfying. With vodka sauce, tomato, pesto, and fresh mozzarella, you can't help but sink into the comfort of your own seat while taking in this delicious pie. The pesto gave the pie a very earthy and freshflavor. The mozzarella was layered on very thin, but the reason you are ordering this pie in the first place is because of that vodka sauce. It may be the best I've ever had. If I were to make a recommendationget the Tie-Dye - the combination of the vodka sauce and pesto is on point. I'd recommend getting some meat on it as wellTo continue reading review, go here:Check out my post!https://www.apizzanewyork.com/single-post/2018/01/25/Rubirosa-Ristorante-Nolita During my short stay in NY, I attempted to eat a slice of NY pizza every day. I ate Joe's twice and thought that was pretty good. On my last day before heading home, I had some time to kill and happened to be in Soho. I realized that Rubirosa was in Soho. Mikey Chen from Youtube's Strictly Dumpling said this was his #1 spot for NY pizza. I knew it was fate that I was near it on my last day.I got there a little before opening time, which was 11:30. My sis and I put in an order for two vodka slices to go. We had to wait about 20 minutes because they were just firing up the oven and hadn't started on the pizzas. No worries.Anyways, the two slices were $7-something together. It was scorching hot and my sister wanted to go to Doughnut Plant, so I held my precious baby protectively through the rain and dirty subway. While my sister was eating her donut, I took a bite into my slice. I was really, really, really happy because it did not disappoint. I declared it the best slice I've had in my life. The pizza itself it so thin and crisp. I love that it is so saucy. I mean, you can see the sauce throughout the whole slice. The chunks of melted cheese dispersed throughout the slice was perfect. Writing about my slice at work right now brings back fond memories... almost have tears in my eyes.The vodka sauce was out of this world. It was so flavorful and tomato-ey and a little sweet. Loved it!! When I go back to NY, I'm going to try to eat here every day.Give the vodka slice a try, everyone! Came here with a friend for a late lunch on a Saturday and was pleasantly surprised that we were seated right away, after hearing about the wait time. The restaurant crowd did die down by 2pm. We decided to get the smaller pizza (half Rubirosa Supreme and half Arugula) ~$21 and family size Tajarin alla Carbonara pasta $28. Their whole pizzas and pastas come in two sizes. Their pizzas are super thin and crispy- the way I like it. I liked the Rubirosa Supreme (meat) better than the Arugula, but both were good. The carbonara pasta came with egg yolk on top and had a good amount of richness and subtle flavor. My friend and I came in very hungry and out super full, so I would say one smaller size pizza and a family-size pasta could even feed some groups of 3. OMG the two R's - Roberta's and Rubirosa have my pizza heart.  We made reservations about a month in advance because, just a side note: if you walk in without a reservation and they tell you the wait is going to be 3 hours, then it truly is 3 hours.  We have tried this multiple times only to have been at home in bed already by the time we got the text that our table was ready. So anyways, on to the good stuff. WHAT WE ORDERED: - Half Tie-dye, half supreme - GET THIS! For 2 people, this and a pasta/appetizer is a good amount of food.  The vodka sauce is TDF. - carbonara pasta - GET THIS! all pastas are made in-house.  TRUST ME, there is a difference! - Rubirosa salad - perfect starter to the meal. Especially if you love arugula. We will be back! I had not tried Rubirosa since I moved to NYC 8 years ago and I am filled with regret, because the pizza here is MEMORABLY great. New York obviously has so many great pizzas, but Rubirosa's pizza was amazing, definitely worthy of the ""best"" pizza category. It is a thinner crust, super crisp, and stays crisp (I hate when the middle of the pizza gets soggy and drippy). I had the tie-dye which is a must. Topped with cheese and no extra toppings to get in the way, it highlights the amazing tomato sauce. I also had the Rubirosa supreme with perfect lil pepperonis. I would have a hard time choosing my favorite between the tie die and the supreme (get both). The third pie was a mushroom, good but didn't have that wow factor (I'm partial to red sauce). Start with mozzarella sticks - we all love them even if we're too embarrassed to order them because we are ""adults now"" but no one ever regrets ordering them. Rigatoni was a good mini break from the pizza, and we also ordered a pasta special with 4 kinds of meat (super meaty but delicious). The pastas alone might be worth going back for.Basically, if you haven't been to Rubirosa yet then do it ASAP. Reservations are near impossible to come by, but make them way in advance if you can. Tie-dye pizza and anything with red sauce is a must, but don't sleep on their pastas either. This is ultimate classic Italian spot for great food with great people. Love love love Rubirosa! Major tip: use the app RESY to make a reservation!! It is a major lifesaver. There are a couple times i came here without a reservation and the wait was 90 mins or more. Sure i can get a drink next door but when i want my Rubirosa, i want It when i walk in! Hehe :) Rubirosa is a cozy Italian spot in Nolita. It's dimly lit inside and has a full bar, which might be great for a little date night. We came late at night and it was still pretty crowded. The prices aren't that bad and the service was quick and friendly. If you're stuck deciding between 2 different pizzas, they can do split pizzas. We opted for half of the fresca and half of the Rubirosa supreme. The crust and pizza dough was as you would expect, thin but very crispy. I'm not a huge fan of the crispy crust and would prefer the crust be a little doughier. The toppings on the pizza were plentiful and I loved the fresh mozzarella. Rubirosa is a great spot for pizza, offering a nice ambiance and good pizza. When my friends ask me where they can find the best pizza in NYC, I say Rubirosa. After watching Strictly Dumpling's youtube video of his picks for best pizza spots in NYC, I knew I had to try this place.For $28 you can get a half and half large pizza. We got half Supreme (tomato, mozzarella, pepperoni, mini meatball, roasted garlic) and half Tie-Dye (vodka, tomato, pesto, fresh mozzarella). Tie-Dye was definitely the star here and is hands down the best thin-crust pizza ever. I never craved pizza before until I had this! It was love at first bite and I didn't want it to end...The wait can be pretty bad if you don't have reservations (1-2 hours). They also do to-go orders which I might do next time. However, there's just something special about eating pizza right out of the oven here. I'd recommend dining in if it's your first time. Was visiting the neighborhood and heard of their crispy pizza crust and wanting to go for the experience.  Walked into a dim and bar like atmosphere.   A bit of a surprised as I discovered it as a bar/restaurant servicing up more than just pizza fitting into many occasions from casual pizza lunch and brunch place to a fancy date or business ocassions. We were there for a casual lunch with our kids.  We ordered the half vodka and half original with pepperoni.  I left in love with their vodka pizza and their crispy and thin crust.  Its the crispiest and thinnest crust I have ever encountered as I am a big fan of. The half pepperoni pizza were least as crispy and was salty and greasy from the pepperoni.  Both kids approved both as each consumed both.Very nice staff as they persist in coming to us with assistance and attentive to our needs.  Almost given a 5 stars if i only their seatings were more comfortable and welcoming.  For a party of 4,  we find there being cramped in space as my hubby was constantly being bumped by the staffs having to move to and from the bar area.   I would definitely back to try their Italian entrees and different style pizzas as we left in love with their style pizza. Pizza in NYC, can it really ever be that bad? From the dollar slices to your gourmet establishments, NYC will hardly disappoint for a slice of heavenly carby goodness. I must admit, a bit skeptical on a place like this with wait times comparable to an amusement park ride, but Rubirosa did not disappoint, although unsure if I'd ever want to wait that long for pizza. I was fortunate enough to get a seating for 2 at the bar quickly and didn't have to suffer the agony that many others did, especially on a blistering cold night. The place is your typical Nolita trendy spot with the hip vibe, cute but close confined dining, and a sometimes pretentious atmosphere. Wait time not being an issue for my experience, so I'll get to it. The pizza is pretty special. The crust is extremely thin but crispy throughout yet really light. Think of a cracker or even motzah. The sauce...is crack infused bursting with flavored meth crystals. Put that sauce on a flip flop and you'll be convinced flip flops are delicious and should be the next novelty item at smorgasburg. Add some fresh ingredients and you got yourself an excellent disk of heaven. I love pizza so maybe I'm easy to please, but I do know good pizza and they just do the humble pie justice here. Lesbehonest, I will definitely not wait for hours for this, but that's just me, only because there are other phenomenal pizza spots without the wait. But if I had the opportunity to swoop in without too long of a wait again, I'd gladly come back and get lost in the flavors, flavors that make me want to do weird things to that pie that I can not speak of...Stay fat mother suckers BEST PIZZA IN THE WORLD HANDS DOWN.Came here on a recommendation from Strictly Dumpling and I'm SO glad we did. Writing this review as I'm in the restaurant because seriously I can't wait for everyone to try this place. MUST TRY: half tie dye, half supreme. The supreme was a little meat heavy for me but my male friends LOVED it. It truly is a meat lover's paradise. I personally really enjoyed the tie dye, the pesto is on point. The crust of these pizzas are so thin and unlike anything I've ever tried. I have nothing but good things to say about Rubirosa pizzas! A large pizza was perfect for 3 people, we were all full at the end but not over stuffed. The service here was good and the vibes are great here. This is definitely a gem in lower Manhattan and I can't wait to come back! Of all the food I ate in NY, this was probably my favourite spot. Oh and don't be afraid of the hour wait, it goes by quicker than you think. In my opinion, one of the most absolutely essential NYC restaurants. Some of the best pizza in the city, plus great pastas and other dishes. Last visit, we went with a group of four and got rice balls to start, followed by three small pastas (carbonara, cavatelli with broccoli rabe / sausage / garlic / oil, and a special tagliatelle with pork sugo) and two small pizzas (a vodka and a half Rubirosa Supreme / half Tie-Dye). Everything was excellent as always. The cavatelli was the group's favorite pasta, although I liked the sugo as much or more. (Don't think we'd get the carbonara again.) The pizzas are what I go for, though, and they didn't disappoint -- if there was anything I'd do differently, it might be to get a full tie-dye and skip the supreme, although the supreme is still great.Overall, just an incredibly good spot that is extremely hard to get into and so worth it when you do. Four stars only because the food took about an hour to come out. I tried the Brussels sprouts, they were a little charred but it was good. It probably would have been yummier if it didn't have burnt pieces but I was too hungry to send it back. I tried the vodka pizza &amp; that was delicious. Thin crust. Service is also great. Staff is friendly. Definetly will eat here again when I'm in New York. OKAY FINE. Despite a particularly unpleasant experience with a wine bottle mixup at the bar, the food was just so phenomenal that I'm still rating it 4 stars. Like, let's put it this way - it was a miserably cold and rainy Sunday and my friend and I were in inexplicably atrocious moods and we left this place feeling like whole new humans thanks to how amazing the food was. I've been trying to come here for a while, but the wait's always somewhere in the ballpark of 2-3 hours and I've never been able to plan far enough ahead where I can kill that much time in the area waiting for a table. It was the Sunday after Halloween and the city was pretty dead on a Sunday night, so we decided we'd take a stab at it one more time. Sure enough, the wait was totally reasonable - maybe around 45 minutes or so, so we decided to stick it out.They asked us if we were willing to take bar seats and we didn't have a problem with that so we were able to be seated sooner. The bartender was friendly and helpful with recommendations - he suggested we split the calamari to start and we were SO glad we did - the portion size was huge and it was breaded/fried perfectly - crispy yet light, delicious with lemon, and served with an amazing marinara, of which we were given plenty yet still finished. We ordered a half and half large which was around $28 I believe. We got half of the Supreme (i believe thats what it was - basically a bunch of meats) and the tie-dye (pesto and vodka). The pizza was fairly thin but wasn't too crispy/burnt - both halves were delicious although I think I liked the tie-dye slightly more. It's also nice that you can opt to pick two different choices because everything on the menu sounded great so it would have been too tough to pick just one! We were stuffed when we finished eating although the pizza wasn't as filling as I was expecting - two girls split a large without bursting afterwards.Now on to the one negative: we ordered a different bottle of wine than the one we were given, which was at a higher price point. This has happened to me before and apparently is relatively common practice at restaurants, which bothers me because I feel like at least in some cases it's done intentionally. I guess I'll give Rubirosa the benefit of the doubt in this case, but I'll for sure be careful to check labels more intently when I return. TL;DR: phenomenal phenomenal food. Plan ahead with your wait or book a table because otherwise it's usually brutal, but worth it! I was in NYC for a couple of days and my friends took me to Rubirosa for lunch, and now it's a must visit every time I'm in the city...Service:  Excellent service from beginning to end. Our server was friendly and great with suggestions when we narrowed our picks down to two choices.  There was another server who kept our water carafe full and was also filling our glasses whenever he stopped by.  A manager checked up on as well at the end.  This made for a great lunch.Italian food: EVERYTHING we ate, was on point.  Here are my All Stars:  The mini-rice balls were very tasty, that Fontina cheese, so so good. I just wish there was more than 4 per order. hehe  The Calamari though, was not only was tasty but came out on a huge serving plate. We couldn't even finish it.  The Tajarin alla Carbonara was fantastic, the egg really brings it home.   The Tie-Dye pizza was amazing.  The mozzarella cheese, marinara, vodka and pesto sauces made for probably the best thin crust I've had this year.  Everything we tried was made with high quality ingredients and prepped extremely well.  Italian food game is on point here!Ambiance:  As soon as you walk in, you're greeted by a ull service bar to your right and the hostess stand to the left.  Wooden floors, tables and old school Italian decorations definitely gives that family run Italian-American run restaurant vibe.  Just like most Manhattan restaurants, there's not a lot of space so get ready for a very intimate dining experience but not a claustrophobic one.Pricing is your typical Manhattan restaurant for quality meals.  If you're hungry the bill can add up quickly, but this is a GREAT restaurant to be hungry af at.  I enjoyed everything we tried.  I guarantee this is not my last visit here.  Until next time Rubirosa! My friend and I came here after we wanted to replicate Mike Chen's pizza tour video and try out some of NY's best pizza places. We arrived at around 2 on a weekday afternoon and there really wasn't much of a wait. We were seated toward the back of the restaurant by the oven and it was pretty warm and toasty back there.Judging from the pictures and the tips from my fellow Yelpers, my friend and I decided to go with the large vodka pie to split amongst us two. The pie took a while to prepare, but we were both satisfied upon tasting it. The pie wasn't oily at all, being that it's a thin crusted pizza. The sauce was sweet and somewhat tangy and the mozzarella complemented everything else well. The crust was crunchy and had bit of char to add a little nice bitterness to the pizza itself. Overall, I agree with Mike Chen on Rubirosa being one of the better pizza places in NYC. The pricing for one large vodka pie was fair, they also offered other Italian dishes including pasta. The service was impeccable and the venue was clean. Will definitely be returning and will recommend this place to others! Pizza is tasty and I like their use of pesto - think this is an under-rated topping. Tie die and vodka are my favorites. Some pies are a tad too crispy and thin in the crust for me but delicious none the less. Overall quality pizza. There's a TON of artisanal pizza options in NYC, but this ranks right up there with the best of them. Definitely be prepared for a bit of a wait, but there's a good reason people are lined up on the block. As is the dilemma with most dining experiences, it's difficult to choose what to get, so if I had to recommend one thing, it would be the vodka and pesto pie - very unique and so delicious. Usually I'm a big topping person but the blend of sauces with the right amount of cheese and an ultra thin but crisp crust makes this just perfect as is. I came here last night with my parents who are visiting from out of town. Was super excited to take them to one of my favorite places for pizza. As expected the pizza was AMMAZING and pasta was too! Unfortunately, I felt the need to update my review and dock a star because the overall service was lacking and dampened the mood a little. First off, I made reservations more than a month in advance and when we arrived we got stuck in a dark corner table right by the bathroom. I can appreciate that the hostess only has so much control over table available so it didn't end up being a huge deal, but a little disappointing. Second, and most errking, were our waitresses (we had two because one was covering for the other during a break). One was very snooty and made me feel bad/awkward when I asked for a wine recommendation. I know ZERO about wine and was hoping to get some help. She stared at me and nearly rolled her eyes as if it was an inconvenience for her to just offer up a suggestion. I want to keep coming here but amazing food doesn't excuse poor service. Hoping it was a one off.",https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZXGCJNOL71y8x8eMI0zzjA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NsJWAY5IVP_qPIaASAU_gg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OJGjehxsmb_lsxvDLg5ISQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WAxvh_950QAHT5ndqz7IYg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MFfTWVgXceRM1qONQPSXbQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_8pA8KYeE3Sn4xB62wzP-w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oMNMFm4b_1Ibr6bM-dt9LQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/sUIUmt10LAmAZeJ4bCz84w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gq3y_YOgtcX2iz6W_KnBEg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rIKOvqBYnsi1r_ICMzU2bA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TUDVTGdGQ1PllXRa51kEcg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kmBjvz_CggZfkq9JSG-6hg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yVMY3vTgTdihIPEwn7NFwg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WsKr36b-M3jFjj02TQ39ZA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/em-bxLd4b_CAX7TjQrIaSA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/P30fKSYROYSXkHKcNRgeLg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nLaCqHEitK7GkDXoocGlNg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MDjksVo-W-JEQJgofCLpSQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OD_-NJ5SD_JGDqZLhb3ImQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/H1oNu026fn9FRzJn2nND3Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pyMI3jVMakDlm2YWaZFfSw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kEceyIFm8J6h_y5mXqA6Wg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4eDyRUHWToh3rycUrOYZrA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DdieH8I12Evzoyd7WZM5Kw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ndzTgjCJaE0xbBKcoTA3bA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CiYcT1rTwjE0hmTFC_gthw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/H8Xxdnl0k3gjcBXooh1NWg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/O7w00sP98FKPmRwgKbG8-g/258s.jpg,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/rubys-cafe-new-york-2,rubys-cafe-new-york-2,New York,10002,NY,Burgers,Coffee & Tea,Breakfast & Brunch,"Ruby's Cafe has always been my go-to place to grab a bite. I never wrote a review for them in the past but I've been coming here since they first opened. Now, this place has been a popular restaurant. I loved the variety of food they serve from salads to pastas to burgers. The prices are also moderate, pretty inexpensive for NYC. Yes, it is a small sit down restaurant. I've always had to sit intimately with the table next to us whenever I dined with one person. I recently came here on a Tuesday night with a group of 7 people. They told us the wait was about 30 minutes, which wasn't bad for a group at a small restaurant. We received a text saying our table was ready after only a 10 minute wait. I JUST found out that they had expanded, so there's a part of the restaurant one store front down. I thought that was a little weird but hey, it's more seating and less waiting. The negative thing about the expansion was that there was no restroom on the new side of Ruby's. Our waitress was attentive and friendly while she was taking our orders. I had the Whaley's burger with fries (I typically order this when I'm here). The burger was cooked exactly the way I wanted it. I love how they use panini-like bread instead of hamburger buns. There's also a sweet taste (I think it's the pineapple) that balances out the beef. The fries with aioli sauce was so good, I couldn't stop eating them even though I was full. I haven't been here for awhile, they still have not failed at keeping me satisfied! Avoided the long wait during Sunday brunch! Lucky me because the Bronte burger was just what I needed after a month hiatus from Eggs Benedict, avocado toast, acai bowls...your typical brunch foods. But this burger is not so typical. I think what makes it so delicious is the sauce they add to it. Get this on a rainy day and you'll walk out happy. Get a side of seasoned fries with it and your palette is complete. Would definitely come back to try the rest of the menu. Or to simply enjoy the JT, Britney, and Jesse McCartney throwbacks (my review is more biased bc of the music)!! <U+200B>It's been a few years since I've been here and I remember it being really small--holding no more than ~20 people--it was cash only, no reservations and generally a wait. Oh, and the food was really good. I've had everything from burgers, to pasta to sides a few years ago.Fast forward to today.I was meeting a friend for lunch at 1pm and there were a ton of people already waiting outside. Fine. The guy inside said it would only be 15 minutes so we ended up waiting in her car right outside the restaurant. NBD.15 minutes later, I checked in w/ the host and we were seated immediately. So Ruby's has expanded and they also took over the place next door. CON: there is no bathroom there. You have to walk outside, next door to the original establishment to use the restroom. This alone was a MAJOR turn-off. It was a high of 23F today. My friend is also preggos so she had to walk next door a few times.On to the food. I got the Shrimp Avocado. In theory, it sounds delicious and I think it would've been good if the lettuce wasn't yellow, a bit bitter and old. There was also nothing spectacular about the shrimp. It was a little overcooked w/ no seasoning.We split the sweet potato fries which is topped with sour cream and sweet chili(?). This was good. I'd give it a 7/10.SUPER unimpressed by this place as it's gone way downhill.On a more positive note, if you do decide to go, they now take credit cards. But they still don't take reservations. Honestly quite not sure why this place is so popular especially among international tourist. My friend visited NYC from Korea wanted to check this place out. We stopped by the Ruby's Cafe at around 3 pm to avoid the crowds, but even at 3pm there was a long wait list. Because of my friend's ambition to try this place out, we decided to put our names and phone number at the waiting list. After a long wait, we finally got seated, but we didn't have the most pleasant experience as the lady who seated us rolled her eyes when my friend was tying his shoe lace, tossed the menu at a table and just walked away. Ruby's Cafe is a very small cafe where there aren't that many free spaces. Because everything is so narrow - including the hallway, the server will barely check up on you, and the servers make minimum interaction with the customers. I had to get an extra napkin because my hands were getting dirty from the burgers, and despite the numerous attempts to make an eye contact with the servers, I didn't get a chance to even ask for one. We ordered a  and ordered the Bronte Burger, and a Shrimp Pasta. The foods were good. But I'm not sure whether it's worth a +40 minutes wait considering the unpleasant experience due to a bad customer service. My friend and I went last night, it was pretty nice. There are apparently two places where you can eat. We went into the first section and thought it was pretty small. But the other section (which was two doors down) had about one group in it. So, if you feel like it looks to crowded ask if you can be seated next door. Food-Loved my meal- I got the crunchy grain bowl for 13 dollars! It was really good and fresh, I would recommend this healthy choice. Service- The workers were nice and attentive! Would go back again, especially for their brunch! Ruby's is a super cozy and trendy place that's perfect for bringing a hot date or a few close friends to. It is an Australian influenced cafe offering a variety of pastas, burgers, and salads. I thought it was fun how their burgers are named after beaches in Australia. Some burgers even include sweet chili, sliced beets, and/or pineapple which are all common staples in the country.On my visit, I ordered the pesto pasta. This dish consisted of spaghetti, pesto sauce, and chicken (or veggies if you're looking for a meatless alternative). It was the perfect amount of creaminess, full of flavor, and really delicious! I really enjoyed this dish and thought it was just the right portion size so I didn't pass out from carb overload. I tried a few bites of the Bronte burger and thought it was a solid choice as well.Definitely come here if you're in the area! They don't take reservations but it was only a 10-15 minute wait when I came on a weekday night. I already know I'll be coming back since there's so many other menu items I still want to try. Very cute small spot on Mulberry street in Manhattan. There's actually 2 rooms next to each other with 2 separate entrances. Open kitchen. They serve breakfast but ends early. Had lunch. I had lamb Ragu. Very delicious. A fettuccine type pasta with shredded lamb, very soft with tomato sauce. The other person had Rag Bol - spaghetti Bolognese with peppers and zucchini. The dishes came out very quickly. Excellent service. Demerit for no decaf coffee!!!!!!!' It was too late for me to drink caffeinated One of my favorite places in New York! The chicken pasta is amazing and never fails. The fries are an obsession. The burgers are great. My girl friend also really enjoys their pesto pasta. Also workers are super friendly and have a ""cool"" vibe. THE BRONTE BURGER::heart heart heart heart heart heart::yes, this counts as a reviewi am so depressed they don't have this in LAbut i'm on a mission to recreate itcurrently on batch #3 Casual brunch/lunch cafe with limited seating but lots of great offerings of pasta, burgers, salad. I've visited Ruby's twice and loved both visits. They expanded the store to additional seating next door, so make sure you ask about the wait! *Pumpkin Seed Pesto Chicken Pasta: DELICIOUS!! The pesto sauce was perfectly seasoned and you can taste hints of the pumpkin seed. The grilled chicken was very tender and was cooked well too. It is a creamier sauce but the nutty pesto flavor balances out the creaminess. Definitely recommend this one! *Spicy Rag Bol: Another success. Nice little kick of spice to the bolognese sauce. Sauce is quite hearty but can get heavy if you are just eating the pasta. We shared the pasta with the burger, so it was great. *Bronte Burger: I will clear things up and say this is not your typical burger. The bread is like a panini style and no typical lettuce, tomato on these. But instead, you get the spicy chili sauce that complements the patty so so well. The patty is very juicy and cooked well. -Whaley's Burger: meh on this one. I wasn't a big fan of the combo of sweetness from beet and pineapple with the savory flavor from the patty. The fried egg also doesnt really add too much flavor so was confused about the overall concept of this burger. Best for parties of 2-4 but could accommodate bigger parties if you come at off peak times. Come early on weekend brunches because Ruby's is a popular spot! Hands down, one of my go to restaurants in LES if I'm craving for pasta, burgers or fries.  Cute spot a little off Soho, but it is always packed so be prepared for a wait if you go for dinner or brunch.  I've been for both and I enjoy that they offer regular menu items during brunch time because the shrimp linguine pasta is just simply amazing.  It's super creamy without being overbearing and has just enough flavor.  Their famous Bronte burger is melt in your mouth good!! One of my favorite burgers in the city if I might say.And the fries with truffle aoli - must get, they've got these fries down to the T. Cute spot for date night or brunch if you don't mind the wait. Ruby's Cafe offers a wide variety of brunch items from your traditional breakfast food items, to delicious salads, to your standard burger and fries.  One thing that I appreciate about Ruby's is their variety of gluten free options.  While I did not try it, they offer gluten free buns for their burgers and sammies, and also gluten free pasta options. I will certainly have to come back and try it!As for what I did try...well it was delicious.  I ordered the crispy rice bowl filled with radish, scallions, cucumber, tomato, onion, cucumber, fried egg and haloumi cheese.  Because I was feeling bougie, I added avocado to my bowl. The rice was exactly what it is described as: crispy and delicious.  Think crunchy rice that almost tastes like it's been fried. To be honest, it could have been. And that would make sense given it's deliciousness.The ingredients were fresh and melted together nicely to create a celebration of flavors for my tastebuds.  As any other millennial would, I ordered the $7 fresh juice that came with freshly blended pineapple and mint for a refreshing and light drink that paired well with my bowl.The ambience is hip and trendy-with open walls that overlook the streets of Soho, allowing for the fresh, crisp, fall air to blow through your hair as you enjoy your meal.  Service was fast, friendly and the vibes were chill.  It was pretty busy and there was about a 25 minute wait for a table of two on a Sunday at 1pm.  Overall, if you're into the brunch scene, are gluten free (or not), you should definitely consider coming here! Ruby's Caf! Ahh what can I say. I'm speechless honestly. I love this place so much (seriously, I do--if you're ever reading this, like I am like most--H U G E FAN!).I love love love the creamy chicken pasta, it's soooo good. The last time I came here was probably a month ago--so sad. I would love to go every weekend if I can. But as usual--service is always on point here and so is the food. What I would recommend is definitely the creamy chicken pasta, the rag bol, and chicken burger. I really like the chicken burger since it's buttermilk marinated chicken mmm. The  Bronte is also very good so that's also something you may want to consider--there's sweet chilli in it by the way. Creamy polenta is also very good for breakfast if you're into that (cause I know I am).Honestly, everything is good so whatever. Go crazy, have fun. Eat. I'm just completely speechless because it's so great. Kay, bye. Forever Ruby's Caf lover. Besides the long wait this place is mad good!! Love love the truffle fries and the burgers is to die for ;D I believe the Kpop star snsd/girls generation also enjoyed this place as well. Honestly it's great for brunch, lunch, dinner or anytime. The service is great and the food is amazing. Even a simple salad is unique and delicious.One uncomfortable thing would be that it's a small, popular place. I was lucky enough to get a table right away but I would be cautious.Otherwise strongly suggested for everyone. Ruby's has been around for many many years now.  This is still my favourite place to get an Australian burger with the lot done right!  Definitely worth a visit if you feel like a casual bite to eat. Came back a second time to try their spicy seafood spaghetti and must I say, it was pretty darn good! One thing I would like to suggest is to add a little more to the portion of spaghetti. I thought the amount was too small for the amount I'm paying for.  I also thought it was quite inconvenient for me to sit on my jacket because all the hooks were taken. A suggestion I can give is I think it would be nice to have chairs with a removable lid so customers could place their jackets inside during the winter. Best pasta ever. Best sangria ever. The best food we had in NY while visiting. Fair prices also. Service 5 stars. My husband has some food allergies and we asked a thousand questions, they were very kind! Absolutely delicious! First of all, Ruby's Cafe offers gluten-free pasta and bread options. My husband, who has celiac sprue, ordered their gluten free cheeseburger. He applauds it as the best burger he has had in NY. I ordered the Whaley burger. Egg, beets, and pineapple do not sound like they go together well with a burger, but trust me, they actually do! I was pretty skeptical by the idea, but the Whaley was unexpectedly delicious. If you are feeling adventurous, I would recommend trying it out. Service was great. We went on a Saturday after 3 and had about a 15-20 minute wait, which wasn't too bad. 5/5 for the excellent burgers and gluten free friendly menu. Ruby's Cafe has two seating areas next to each other, separated by outside doors. The wait was estimated to be 40 minutes for 2 people on a Sunday, but ended up taking only 30 minutes. There was a long wait for the food after being seated. However, I did enjoy the throwback songs such as ""I Want It That Way"" and ""Barbie Girl"", which made the wait a lot more bearable. I ordered the Ricotta Hotcakes, which wasn't particularly impressive. My boyfriend on the other hand, kept raving about the fries that he ordered, but did not say much about his Whaleys.",https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hL7zlA5_mcaASzPEtb9niQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QWf-ZnakY8n6ynnI8FYRNA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gwOEZIE6CFhIfZCo7p6xsg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pR94eeOfmYZuOP4m2osjRQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/76YY19NPVyuWWNGX7SwtvA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jjb__IMP1al3FL-s9DCTMg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/q6ONEtqX6xG_8skXS1R7nw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BDzkBYmTrvz-zq_vZIW96A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dBKsKyHGGqwhgw4KZfjEqA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Ejksch3gaCTU9IOuIj1Agw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_a4sfUBV74_Mkyr979TiRw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vfwpTBJ9EJehCoSu47Zi0w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ny6vDfIxrcAN04PLbiP5Kg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OE5LFnWEufI5qgXErWigEQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WGotKG0jVtGtsWgm7mdE8w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yd_RoJ3saXhgvIK3cs3_Xg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/sDeHR_1yh0ics5bt4zMslQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/sqXbTghHQ6pYcOtQkCMIEg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EutU4Rp6xRvfquHykTp7wA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LRCmOEN1rRk4XXXohuyzHw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/924svW5mf58bcorbhYj1ww/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KCbf5TStdedd2KcjxG0IMA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ID5iSjPsGolgAz87ELL9yQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UHgGMoaIYFNUAhaWRT9IAQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QyFlX7G9Nl3QBJavi7YknA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/K0ilLp1TSvYed697iELpeQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KbPSUzrsYBQPipXfz4oxCg/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,russ-and-daughters-cafe-new-york-5,New York,10002,NY,Bagels,Coffee & Tea,Delis,"Yummmm! This classic comfortable cafe is a great place for brunch. Greeted warmly by the hostess- thanks for charging my phone!Sat up at the counter/bar and shared a smoked salmon benny with kale a perfectly poached eggs on challah- sooooo good! Also had the blitzes with a blueberry compote and sour cream.I can see why this is a local regular spot- I'd be mine too if I lived here! The original NYC's Russ &amp; Daughters Appetizing Store has been serving the best smoked fish in the US for more than 100 years.  It's a true must visit.  Located nearly next door to Katz's Deli creates the epicenter of New York's Jewish food culture and an unforgettable back to back noshing experience.  Russ &amp; Daughters Cafe is what happens when the next generation takes over and merges the old with the new.  In this case it's the 4th generation of the Russ family finally giving their customers ""a place to sit down"".The Cafe keeps all the flavors, charm, and heritage from the original R&amp;D and apply it to a new expanded menu.  The smoked fish remains the star but it is part of an inventive dishes like whitefish chowder or pastrami cured salmon.  For the classic experience you can order the smoked fish platters which come with a bread choice and all the expected accompaniments.  If you are local it's a perfect meal.  If you don't get to visit often and you want to try multiple dishes you can order the not on the menu fish only boards to get the same flavors at half the size and price.  Their menu even expands past fish to include perfect potato pancakes and amazing chocolate babka french toast.  Once you sit down this place lives up to the hype but unfortunately they don't take reservations.  Expect to wait even at odd times and like most places in NYC there is very little space to wait.   You are better off walking around this historic neighborhood while you wait which will make your eventual meal feel even more authentic. Stopped here over the Holidays on a frigid morning with a party of 6, and luckily didn't have a long wait. My wife insisted on wanting a lox bagel, and this place seemed to be the winner (and was).The food was delicious, and I'm not a huge cured fish kind of guy but thoroughly enjoyed my meal and the coffee. I wish I had a bigger appetite as everyone raved about their latkes and french toast. 3.5 starsThe wait is insane, we were quoted an hour and 45 minute wait, though to be fair it was prime brunch time on a Saturday. After we finally got in, we orders the hot smoke cold smoke appetizer, and I ordered the lower sunny side for my entree, which came with eggs sunny side up, latkes, and smoked salmon. The hot smoke cold smoke was good, and went especially well with  the bagel chips.The lower sunny side was solid comfort food, though the latkes were enormous and rather thick while the outside was a little bit too hard for my liking. Smoked salmon was good, but there were only a few slivers of it on my plate. I also tried some matzo ball soup (for the first time) which I was fan of for sure and tasted just like a warming bowl of chicken noodle soup. For dessert we were seduced by the honey cake, which in reality, was a glorified spiced muffin. Quite small as well for the price. All in all, not a bad experience, and would come back if the wait wasn't so ridiculously long. First stop of my long overdue visit to NYC. Was this worth it? I'd say sure, must try at least once. Good food, nice 1920s interior, interesting wall decor which is also found in the washrooms and NO insane wait as I have been told it gets crazy!My friends and I made a visit on a weekday afternoon just probably after the afternoon rush. We were seated approximately after a 5 minute wait and there were also empty booths that had just left. We were served water quickly, which was great and our server took our orders shortly after. We were hungry after a long flight delay and we were glad to be seated and served quickly. No complaints with the service!Our orders: 2 classic boards (Smoked salmon, Cream Cheese, Bagel/Bialy)Eggs Benny (Poached eggs, smoked salmon, spinach, hollandaise sauce)Lower sunny side (Smokes salmon, sunny side eggs, potato latkes)I have to say the presentation of all 3 dishes were nice and clean and picture worthy. The one dish which I thought was more of value and quality was the eggs benny...It just looked yummy and satisfying.The other dishes looked good but pretty much what you would expect on a wooden board or plate. Our meals generally tasted great, maybe also because we were deprived of food...Was the lox and bagel worth $17...Mmm not sure about that...I would definitely give it a try if you are in NYC (especially with all the hype) but for next time I will just get the lox bagel at the cafe as I am told it is more of a grab'n'go kind of thing.P.s I really like the ""number ticket"" wall paper in one of the washrooms...Unique idea! I was rather disappointed by Russ &amp; Daughters Cafe. The name carries a mythical status in the region, and the food and service don't live up to it. I've had better smoked fish at a number of places, including the retail selection at Citeralla in the Hamptons. Although, Russ &amp; Daughters does make one of the best latkes (potato pancakes) in America. After visiting the original location to take out some of the famous lox bagel, I felt obligated to try the dine-in location as well.This place has more of the real Jewish dishes that you heard about, but never dared to try.From Latke to Motze all the way up to caviar. All the goodness of smoked fish and heavy Jewish cuisine can be found here. A lot of the time you will not be lucky to get in as there's a wait, even for bar seating.I had the luck to get in rather quickly at 1 pm for a lunch but if you really commit to try, walk in between 4 and 6.The smoked fish is just as good as the original location. I have tried some of the other dishes but it just wasn't to my taste.I would prefer going to the original one if you are okay with eating outside or staying close by so you can enjoy this amazing culture well. This lox lover could not have been happier to dine at Russ &amp; Daughters! Was my eggs and bacon fiancee just as happy? Maybe not, but he left satisfied in the end.It was a Friday morning and even at 11:00 am, the wait was almost an hour long. Thankfully, they take your phone number and text when your table is ready, so you're free to pop into a bar or coffeeshop nearby while you wait. We eventually landed a seat at the bar and were ravenous. We started with the latkes which were among the best I've had. They were thick and piping hot. Great when paired with the sour cream and apple sauce. From there, I got the classic board which came with lox, a bagel (everything, please!), tomato, onions, capers, and cream cheese. There's a reason why people call these the best lox they've had. They simply are! My fiancee got the cinnamon babka French toast which he devoured. The bartenders were our servers and they certainly had a lot on their plates so I didn't feel super taken care of, and our order got a little wrong but they were quick to correct. I'm happy I had the experience. I probably wouldn't rush back and opt for their grab-and-go spot instead; however, it was worth the wait this once for fish lovers like me! Spiritual. Fulfilling. Adventurous. Bold. Daring. I can use as many words as I need to in order to distract myself from analyzing the amount of food I eat at Russ and daughters. The wait is almost always an hour - today is was 90 min - but we have a good time walking around the neighborhood. It's the best meal in the world and the best place to have it which makes it arguably the best restaurant in the world. A bit pricey, but lovely.  An old-school diner feel, serving classic Lower East Side Jewish fare (which overlaps sizably with classic diner fare, and with classic brunch fare) plus some interesting standouts.The classics include smoked fish boards -- salmon or sturgeon or sable, tomatoes and onions and capers, cream cheese or butter, some sorta tasty bread.  If you like this sort of thing, you can't go wrong here.  They have individual boards (less than $20) or large platters meant for three to four people that go for $80-90 and come with an eye-catching assortment of all of the above, and then some.  (The platters are named after the eponymous Daughters--Hattie, Ida, and Anne--aka The Sturgeon Queens.)Some interesting standouts:* Halva ice cream.  If you like halva, this is a must-have.  If you don't know what halva is, this is as fine an introduction as any.  If you don't like halva... I don't know, man.* House-made sodas.  These are just syrup with seltzer, but each has a teeny twist of sophistication.  For example, the lemon-line soda layers in flavors of anise, dill, and cardamon. That seems like it should be off or too much, but was refreshing, and I don't even like anise.(One heart-crushing thing to be aware of: the famed babka ice cream sandwich is ""a summer thing"", according to our waitress.  I don't understand this menu madness, but it is what it is.)We came here after fasting for Yom Kippur.  The Cafe opened off-schedule for the holiday, at 5pm, and a small line had formed outside the door by 4:45pm.  Russ &amp; Daughters brought out smoked salmon canaps for the folks in line--a lovely way to break a fast.  Service was solid to great throughout.  Thumbs up. 4 stars for the matzo ball soup. This is a very cute and photogenic place. Wait was a big long for New Year's Day. Didn't expect it to be packed but everything was fresh. I especially loved the matzo ball soup. I also got the classic platter (lox, cream cheese, onions, tomatoes, capers and choice of bread. I got the everything bagel). Nothing really blew my mind or stood out from the platter. I think next time I'll try a fish spread. But for sure coming back for the matzo ball soup. Highly recommend. Came by on a Wednesday at noon to no wait for counter seating. Here's the assessment. Is this spot a NYC staple? Yes. Is the food off the chain? Hell yes. Should that give them the right to charge 20 bucks (with tax and tips) for 3 pieces of lox, a bialy, cream cheese, and some vegs? Uhh questionable. I meannn, I get it. Your foods good. But $20 for a lox cream cheese bialy?! That's excessive. But let's talk about the restaurant itself. Super cute. Modern diner feel. Was planning to go to the deli, but good thing I didn't. It was nuts in there (up a few blocks frm the cafe). I had a much better lunch experience at the cafe. The deli is a grab and go. This is a sit down. I went to a few other bagel and bialy spots during my visit, and they're just as good IMO, and don't charge nearly as much as Russ and Daughters does. Sooo there's that. Am I glad I tried this spot though? Yes. Should you come by and try it as well? Yes. Will I come back again? Maybe to try something else. 4 stars. Every time I'm in NYC I make sure to grab breakfast at Russ &amp; Daughters Cafe. I enjoy the service, the atmosphere, and I really love a delicious bagel with pastrami salmon.As others have mentioned there can be a wait, especially on the weekend. I typically go around 10am during the week and have never waited longer than 15 minutes. I always get the bagel board that comes with whipped goat cheese and swap in pastrami salmon, so yummy. My husband and I will usually also share an order or the latkes. The latkes are thicker than most people expect but they're seasoned well and cooked to perfection - I recommend the sour cream and apple sauce combo.I'm not a huge fan of their coffee, but their sodas are super delish.Is this place pricy, yes. Is the service great and the decor on point, yes. I love this place and don't mind dropping the extra cash for greatness. Food was great, but the wait was shocking. Granted, we did happen to go on a Saturday during the height of brunch time, but still, an hour and 45 minute wait is outrageous.We started off with the hot smoke and cold smoke dip, which was amazing. I could not get enough of it, and I thought the portion size was surprisingly good as well. I also ordered the eggs benny. Eggs Benedict is usually pretty indulgent, but the smoked salmon and challah on the Russ &amp; Daughters eggs benny was even more indulgent than usual. At the end of our meal, we were also enticed by the honey cake, which was actually pretty disappointing because it was more of a muffin topped with ice cream.Ultimately, a great place and I would definitely return -- hopefully at a time when the wait isn't so insane. Personally the food, nor the service, were worth the 45-minute wait for ONE SEAT AT THE COUNTER. Having visited the LES many times, the constant lineup at both the Russ &amp; Daughters cafe and the store piqued my curiosity. So, on a Tuesday, just before noon I figured I wouldn't have too long to wait - and boy was I wrong. I was honestly hoping for just a bagel and lox, though the cafe doesn't have that option. So instead, I got the dish with the latkes, the lox and 2 eggs. Admittedly, the latkes were AMAZING and the lox was pretty great, but worth the wait? Hardly. Worth a try if you don't have too long to wait. Otherwise, there are so many other amazing places in the LES, and NYC in general to waste time in line here. Fresh ingredients and good salmon. I sat at the bar and the service was very good. @manudominguezm A sit-down offering of the famed counter location serving Jewish cured fish specialties. Probably not the cheapest out there but the quality and reputation is partly what you're paying for. If you're ordering latkes, go for the salmon roe and creme fraiche. I came here with a party of 4 on a Saturday morning at 9:30am and the wait was 45min- 1 hour... I was actually surprised since 9:30am is considered early for a New Yorker. To pass the time, we waited at a coffee shop across the street. By the time we came back around 10:30, the wait for other parties was 1.5 hours.When we were finally seated, we ordered the Ida platter that serves 3-4 people. It had 4 different types of salmon for us to try alongside with toppings and bagels/bread. I would definitely recommend this option for those who want to try a bit of everything! The slices were extremely fresh and rich. I would recommend this place for sure, but I probably won't be back anytime soon as the wait for this place is so long and there are other delicious places around the area. We drove to New York for a ""food trip"" on a Saturday morning. I should have gotten us a reservation because the wait time was ridiculous. We had to wait an hour to get seated so call in advance and get reservations because this pace gets busy. My girlfriend and I shared the classic bagel which is basically smoked salmon and we picked scallion cream cheese and everything bagel. We shared a bagel because we were going to another place for lunch right after but if you are coming here for brunch then I say get one for yourself. I was first hesitant/shocked that a bagel would cost $17 but it was worth it. The bagel had the perfect texture and the salmon was so good. I loved the scallion cream cheese and it also came with onions, tomatoes and capers. They have a variety of cream cheese including plain, goat cheese, tofu cream cheese and few more that I can't remember. I enjoyed every bit of it.Th service was great. Everybody was super friendly and nice. They do not rush their guests which is a good thing but can become problematic when the line is so long  and the interior gets crowded. The place is also neat.Was it worth the hype? Yes but will I come back? Probably not because its expensive just for a bagel and the wait is way too long. However it's a one time must try place. Had to show my boo the food of my peoples so came here during our trip to NY. He loved it! The whitefish on a bagel with wasabi caviar and wasabi creme fraiche is legit! Got a shrub soda (can't remember which one) and enjoyed it thoroughly. Only thing we didn't rant and rave about, surprisingly, was the lox plate. It's beautiful for instagram but we both agreed the lox had very little flavor. Maybe we ordered the wrong kind, but the flavor was way too subtle for our liking. Would be willing to try again though since they had numerous varieties and I'm sure we'd find something we'd like better.",https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oWTudMvtfgC8QikzeQyLvA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9LeF5jX7StJDRjGBIsWJEg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7UAOp9BhHdYxEcjWH1KdjA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/97BshoiFKyTpE-Q97TzoAQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FK4n9BxwnsBliqANuRL_sQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/L0xcyVWWYd3lErq5rNfRUQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Vj74ZvsrP0ekw3CPAw1n0w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-7Jlp_fdCYfvwv2J85_ONA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DnWaYSPUQZNjSbeDFm4PXg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XUxxOfv5c8FZJO4RSUWKwQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FpFkjxmVxZbQ1o_q8Yv9oA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UyoNBcWRo_cdpCqflWMiaA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lQ6xM72aN2FmH8dO9euj9A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SG7uxGRwMbwNCMZ1fRHeiw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/z7hIElXoOAt6j-M3hM4j9g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4uAcWCvMO7TDnS-zuXhjWQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QRw9X3xFXEyghCZDCXRlGg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OA-zFPRXL3aZAGUWisSNNw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zgGFDi6ubWtJ5D8pSw0DyQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NrS5SFIRKeYwYfbE1BwwWA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UJZTeINB4H6ldfCmrVgJ3Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Xkz-s62rI3svTUIItvLHOw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1SJhOeEWrLAqNC0W0KqCSg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tjjgrQt0leE84KhT7As3SA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/y9Zc2jixXQyeu2B2tIGQJw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VBGiX2BP0o1_UQZDxZbWfw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jN0PVpO--BJSRKnrgTJUzg/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/saigon-vietnamese-sandwich-deli-new-york,saigon-vietnamese-sandwich-deli-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Sandwiches,Vietnamese,NA,"Still amazing after all these years!!! I very often to return to a restaurant after loving it so much to be disappointed in it the next time, but not here! They have the best Banh mi sandwiches I have ever had. The bread is fresh, toasted, and full of the perfect ratio of fresh and amazing fillings. My favorite is the number one combo and add $1 pate to it. Amazing!The man at the counter is as lovely and kind as ever too. I love this place. One of my top favorite meals in NYC! They stayed open toMake me a sandwich so I'm Indebted, thank you**also it was completely delicious and filling. Recommend traditional spicy The best banh mi in the area!I've came here several times for a quick takeout. The owner is friendly and efficient. Their sandwich buns have the right crispiness and weren't rock hard like its competitor next block. The ingredients are fresh and crunchy in generous amounts. Although their prices are a buck more than Bahn Mi Saigon, the sandwiches are heartier and worth the price and more. I found this gem, opened at 7am. I went and got #1 ($6.50). I also got a hot cup of Vietnamese Coffee ($1.50) This store is what makes this city so great. It gives me options: bahn mi for breakfast and why not? The definition of wholesome was probably inspired by this place. When you bite in, you feel your teeth cutting through plump pieces of ham and other meat and the sweet pickled veggies remind you that yes, you should definitely eat more vegetables. This is only the second time I've eaten their Bahn Mi's since Bahn Mi Saigon is only a block away and is one of the best Bahn Mi places around.  Saigon Bahn Mi's are pretty good. I got the #2 Chicken and the chicken was moist and flavorful, but the bread wasn't toasted much and their spicy option was pretty lame.  Any place that just throw in some generic hot sauce just doesn't hack it. This place is really a 3.5, but with Bahn Mi Saigon 3 minutes away, I rounded down. Solid bahn mi's. CASH ONLY. Very limited seating here. The pickled veggies were a bit too pungent, and everyone on the subway and at work could smell them from afar. Tasted amazing though. The #1 and #5 were pretty much the same thing, except #5 was longer... Came here during lunch from jury duty. Got the house special with hot sauce. Amazing! Was tempted to buy another sandwich to go but happy I didn't because 1 fills you up pretty good. The house special with hot sauce is excellent (order with  if you want an extra kick). They seem to bake the bread in-house a few times a day, and the ingredients are very fresh. The trade off is that they often run out of some ingredients around 4/4:30 and close early, so show up before then. I've been here twice and both times my bahn mi's were good. There's always a line and wait time possibly because the place is so small. There were two or three chairs to sit and eat at the tiny counter near the window. Both times I ordered the House special which is the spicy grilled pork. You have the option to not have it spicy.  I prefer my bread not toasted but it does come toasted. I love the tasty pork with all the flavors and right balance of spiciness. The sandwich is a decent size for a fair price in Manhattan. I could've used a little bit more meat because it was that good. The staff were friendly and the place is definitely more of a take out joint. I would keep this spot bookmarked to check out some other menu items. I can't believe that I never reviewed this place! I used to come here often when I worked in the area. The banh mi are delicious and a great deal. My favorite is the #5, the pate. Although it has pork liver in it, it doesn't have that liver taste. During lunch time it can get a little crowded since the space is so small. There are a few stools by the window but most people get it to go. It's cash only. This is by far our favorite Bnh m place. Small hole in the wall.  Absolutely no ambience.  Only four seats (sometimes 5).  Nice staff, great prices.  We ordered #1House Special and #8 curry chicken.  Ingredients are always fresh.  Flavors are wonderful.  The 2 Bnh Mia are fairly spicy.  Bread is toasted just right.  I haven't seen any curry chicken offered elsewhere.  This is cash only but this is a ATM machine inside if needed. Solid viet sandwich. My usual is the house special #1 bahn mi. A good amount of meat to vegetable ratio.They open early so I usually stop by on my way to work. They close shop once they run out of food so closing time varies day to day.Minus 1 star due to the fact that they increased prices twice in a short period of time. #1 used to be a great deal at only $5.50. Then they increased it to $6 and more recently $6.50. Hidden, off from the main streets of Chinatown, you would find this hidden gem spot.  Its small - from the looks of it outside, you will probably think its just another old chinese grocery store - but its actually the home of Manhattans best bahn mi sandwiches.The sandwiches will cost you around 6$ (CASH ONLY) - and although it is pricier than the ones in ct, these are worth the extra dollar.  Every single sandwich is packed with flavor.  My personal favorite is the #1 - combination.  Make it spicy (for no extra cost, peppers and hot sauce).  #3 is my second favorite, the minced pork.  I usually can only eat half a sandwich - and I bring home the other half, for dinner (so technically its 3$ meal for me) A little hole in the wall with great banh mi sandwiches. Minus one star because the bread was a little tougher than I would like. But flavorwise, everything is on point. Pickled veges are very well pickled...not too sweet/not too bland. We had the number one and number five. Number five was our favorite as the pate highlighted the flavors. Serving is huge. One sandwich is good for two people. Vietnamese sandwiches are in my top 5 favorite food.This place would be the place to go. I always get the house special with a Vietnamese ice coffee.The ice coffee is strong but sweet and the sandwich is on point. They have about 10 different types of sandwiches but the house special is the way to go. Hint of sweetness from the cucumbers, sour from the picked veggies and meaty with the deli meat and pork all in a 10inch-ish baguette.The problem with some places is that they toast the baguette to long where the bread would cut ur gums.They never toast it to long. It's always perfect.Sometimes I would bring it home and toss in a fried egg.... fireeeee One of the stop of the NY food tour. This place serve the best Vietnamese sandwich in the city. Get there before 4pm to guarantee they don't sell out of their sandwiches. No line but lots of patrons. The best bahn mi sandwich I've ever had! This place is a no-nonsense eatery that never fails. There is limited seating, only a couple of stools and small table space. Probably not the best location for a date or hours of juicy gossip to share, but you will have some tasty bites here. You will not regret this. Order #1, it's my jam. This place serves absolutely legit Bahn Mi.The bread had just the right texture and crunch on the outside, with all that tender soft breadiness inside.Just the right balance of everything.Chicken was cooked to perfection.I like that they give you a choice of spicy or not on any of the sandwiches. I love this place, try the chicken sandwich, it is very nice and juicy. The most important part of a sandwich is the bread and this store nails it. The bread is kinda like a real Vietnamese French baguette. Best banh mi's ever.My boyfriend and I always eat one there and bring home like 3 or 4. When you reheat them in the toaster oven, it's another level of magic.Speaking of, tomorrow, I plan on getting 4. hahahaha",https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/U7d5Ug_IH6kIJ8t55nC6EQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZQC_ie1ngSuD8vsqKkSdFw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vopikUqmpU6dN8kQmUrjnA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BvagaD2XernHeXR1auN9pw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NbicpHsjQJRjB9sYL7FXiw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/eltE4dUo5MjTl6sNNLyLDw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xHo-Z6CY1TMwWzQ9XQtIRA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IM4G8L5WC-EPk-VpCsVzhw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6cj9yXHgNCLpsrTqQf4TDQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/p-k5eGPKepQMIH5j6GcniA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/w6sCIm4Wo4INOi9dWaTsdg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7i9QJ9qHxWiIKCdqRWQ3mw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4b1cbyNb6c57x-4Yrk_NOQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/86-XD3ktD8HzQtKkk7pTlw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tQVNR1e7TfnhOT-VZBWwsA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YKq4J1WChdSj9c5UzoE83g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vJEqsLBSei34oE7und1sCQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/h7rzYnrFdqFVNqiJR9DI_g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zV4kTgpTYAPRUvYbG3QqVA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3MjNhOjceQTjlH3zVwDMFw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SJJZK0GB165GgwO2o_SrOA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xvOQR-LDbhvn6Q8DQSkKiw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gaWGnBu_elPj5A6c8yvSIQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0hro5u7Q6q-fGcgLOWCxPQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1xZIF2tn1QG6R_J2MsMFVw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/V-JTNO49P5h1EtpnQslKFw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-CfVr_IAdJQ4XIEaOW9q-g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WUOq7Py2uQggg9j3AOcxSw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_Ex9FeXdkl4qgdEJLeKROQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GGtusCoxLFDG0535BLenFQ/258s.jpg
https://www.yelp.com//biz/sakamai-new-york,sakamai-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Japanese,Cocktail Bars,Sushi Bars,"We came here for Christmas Eve. The ambience is intimidate and quiet. It was a busy night so the servers tried their best to be attentive. They also helped me with charging my phone when the battery was almost dead. That's a plus!We booked Chef's Tasting Menu, and it was $120 per person for 6 courses. The portion was actually greater than what I expected. Egg on Egg on Egg is absolutely amazing, and it was served in a uni shell! Not to mention the freshness of the food, the combination of uni, sturgeon caviar and scrambled egg went very well. The scrambled egg was a little warm so when you eat it with the iced uni and caviar, the flavors with the freshness really came out and dissolve in the mouth. The price wasn't too expensive for the portion that we had. The lobster meat of the lobster ramen dish was actually big although the lobster meat was not fresh that day. The portion of the Wagyu Ribeye Steak was ""too much"" that we actually had it as to-go. I definitely miss their Egg on Egg on Egg! I was sick today, so I couldn't really taste much. But I like the octopus and shishito pepper. We also ordered the Wagyu steak, and it's a bit too fatty for me. The triple egg dish is ok, but I mean you gotta order it right?I just wish that they allow one person to order the chefs special, instead of a hard requirement for all or none.I might consider coming back if I'm ever around that neighborhood. This restaurant is incredible and one of my favorites in NYC.  If you like uni as much as I do, you will love the food here.  This restaurant is great for a dinner with friends, work meeting or I'm guessing date as well.  Special shout-out to Dolores, who is probably the kindest person I've spoken to about a restaurant reservation.  Can't wait to go back.Anybody giving this place less than four stars is completely wrong and should be given a puppy. Came here as a 2nd choice on a Sat night, but had a very enjoyable, nice time! Not busy at all, although we did make reservations just in case. So of course, I tried the famous egg on egg and egg. Yes, it's super tiny, but yes it's delicious! Super subtle, but very obviously uni tasting, the caviar and egg itself was superb! Could definitely eat like 20 of these. The bone marrow with the tartare was a really complimentary dish. Why is this pairing not as prevalent as it should be?! The fattiness of the bone marrow and the leanness of the meat work super well together.The kari kari crispy salad was super refreshing! And very plentiful.The grilled octopus was super interesting as it was quite meaty and not the typical octopus texture I was used to. Super tender and soft. Finally the waygu hamburger was probably the least exciting item I tried (it was also served last so I was a bit full). The meat itself taste good but it just got a bit mundane to eat after while, it's a huge patty! And out of the three sauces, I only enjoyed the sesame one.  Didn't have enough room for dessert, but had a very nice meal. Service was decent and ambiance is good for a date or group of friends. A bit pricey but worth it for a nice night out! Definitely recommend! A must try when you're here is the Egg on Egg on Egg. It is steamed egg, topped with uni and caviar. It is pretty small, so if you want to order one for just for yourself because you LOVE uni, no one will judge you!We also ordered the grilled octopus, which is served on spring mix and a few slices of red beets. Good, but nothing super ordinary. The sashimi for three was fresh and a solid choice. It came with fish roe, yellowtail, fluke, oysters, mackerel, salmon and one other fish, and of course, freshly grated wasabi. The duck was more on the sweeter side but still pretty good; it was served with collard greens. We ordered the uni pasta that comes with bone marrow and my favorite part of the meal was the truffle  uni rice pot. It is limited, so hope you are lucky that night to be able to order one.Overall, a delighted meal. I would recommended their Japanese whiskey cocktails when you are here. I just went to dinner here tonight for a work event and let me tell you it was amazing!!! The reviews for this place do not do it justice. If I could give more than 5 stars I would. I am a vegetarian so I couldn't try a lot of the dishes but what I had was cooked excellently, and flavors were mixed in a thoughtful and poetic way so much so that my meat eating friends loved the vegetarian dishes we tried as well. The dishes I tried were: charred broccolini, cha soba salad, little gem lettuce, and kari kari crispy salad. All were AMAZING and well worth it. To me what made this place the most excellent besides the amazing food was the service. Our wait staff was so attentive and knowledgeable and just made the whole experience one I'll never forget. Thank you, Sakamai, for a wonderful evening I'll cherish forever! A high quality Japanese restaurant with great service and unique entrees.Here's a more detailed breakdown of my order:1. EGG ON EGG ON EGG - This is the most famous dish at SakaMai, so of course I ordered it. My first impression was disappointment because it was a lot smaller than I had imagined, but then again, it is uni, so it couldn't be too big. This is such a unique combination and the small size of it made me savor each bite even more. It does feel like a one time thing, but because it is so unique, if I do return to SakaMai, I think I will find myself ordering it again.2. UNI MAZEMEN - My favorite thing I ordered. The ramen noodles were very well cooked and the texture of it mixed with the uni created a flavorful, creamy mix. Halfway through the dish, the waiter informed me that I was supposed to mix the bone marrow with the ramen, and the extra fat from the bone marrow transformed the dish into something completely else. Before and after adding the bone marrow had such different tastes that I would treat them as separate entrees, but both were amazing on their own (but I did prefer the before taste)3. GRILLED OCTOPUS - I was pleasantly surprised at how soft and perfectly charred this octopus was. I savored every bite of it and was incredibly disappointed when I finished it.4.WAGYU HAMBURGER STEAK - a bit of a disappointment. It was the heaviest thing I ordered, and it wasn't for me. Aa someone who prefers medium rare, the meat was very dry. The sauces were flavors I had never tasted before and were fun to experiment with.--Overall, I enjoyed my meal at SakaMai. It definitely is not an everyday restaurant due to its steep price, but I highly recommend it as a place to celebrate a special day.taste / 4aesthetics / 5vibe / 5service / 5price for quality / 4OVERALL / 5 This review is for sake only. We stopped by this sake lounge after being stuffed with ramen. One of my friends was looking for some hot sake which wasn't offered at Yokoya, so I looked up on yelp, and SakaMai popped up. Isn't it great to roam around in NYC? We got seated in the booth in front. Our lovely and knowledgeable waiter recommended a few great sake. We ordered a carafe of Nine-Headed Dragon and another carafe of some sake. Both of them were really good. I'd totally visit this place again. 3.5Everything looks super good but taste was a lil underwhelming as well as portion for the price point. I prob would have bumped it up to a 4 in terms of star if the price was a lil lower. The drinks were surprisingly really good though.Food-Egg on Egg ($19): Good but nothing earth shattering. Its like a japanese egg custard paired with uni and black caviar.Mazemen ($13): This was probably my favorite dish. Its a dry ramen dish with uni and bone marrow. The uni makes it a lil creamy, but not overdone that its a sauce. Taste was also really good.Truffle Uni Rice Pot ($75): This can feed a table of 5-6. Which explains why its 75 bux lol. The taste leaves a lil something to be desired. There were fresh truffles and uni and its cooked in a rice pot. The uni comes out cooked, which some of us didnt enjoy as much as it just being raw. And there just wasnt enough truffle flavor.Ikura Tofu ($12): This one was kinda like the egg custard again, but instead of egg, its tofu. I wouldnt say it tasted completely like tofu tho, it still has that custard texture. Its then topped with salmon eggs. Not bad but prob wouldnt get again. Overall, while I did enjoy the experience, I think at that price point, it isnt enough to make me come back. What an underrated find!! I loved this place! Let's start with the ambiance, the restaurant is beautiful with great decor and fine touches of sale barrels everywhere.Now the food...We started with the shisito peppers which were good but the cucumber dish is a must have. The spicy sauce on top really complemented the crispy raw cucumberThe egg on egg is no doubt amazing. Was really sad when that ended but happy to get the salad followed by the octopus. The octopus was so flavorful and tender it's a must have when you're there. The steak was good but nothing too special the potatoes that came with the steak and sauces were phenomenal! Get the pork belly sliders but you can skip the duck and the 75$ truffle pot might seems amazing but it was really just a lot of rice with a touch and truffle and uni.All in all great experience, great food will definitely come back THIS PLACE IS THE BEES KNEES. I went here for dinner and although the portions are small, the prices are decent for the quality and taste of the food. I stuffed my face with Lower East Side's finest Japanese restaurant. The music and atmosphere is also good here. It's a little dark but that's part of the hospitality experience. I tried the uni waygu rolls, pork sliders (the best i've ever had), sashimi, shashito peppers, duck proscuitto, and the deserts...unreal. You can't go wrong. I'll most definitely be coming back for the ramen, waygu, uni rolls (fantastic), sliders, and to try everything else on the menu. I thought I would like it more, cuz man I loooove my uni. But I can't help but feel a little disappointed because it is not as good as I thought. TLDR: It's a solid three star. There are good things and not so good things to say about this place.Let's go over the dishes we ordered:1.Egg on egg on egg. This is what drew me into the restaurant but it was unfortunately definitely not my favorite. Scrambled egg was too oily and the flavor was too overpowering. Being not the star of the dish, the egg was definitely trying too hard to be present...I imagine a softer steamed egg custard will compliment better for the star of the dish - uni and caviar. Of course I ate all of it cuz it's still delicious, but I wish it would be better. 2. Uni and Wagyu roll. I really didn't like it! For whatever reason, the Wagyu left a bad after taste. Maybe it was too fatty and they didn't do a good job to get rid of that beefy taste. The dish would be much better off without the Wagyu - it was just too much going on.3. Uni Mazemen. Of course we ordered all three of the uni dishes on the menu....This is probably my favorite out of the entire meal. Flavor and noodle's texture was superb. However, this is a very very heavy dish. Noodle was very creamy because of the uni and bottarga already, and they put bone marrow on top of it. My bowl was drenched with grease; but hey that's what makes it good.. 4. Ikura tofu. Not as memorable. I am not a fan of Ikura, but my friend enjoyed  it. 5. Sashimi Platter. Oyster was good, other cuts were not very memorable. Also they served us Ikura even though we already ordered Ikura tofu. Kind of not as considerate and redundant.6. Black sesame cream brulee and Mochi Parfait. Very delicious desert. My second favorite thing for the entire meal.  7. We also ordered Rihaku cloudy Sake. They do have a nice selection if you are into Sake.Other random things: 1. Ambiance is very good. Nice dating spot as they have some private booths in the back. 2. Service was excellent. We were able to get free Sake tasting. The server gave us a full glass for ""test"". 3. Halfway through the meal I noticed a small fly trying to get into my sake cup. There were also some small flies in bathroom. Kind of not expecting this in this upscale restaurant. I'm not a clean freak but it's kind of surprising to see...4. Price is definitely very high...food+drink+tip and tax come out to be $200+. Date spot alert! Tell that girl you like you'll take her to your fave Japanese restaurant. Come here and try the below, it'll (most likely) guarantee a second date. Maybe. Egg on Egg on Egg: I don't like uni. #sorrynotsorry But this soft scrambled egg dish topped with uni is savory, decadent and most importantly a #musttry. This seemingly odd dish melts in your mouth and is refreshingly different than most uni dishes I've tried.Uni Mazemen: Clearly, I didn't pick this. My date did because he wanted uni and I sat there like, ""no dude, that's cool. I didn't just mention I don't like uni five times."" Whatevs.  I'm glad we did because this creamy pasta dish topped with bone marrow is almost as good as the uni pasta from DomoDomo. The only note? Not a huge fan of the egg-y noodles. I wish they used some other type of noodles. Grilled Octopus: Literally, melts in your mouth. How? I don't know. This super tender octopus is delicious and seasoned well. Def have the octopus with some of the sauce that's on the plate, beneath the octopus. This place definitely exceeded my expectations!  I made a reservation for two for 6:00 PM on a Wednesday evening.  They open at 6 so a reservation is not really needed but it doesn't hurt right?!  We were seated promptly and ordered the following:Egg on Egg on Egg ($19.00): all I have to say is WOW.  This was one of the best uni dish I ever had and no wonder this is the most popular item on their menu!  The uni was SO fresh and it paired so well with the warm scrambled egg.  I highly recommend this!Uni Mazemen ($26.00): temomi ramen noodle topped with sea urchin with a bone marrow on the side.  The portion of this dish was small but the flavor was definitely there.  The ramen had a super rich flavor to it paired with the uni.Grilled Octopus ($18.00): I did NOT expect an octopus to be this SOFT.  The octopuses I usually eat are very chewy, gum-like texture but this one was soooooo good.  It takes no effort to bite into the octopus and it literally melts in your mouth once you bite into it.  SO GOOD!Beef Tartare ($19.00):  If you are a beef lover, you have to get this.  This dish consisted of a roasted bone marrow with bread and beef tartare.  Even though I did not try it myself, my friend who had it was blown away by this dish.  The portion is really good too!Spicy Cucumber ($9.00): I really wanted a veggie dish and decided to opt for this!  It was not spicy at all but definitely flavorful.Service - A1!!!  Everyone here is super polite and respectful.  The waiter who served us made sure our glasses were always filled with water.Price/Portion - the portion of this place is definitely more tapas style and the price is pretty high BUT I would definitely come again given the service and quality of their food! I've eaten here twice and both experiences were completely different. First time - overall great experience with delicious food and attentive service. Personally, I think the egg on egg on egg is not worth the price. Nice to try since it's a signature dish, but it's literally less than one full bite of food. The standouts for me are the green tea soba noodles, karage with dipping sauce, tartare, and sliders. If I were grading based on this experience alone, this place would have received more stars.Second time - safe to say that I will most likely not visit again after this experience. I made a reservation, but was told by the hostess that there was ""no room"" in the dining area of the restaurant even though I visibly saw open tables. Since it was winter, I was not pleased with the fact that I was seated across the bar right next to the door. This time, I went to the bathroom and realized not only was it tiny, the soap was SUPER watered down (one of my biggest pet peeves at restaurants). Honestly, if I am paying $$$ at a dining establishment, I expect there to be usable soap and to be seated in an area that doesn't require me to dine with my winter attire. Sometimes it feels like this city has a million ""upscale but low-key izakaya-style Japanese-inspired small plates with sake and cocktails"" places. And none of them deliver on their promise. Except for SakaMai.My friend just got into grad school and we were looking for a place to ball out last minute. I was able to book on OpenTable around 5 pm on a Saturday night for 8:30 that night. I had to call ahead to tell them that we were running 15 minutes late and they were super accommodating.The location is convenient to the F and J though unfortunately in the bustle of the LES bar scene. Inside is an oasis of dim lighting and brick walls. It was pretty full when we got there so they seated us in a back room that felt more Italian than Japanese, but it was nice for an intimate catch up dinner.The cocktail list is beyond tempting-- saw lots of tequila and sake-based drinks. The sake list is relatively curated but has a good mix. We went with a carafe of the Oze No Yukidoke junmai, which was dry and delicious. Service here is top notch; when he poured he let me taste and had some tasting notes on it which were spot on (full melon nose and a crisp clean finish! yum!). Markup is about double on the carafes but we did get reasonably soused for $32. Small beer and wine selection as well.There's a substantial specials list so don't plan your meal out too far ahead of time. This includes daily sashimi and some high-end meat options. The regular menu is divided into categories like meat and vegetables, with a section just for uni. We shared 8 plates among two people and were bursting; we could've gone one or two less. The rundown in order of dishes received:-  Shishito Peppers: Done well, but unless you're craving these and/or always get them, skip to save stomach space.- Egg on Egg on Egg: Wowowow. Everyone says to get this and they're right. I'm not even a big uni fan and thought this was amazing. The eggs are soft, the caviar is salty, the uni is rich. We devoured this. It's like a smoky and decadent upgrade on chawanmushi. Melt in your mouth.- Grilled Octopus: Yes! This was my friend's first time trying octopus (vegetarian until recently) and he said, ""I didn't expect it to be so tender""... and the thing is, octopus can be chewy and rubbery but this was the perfect texture and had a charred and buttery flavor. Quite a dramatic dish too. The watermelon radish and gochujang sauce were nice counterpoints and not just plate decoration.- Amberjack Sashimi: Very good and fresh, served on a bed of ice with garnishes. Price is fair for quality and quantity. Their cooked dishes outperformed this, however.- Bone Marrow and Beef Tartare: More wowowow's from both of us. Another dramatic plate with the full bone. You spread the marrow on the bread and top with some of the raw beef. I could eat this bone marrow all day, it was so smoky and rich (a bit of a theme here). Fun to make little toast sandwiches and all the components are good but the marrow steals the show.- Duck Breast: Yum. Good ring of fat around it and cooked a perfect medium. Was fond of the greens too. Only get if you're craving duck though since it's pricy and the portion is small compared to other dishes.- Filet Mignon: Yes. Comes out on a sizzling plate so take it off quick since it's already cooked to a medium rare / medium. Definitely high quality beef. Comes with fingerling potato chunks and lovely fried garlic slices. The three sauces are fun to try out. I was enamored with the red sauce (Korean-inspired?) and my friend thought the creamy green chimichurri-style one was best.- Black Sesame Creme Brulee: The nutty flavor came through well, and the burnt sugar top was thin and fun to crack open. The almond biscuit didn't add much. Good stuff. Honorable mention for the hojicha tea, which gave us a soothing end to the meal.Overall, I would say the must get dishes were Egg on Egg on Egg, Octopus, Bone Marrow, and Filet Mignon. Everything else was still above average.Service mostly left us alone, though every interaction with them was positive, and it was a relaxed pace meal. It took us around 2 hours in and out. The bill was about $180 before tip, though you could definitely plan it smarter and get out of here cheaper. We were stuffed and went for some decadent dishes.Not an everyday place but worth it for a special occasion. If only you knew the kind of day I had... Possibly the fanciest business meeting at the fanciest building in the prettiest island in the world. That feeling that you had been on the top of the world, literately and figuratively speaking. You'd understand it if you followed me that day. It was that kind of day that led to my high expectations turned sour in Tribeca. Dinner reservation was made at 9:45. Went to the original restaurant three times and they were not ready for us, so I cancelled on my last try and headed to the lower east side. It was a brisk walk. My girlfriend and I were walking gingerly in a city filled with diners and soon to be nightclub goers at 10:30 pm. She had come from upper west side. I have become such a fan of the lower east side over the last three years that wheneverI'm in town I'm there. Passing the New Museum, passing more cool stores, passing slightly drunk Manhattanites, we looked for restaurants as I once again contemplated the real likelihood of living in New York. With a brand new office in Chelsea, and my new headcount and I could be based in New York, I feel a sense, or should I say, a ""real"" sense of possibility? That's when SakaMai came calling. We were hungry. We wanted a quiet place to catch up. This place is super chill. Mellow bartenders and excellent servers. Drink menu is all filled with chilled sake. They gave me an extended menu selection when the usual drink menu failed me. The sashimi for two are amazing and a super bargain at $39. Totally different fish and super fresh, the texture is almost not seen outside of Japan. Or maybe in San Francisco, people don't have such high standard on the freshness of the fish? At $16 for the pot of mussels, it's a steal. Excellent sake.Sashimi and Sake, what more do you really need? Sakes are all yummy. I ordered the cloudy one. We ordered sashimi for two - you get 14 pieces of excellent fish and oysters. Way better than you'd ever get in California and for 2/3 of the price too.The waitress poured more sake for us than we could drink.We catch up on lives - east coast and far east. West coast and its stress. Discuss possibilities. I pictured myself, properly middle aged, drinking sake, having some sashimi, day in and day out, working hard but also living happily for the remains of my day in New York. A life long dream, closer than ever. Property price is borderline a bargain bin basement price comparing to the San Francisco bay area. I will have Sakamai to thank for. Friday 11 pm. A perfect meal. A perfect evening. The night or perhaps a new life, is calling. First off: to the waiter that served us on Saturday June 10 7PM (sorry I forgot your name) YOU WERE AMAZING! Thank you so much for the amazing service and being so attentive and thoughtful. Our experience here was wonderful because of you!Surprisingly on a saturday at 7pm, the place was pretty empty. Onto what we ordered:Egg on Egg on Egg: So amazing, to die for. Every aspect of this dish was so amazing, and my boyfriend (who doesn't care for uni) said this was his favorite dish of the night!Beef Tartare: comes with bone marrow and sliced mini baguette. If you smear the bone marrow on the mini baguette and top it off with the tartare, it is phenomenal, but I do have to say that the beef tartare by itself is a little bland. The two combined together is a great flavor pairing though, so make sure you ration out everything evenly so you have enough bone marrow and baguette for the tartare!Bone-In Strip Loin Steak: flavors were all there, very tender and juicy. the fried garlic slices on top was the cherry on top. sooooooo delicious. the potatoes that comes with this is freaking amazing too.Sashimi Platter (for two): not much to say except very fresh and well sliced!Grilled Octopus: Probably the best grilled octopus I've very had. The dish was really cohesive in terms of flavor combination. Every component of the dish amazed us. 10/10 would recommend!Black Sesame Creme Brulee: yesssssssssss. so interesting, fragrant, and delicious. I would come back again and again just for this!!! This is my favorite spot when I crave some awesome uni. The Uni Mazemen is incredible. It is a mixture of temomi ramen , bottarga, bamboo shoots and YUMMY uni. It also come with bone marrow. This whole combo is really delicious and filling. I would share this bowl with someone or eat it last. It can make you full easily and you don't want to miss out on other things. I had their uni &amp; wagyu roll and beef tartare recently. Both were great. The roll consisted of wagyu beef, uni, pickles and wasabi. Beef tartare was mixed with red miso paste, mushroom &amp; horse radish paired with bone marrow and bread. I must say it can be pretty pricey to eat here. It is worth trying though =) We choose to have dinner here tonight merely based on the reviews. To our disappointment we all found that this Japanese fusion restaurant is overpriced, food was below expectations, bland sashimi that was probably comparable to buffet quality at best. Prior to entering the premises,  I noticed they had a letter B- grade posted at the door with the  last inspection being 12/30/16.  This was already a disappointment, since we know we will be wanting to have raw shellfish and or fish.  We arrived at 630pm, we found the place empty when other restaurants were crowded for dinner service on the same block.  We were seated in the very back of the restaurant on a table for 4.  We were given the pre fix $65 menu, ala carte menu and the menu which had the specials.  Right away I noticed colorful cloths which did not look like napkins but to my surprise these were the napkins we would be using for dinner service.  I swear, I thought it was a rag. I will show you a picture, threads were hanging at the end of the napkins and they do not clean your hands, on top of that we all had different color napkins for our table settings.  Egg on egg on egg ($19) is built inside the shell of a sea urchin. It has been hollowed and filled with a mixture of steam egg that is some what runny and soft. On top they add the uni which had hints of minerality and top with caviar. This all sounds awesome and it is truly beautiful to look at. However, I will start by telling you to not expect a mother of pearl spoon for the caviar. Instead you get a wood spoon, felt like a carpenter for a brief moment but I got over it in light of the beautiful presentation. The soft steam egg in combination with the uni and caviar failed to work harmoniously. The uni overpowered the egg and the caviar had no identity. Clearly I do not expect Beluga or Petrosian quality caviar but it lacked salt.  Beef tartare($19) was a lovely combination of the roasted bone marrow, red miss, crispy maitake mushroom and horseradish that worked harmoniously. We were instructed to make sure we mixed the red miss into the beef. The bone marrow should be used as butter and spread on to the French baguette and the beef is placed as a topping on the bread. I love it and so did the entire table.Wagu and uni roll ($18) 4 small rolls wrap in seaweed. Inside the taste of smoked takuan pickles was the most prominent ingredient, wasabi which I did not taste, wagu beef and top with sea urchin.  We all agreed that we could have done without it.Grilled octopus ($18)was very tender, had a nice char but oddly it lacked flavor. I asked the server where did they source the octopus from and she was frazzled, she simply excuse her self and she ran into the kitchen. She came out a few moments later to let me know it was from Spain. The octopus was resting on a slight amount of gochujang pepper sauce that was spread lightly on the plate, accompanied by a few pieces of frisee and watermelon radish.Chef special sashime plate for 2 ($39) a huge bowl filled with crushed ice and each order comes with 7 different pieces of sashimi.  Our order had an assortment of tuna, oysters, clam, salmon, fluke and amberjack. The tuna was a dull shade of red, seemed dry and it had no taste.  The amberjack was tough, did not care for it. The oysters were excellent, creamy and very meaty.  The salmon was just ok. Nothing stood out of the plate. My daughter even commented that if this was the chefs special platter, it really made you think what the regular sashimi order would be like. I know there is some sarcasm but if I go out for Japanese food. I expect great sashime. Instead today we relied heavy on cook food item menu, which is something we never do. Uni Mazemen ($26) is actually a bowl of them ramen noodle with sea urchin, bone marrow and bottarga ( cured fish roe) we were instructed to scoop the bone marrow out and mix it with the ramen.  The ramen itself was over cooked, the noodles had no bite but the did have a very good flavor. Once mixed with everything else in the bowl the combination of ingredients was very good.The ingredients form a creamy consistency and a silky feel to the palate.For dessert we had the black sesame creme brulee which everyone at the table raved about.Just in case you were wondering, we sort of made our own tasting menu and we shared the plates which was a fun way to try a few items without much commitment to anyone individual plate.  I don't think I would come back again. After reading the health inspection report, I give this place zero stars. However, there are some items that are good on the menu. To the management, your wait staff is very accommodating, polite and you restaurant has a nice ambiance. However, even with all that it is still not enough to create repeat customers. In case you were wondering dinner was about $225. No alcohol consumed on the table as we were there to have a pure experience based on food only.",https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/si_xEkxbPg1iFYuq59gCSQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HyUGcP6t-TUJQO6azGWU2g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HzBz6lztNQBBRx7Hyzu21A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VRMSUBYwxXeADjK5q3hedA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6htQhHMo9Il9ilS7b3bU5Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/eMQlX9SrBWSZTR8sVB9JNA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/d7zgTsgeW_UXiWtEZJ2JUg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8Gst8LkUaRz-hDVWuIg6mA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2qABjSLK1mZLBlrS7AU-WQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/96NkP7SGRyP5PL-kthAy9g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kfyVHJ8vCPJAdsDM3QJFQg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dU0PYo77EIDEpDSk62bKNg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ioxbimU-lQHVoxQ2A5bQsA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/j4KDvr7XfcGcr_BkDPCGtw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/z8t5avIgDLjIgkbOKY25eA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/t_SCC-qZl7KH4fi0w6gTKw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EON14Ig4UdwRhzxnOcATsA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DmvFq0X8VU-jDqeD5n8Kmw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yTLIUup459odby_Z7N_y7Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/J5YShIoVjNjFxA2zuZdUsg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EqkiJ755pqTkZBmUniqwMw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ILqxck1Up73gphemd3z9ZQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/r5eANFTiy6ET0wnlUdY6xg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6qThQDjty1XQNeu5XS4ShA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cDMC0Zm-Eojt5R0gWdAVhQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hd6Rbc4xnwpyTEnw5DMwIg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fGXbNGYra88AFdjJE-imqw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qE_cIuPZaC75Pm-iA3hiew/258s.jpg,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/sel-rrose-new-york,sel-rrose-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Cocktail Bars,Seafood,French,"My friend frequents Sel Rrose and highly recommended it. I made a reservation through OpenTable and was seated early on a Thursday evening. The service here is relaxed, but our server was too quick to leave the table and didn't check in on us. The servers float around a lot, checking to clear tables. I would give the service a 3, but honestly, I loved too much of the cocktails, food, and atmosphere that I am sticking with my 5 stars.We ordered a dozen oysters during Happy Hour. I enjoyed almost every oyster I tried. They were great! The Santa Rosa cocktail is incredible. I ordered 3 (no shame, it was my birthday!) It's a tequila cocktail with sparkling ros. We shared the Steak Tartare and Citrus Marinated Chiogga Beets. Both dishes were fantastic, and quite large portions for tapas (pic). We finished with the Chicken Liver Pat, which was very creamy and spreadable.I would love to come back to try more cocktails and different share plates. Highly recommend for date night or girls night. The ambience is dim, candlelit, and romantic. Highly recommend for after-work drinks. This place was suggested to me by my first Yelp (Elite!) friend ever, so I know she wouldn't suggest anything subpar (thanks, Mel!). The drinks here did not disappoint and neither did the decor. Very LES!I ordered the Santa Rosa - Sparkling Ros, tequila, orange bitters, lime, and rose syrup garnished with a rose bud because they're trendy like that. The drink was massive so I couldn't have more than one. I would say it was worth the price.I know this place has oysters but I didn't get a chance to try them or the other apps. I'd come back here for happy hour though. I believe it's until 7pm. I came here for happy hour at 4PM on a Friday and the place was empty. I was seated at a table immediately. There is only happy hour on oysters and not on drinks, which is from 4PM-7PM. If you want a drink with your oysters, then you need to pay full price ($14). I opted not to order one. There are six types of oysters on happy hour but please note that only ONE kind is $1 and the other five were $1.25 or $1.50. The six types available when I went were Big Rock, Wellfleet, Petite Crowe's Pasture, Capital, Fin De La Baie and St. Simon. I ordered a dozen, with two types each because I wanted to try all the different types and taste the different flavors. My favorite was Fin De La Baie because it was very smooth and not too briny. I did not enjoy the Petite Crowe's Pasture or Capital as much. St. Simon was worth it for a $1 - I could have ate another dozen of that. Solid place for oyster happy hour if you want to try different kinds for a good price. But I wish they had a happy hour for their cocktails. I found this place through yelp and have been wanting to try this place. When I was in NY, I came here with my friend for happy hour! I believe they don't take reservation if you want to do happy hour.The set up is kind of a weird juxtaposition. We sat outside and was facing the busy streets. It was a funny scene to pair with our meal. We ordered some truffle fries and oysters. The oysters were delicious! Also, you can't go wrong with truffle fries.  They also have a small selection of cocktails, wines, and beers to choose from. It's a cute date spot or to good spot to catch up with a friend! I definitely recommend trying this place if you are in the area! The restaurant is upscale, open and the perfect HH spot for good oysters and drinks. $1 oysters during happy hour, 4-7PM get you any oysters on their menu! I love this, because most happy hour oysters are limited to one selection. We got about two dozen oysters between the both of us, and tried most of the oysters on the menu. All were delicious and so fresh! We also got an order of truffle fries, which were seasoned and fried to perfection. I got the Spring and Delancey, which was on the sweeter side, but nonetheless tasted good. Cocktails all range from $12-$15, sadly there aren't any specials on the cocktails. There's a few tables outside as well, for a nice summer day. Definitely will be returning for some good oysters! Was craving some oysters so we went there for happy hour. There were , several kinds of oysters on the HH menu, were mostly $1.25 and $1.5.. I wasn't too happy with the oyster selections, most of them were like pink finger sized and not so briny. Also there was no drinks specials Service was not the best, not much attention from our waiter. And he also messed up our check with the regular oyster price instead. Cafe review;""It was great catching up with you. I have to catch my flight now"".""I used to have my own office and was high up in cooperate but then I decided, screw that, and quit"".""Can I get a double shot of espresso with that"".""Excuse me, how do I get to Lafayette street, I'm trying to go to ______"".I kid you not, it only takes sitting here a few hours to soak up all that quintessential NY-ness. It's buzzing outside on Delancey St but once you step inside, the playlist, calming feels, retro look with a dash of swanky French modernism all react to create the perfect buffer to noise cancel any concrete hustle decibel. I haven't tried their pastries but my latte was pretty solid. Prices are very reasonable considering the location. Come to read a novel. Come for your coffee break. Come to catch up with a friend. Other useful info:- WiFi is unlimited.- There are NO plugs/outlets. I repeat, no plugs or outlets!!-They've that ceiling paint chip look going on and I'm not sure if that's healthy/sanitary or just a design but they've an ""A"" so I guess NYC health approves. If you're sick and tired of Bluepoints oysters, Sel Rrose might've just become your next favorite oyster happy hour spot. Your search is probably over since this place has St. Simon oysters from New Brunswick for $1 apiece from 4-7. Please take note that happy hour only applies to oysters, not on any drinks. Draft beer selection is alright. You'd rather cross the street to One Mile House for a better selection there, plus cash back! I went crazy and ordered 3 dozens of oysters. I got 18 St. Simon, 6 Big Rock from MA, 6 Chelsea Gem from WA and 6 Aunt Dotty's from MA. I'd recommend the last two. Chelsea Gem are buttery and very briny. Aunt Dotty's are just perfectly briny. This place was decent. Your average cocktail bar slash gastropub.I got the le mount which is a nice whiskey based drink. The pink negroni was also nice. Cocktails are strong well made. Cocktails are all around $15In terms of food, I ordered the poached octopus which was really an octopus salad with celery and chickpeas. Not very impressive. It wasn't bad but not worth what they were charging. Dishes were around $15. I also tried their chickpea fries which were very good. Imagine vegan mozz sticks.Their truffle fries are incredibly addictive.My favorite dish of the night was probably the beef tartare. It was very well seasoned and the leeks went well with it.My friend found a fly in his drink, but they replaced it promptly.I don't think I'll be going out of my way to come to this place. It's hip and the drinks aren't bad but nothing about it really stands out to me. It's your typical pricey/sceney bar downtown. BF and I shared:+ truffled risotto croquettes+ watermelon &amp; cucumber salad+ poached calamari+ truffled fries+ corn side dish (forget the exact name)Decent food. I'd say the standouts were the watermelon salad and truffle fries. Drinks were a little sweet for us. I had the poolside convo and was expecting a little more passionfruit flavor but couldn't really taste it. 3.5 stars. This place is great! We came with a group of friends Saturday night and the bar was pretty busy. By the time most of our group showed up, we were lucky to score some tables in the back. The bar was pretty much packed until we left. // DrinksThe drinks here are delicious! We didn't have a single one we didn't like. My bf and I started with some mezcal cocktails: Vida Verde and The Hunter. The Hunter was our favorite of the 2, so much that the bf ordered another. I also got the White Rose which is absolutely delicious and creamy because of the egg white. I highly recommend!// Service A waitress got us drinks from the bar and put them on our individual tabs that were already open behind the bar. Great service! Sel Rose makes an AWESOME cocktail.  In my mind I thought this was a wine bar, but cocktails are defined nicely their speciality.I got the White Rose, consisting of rye, honey, ginger syrup, lemon, egg white and pineapple. It was fantastic - smooth and balanced, not too sweet or liquor forward. Just wonderful.My friend and I split a bunch of small plates.  The Parmesan truffle fries were the clear winner - a must get! We also ordered the Tuscan kale salad and the bursts, both were excellent.  The plates were actually a pretty decent size, so we definitely didn't finish it all!The service was OK. The ambiance was great - dimly kit, rustic yet fashionable cocktail lounge decor. Good place to keep in mind when in the LES. Oysters, rose, and and good company? There's no better way to celebrate the end of the week. My girlfriend and I came to Sel Rrose with reservations Friday evening at 7 and the place was jammed packed. They offer a variety of seating options that include outside seating, bar seating, and regular table seating. The seating options are relatively small so this place is better for parties of 2-6. If you have a larger party I would definitely call in to see if they can accommodate. The decor of the place is very plain and simple, which I do not mind at all. The minimalisticness makes you focus more on the food and company. A-Okay in my book. For food my girlfriend and I got the Chef's Special Oyster platter and a few cups of rose. The oyster were all very fresh and super delicious. The vinegar is a perfect sauce to put on top.Overall, I am happy to find a place with great oysters. I am sad that I missed the $1 oyster happy hour but will definitely be back next time! Beautiful space, terrific cocktails, and oysters! What more can a girl want? Oh wait, they serve craft coffee too during the daytime? Now I'm really smitten! In all seriousness though, Sel Rrose's space is so gorgeous it should come at no surprise that plenty of IG pics get snapped and posted within their premises. I wish it was located along my daily route so I can frequent it more but for now I'll need to contend with planning oyster and cocktail hour dates or mid-day coffee stops at Sel Rrose. I first got to visit Sel Rrose on New Year's Eve. I was looking for a relatively low-key place to countdown the last of 2016 with my fiance and learned that they were offering reservations for NYE minus the usually overpriced prix fixe dinner menu. So I jumped on the chance, booked a table, and my fiance and I planned for a night out! And it was lovely! There were oysters and great wine and even a nice little burlesque show! We even danced as we waited for 2017. Thanks for the fabulous time Sel Rrose and see you soon! This review is for Sel Rrose cafe next to the restaurant. First impression of this hidden gem was how adorable the decor is! Baristas are always welcoming and the coffee is spectacular. I always get the iced latte here with a croissant, make sure to come in the morning when the croissants are fresh. It's flakey on the outside and soft on the inside, everything that makes up a great croissant. I was hesitant to write this review because I kind of wanted to keep this beautiful place hidden from the world but keeping this place from other coffee lovers such as myself, would be too selfish. I haven't dined in the restaurant but I am sure the restaurant is amazing as well. $1 and up oysters happy hour...I can't complain! Service was good..truffle fries are a must try! The oysters are pretty small though so don't expect big slimy oysters lol but you can't go wrong with two dozen oysters..they didn't offer any saltine crackers with the oysters..and I usually eat them with the crackers. Boo. But I'd still return :) I heard these guys do dollar oysters so I decided to check it out. It's true. I ordered a dozen and each was on the half-shell, already shucked for me. The bar serves a lot of cocktails. They also serve beer and wine. My early &amp; casual happy hour easily became a great catch up session with a friend! Not so sure if it was their happy hour, but oysters were $1-$1.75 each. My friend and I got SO MANY. Maybe two dozen? I also got the Ros on tap, which was a great bubbly drink to have for a spring happy hour. We also ended up getting croquettes and the truffle fries, which we obviously devoured.  Our waitress was helpful--she seemed a little tired but I totally get it. (Who isn't on a Tuesday?!) Other servers were also helpful even though they were not in charge of our table!! When our server was not around, they checked in with us when we seemed like we were looking to order. I was there from 5-8pm on a weekday. At 5pm there were only a few people and by 7pm the music got louder with more people. I'll definitely be back! What a gem! A friend recommenced this place for drinks/oysters and it did not disappoint (I went back 2 out of the 3 days I was visiting)!  Their selection is great and if you have time/appetite, try one or two of each. I'm solely a sparkling wine drinker and don't like added flavors or ""show"". But I discovered their Lavender Piscine and it was amazing!  Not to mention, their truffle fries hit the spot and the service was great! This place was a pretty standard cocktail bar for the Bowery and Delancey area. The drinks were very good, and they have a lot of creative ones. I had the White Rose, a rye whiskey cocktail with a healthy dose of ginger syrup. It was right up against that line of too spicy on the backend. The drinks are priced accordingly and that's all I'll say on that. It was crowded and loud...cool if you're in that mood, just not my cup of tea.",https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wLNtWS2AlVJoPcaiehz3nw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PSF84grZZzNn1SUGBsMMqA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kZSCJ2y1TQ9axHYD9dU8jQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4O49cYsPXOfo5mTN3cr45w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/33aiJLAv8oqAf4mKxx0qDg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2aeTqgA8MfVzy5p7DFJIbw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3z6AuoI_c9DDx3Ky9Djk0Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/sq-ysYDAr7iNuOqdk1m0ZQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/V0kz40Ud1f5CB8oQZgrfHQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-Ejs3GBMdln8YPZ2SABchA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/o62OISvOs5i1gW66epwD1A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LI2rkD9R2Br0ofVjc_HlwA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/2JA5afB7jr484rOkke_ftA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tw_3BbipXS1F5VCo5O-clw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QpxY7Vy8CHs6xNFLhfjjhA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/I20x04gcaYca4Yy87-cQuA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CdAqkdretuhbuY496ksVFA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lU8k5uIYxhu42FCuPMLMxA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lFqAMgLWivPp9BYSYAJWrg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jrlMh_qhQk4QxEBWRFB0dg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/K_28vsY2w8XR-QpdmOK1Ew/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ut15OfSDQaTdwc3e-K5y7Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Z7S1-2mj4aPq76XaFt3u_A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/f7W2ijPROEpur3XbLDiJCw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZuIDGBZQUFH9zEHV0F57UA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MKia_8XVTbsbAtxHMGIAKQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gzjHxKP7AK-oM_PWVft7Sw/258s.jpg,NA,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/set-l-e-s-new-york,set-l-e-s-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Gastropubs,Asian Fusion,American (New),"Ok I loved this place. My bf and I didn't know reservations are preferred but a worker found a table to squeeze us in. From the second we walked in he was super accommodating and we were seated within a few minutes. We came on a Saturday night so I cant talk about the tacos (not available that night) but the sliders were amazing! Between the two of us we tried the dry aged burger, bulgogi cheesesteak, Bahn mi Vietnamese steak and fried chicken slider (can't remember the name). They were all great. Super flavorful and perfect sized.  The bun didn't get too soggy and fall apart and each bite was delicious! If I had to choose a favorite though, I'd go with the Vietnamese steak sliders. It comes with a slice of cucumber, carrots and sriracha mayo. The cucumber gives it a fresh light taste to counteract the spiciness of the mayo- just try it. You'll love it trust me. Another tip: try the tempura shrimp poppers to start. 10/10The loaded tots are great and come with a bunch of toppings. It's $13 and we could only eat half and had to bring the rest home with us lol. The service is great, food is great. I'll def be back. Set les was amazinggggggggg every food we tried hadFlavor, so so good I went with 5 other friends and we alllll loved it and can'tWaitTo go back Service: Our waiter was friendly and attentive. Food came out promptly. They even gave our birthday girl a champagne bottle with a sparkler! What I ordered: Set 3 - $13 (Vietnamese banh mi buttered steak slider, pork belly skewer and Cajun waffle fries). The slider was my favorite part, the steak was so tender and flavorful. The skewer was a little too fatty for me but it was pork belly though. Cajun waffle fries was your average waffle fries. Overall, it was a decent amount of food and tasted good. Price: Worth it. Overall thought: I would definitely come again, especially for a birthday dinner. I had bookmarked this spot after seeing pictures of amazing Asian fusion tacos on insta... unfortunately they only serve those M-F. I was still super impressed with the food and will definitely be back for tacos. I wasn't expecting a sports bar so I was especially impressed with the unique menu. My brother and I both ordered sliders, I love that they let you mix and match because a lot of places don't let you. I had the pork belly (a little too much fat but still tasty), bulgogi (*amazing*) and steak (slightly overdone but still delicious). My brother had the chicken instead of the bulgogi and we loved that one too. The sauces and spicing on each of the sliders was on point.We also split the loaded tots which were amazing (and hard to finish)... it was way too much food and nice to have leftovers! My friend was happy with his wings and beef skewer, I tried a bit of the skewer... it was perfectly tender! Our waiter was also super nice (and seemed to be running the place by himself!) can't wait to go back, highly recommend this place! My first time and overall a pretty good experience. We came just before the after work rush so we were seated immediately and ordered and received our food very quickly. Items we ordered included sliders, tater tots, and wings.3 sliders per order for $14 or you can mix and match sliders for $15 and option to add waffle fries for an additional $3***GRILLED SESAME CHICKEN SLIDERS  topped with their Slaw and a Tangy Spicy Sambal Sauce.BANH MI LEMONGRASS CHICKEN SLIDERS came with Slice of Cucumber, Pickled Carrots and Sriracha MayoSOY GLAZED PORK BELLY SLIDERS topped with Slices of Cucumber and Tangy Soy Garlic SauceSALT AND PEPPER FRIED CHICKEN SLIDERcame with Shredded Lettuce, Jalapeos,  Garlic, Sweet Chili Sauce.** sliders were pretty good. All were decent in size and shareable. Sesame Wings-$12 decent size wings that were crunchy tossed with a tangy sweet and spicy sauce. SET TATER TOTS  $13 Loaded Tots w SrirachaGarlic Cheese, Bulgogli Sliced Ribeye, Bacon Bits, Scallions, Fried Shallots, Slaw, Pickled Onions, Chipotle Mayo and Ketchupcrispy tater tots brought me back to grade school MmmMm. Definitely an artery clogger but worth it.CRISPY WAFFLE FRIES $6 crispy and perfectly friedPOPPER SHRIMP- crispy fried shrimp tossed in a yummy sauce. Service was average. Staff was there when needed and we had to ask for items we needed. Nothing too special or memorable I can recall. Good place to meet up with friends to grab a bite to eat, grab some drinks, or both. When I'm back in town visiting my sister I'll be stopping by since she often frequents this place. Not because I used to frequent this spot on a weekly basis for a year and on a first name basis with all the proprietors...Not because they serve banging... I mean Banging waffle fries Not because the calamari ranks pretty high with sweet tamarind-teriyaki sauce that you can dip those amazeball fries...Because of the Bulgogi Sliders. The perfect 3x3x5 full fist size slider I've ever had the pleasure to palm and ingest. Religious almost, the way the cheese melds into the shredded BBQ beef and clings on for dear life. Oh dear G*d. This single handedly beats out any burger joint, any slider, anyTHING sandwiched between 2 slices of carbohydrates I've had. So, come to set to have a fantastic time. But if you want to be mind-blown by unassuming corner bar turning out one of the best tiny burgers this little town has to offer- by all means, order the Bulgogi sliders. Great spot for getting some extremely tasty food and washing it down with drinks of your choice, or, ask the bartender to choose for you.All the sliders and tacos are super tasty. The pork belly skewer is really great (it's got a lot of fat in it. If you don't like fatty meat, skip this one).Charbroiled oysters reminded me of New Orleans. I left very satisfied. Of course will need to eat a salad  tomorrow. Amazing. This one word describes it all. The service, taste, quality, ambiance.. Its all just perfect. I contemplated on leaving this review cause I honestly don't want to share this place with everyone but they deserve it. Thumbs up. 5 stars. Just. freakin. beautiful.Steak and eggs - perfect. The picture says it all.Hangover tots - they were missing the spam but still delicious.&amp; the sliders were absolutely mouth watering. The pork belly esp!!! I will start off by saying the food is delicious. I had the breakfast tacos and they were absolutely delicious. A friend of mine had three sliders, which he also said were very good. Unfortunately, the service was not as good. My friend and I placed our orders at the same time, except his food came out and mine did not. After waiting for at least 15 minutes and wondering what could take so long to make three breakfast tacos, I asked the waitress where my food was. She went to check and then came back stating that they forgot to make my food. Thus, I had to wait even longer for the food to be prepared. By the time my food arrives, my friend's was cold because he had been waiting for mine to come as well. It was redeeming that the food was really good and they took my meal off of the tab; however, the experience would have been at least a 4-Star had my food not have been somehow forgotten. I would definitely still go back to try for a better experience because of the great food. This is probably one of the place that I had a really bad experience with the waitresses. Like tbh service never bothered me in NYC because its fricken New York. I came to this place on a Saturday based on the reviews I had read from yelp and I liked what I read. The restaurant was decent size and there was like one or two other tables besides us. The other table was super loud and the music was on super loud too, could barely hear the person next to me talk. That was all fine. We ordered:Set 1 ($13): it had one chicken slider, one beef kebab and a lot of fries. First of all ask yourself if you would pay $13 for one small slider and one beef kebab with fries. Now the taste was very bland and no flavor whats so ever besides the kebab which was decent.Set 2 ($13): this had one pork belly slider, a chicken kebab and fries. This was worst than set 1 because the flavor was not good. To much combination of flavors that shouldn't go together.Sesame Chicken Wings ($10): this was my favorite actually. 6 wings to an order. The flavor was nice, sweet and spicy. Super crispy too. BUT BE AWARE... if you come on the weekends, they will try to charge a ""mandatory gratuity"" where they do not inform you about until you get your check. My waitress came over twice... to order and to give the check, there is one other time where she peep over from another table and was like everything ok, but before we answer she left already. When I got the bill, I realize it looks off... "" mandatory gratuity"" and then suggested more gratuity on the bottom... THE THING IS she had the audacity to charge an 18% gratuity... someone had to get her from the chair to bring me a check.. like you really think you deserve 18%? But after I confronted her about it, she was like ""oh, so its fine if you don't want to tip me"" and later took the ""mandatory gratuity"" off. Like honey please... Set had been on my list to check out for a while and I finally went for dinner this past Thursday night.  We walked in around 7:30pm and the place only had a few people.  It filled up by the time we left at 9pm though.  The atmosphere is sports bar chic, which I dug.  We made it in time for the happy hour and I got the $6 lycheetini, which I wasn't really a fan of.  There was something off.  I like latitude and verlaine's better.  Maybe a non-happy hour one tastes different? The service was really friendly but the server didn't come by again after we got our food so our water glasses were left empty for the rest of the meal.  Also, we were considering getting another drink but didn't get the chance.Alright, let's talk about the food. Some things I really liked and some things I really didn't.  Let me start by saying I'm not the biggest fan of mixing sweet and savory but I do make exceptions for korean food because some dishes are known to have a touch of sweetness.  However, the pork slider at Set was so sweet, I couldn't eat it.  The fried chicken slider was also a bit too sweet, but I could finish that at least.      We also got the loaded tots, which were pretty awesome I must say, but that too had a little more sweetness than I would like.  Hadn't had clams in a while so we threw clams casino into our order, which were just ok and probably wouldn't get again.  The aged beef slider was straight out amazing, could have had 5 of those. I'd say Set is a solid place to grab drinks and have a quick bite before a night out.  Also, although some food was too sweet, it was all still packed with flavor so I'd encourage you to still give it a try. Food is WAAAAAYYY too salty. Did not want to finish any of the food or even touch the pork belly skewer because of how salty it was. My friends and I ended up not finishing the food, what a waste. Prob won't be back for awhile. I ate at the bar with a friend on a Sunday night so it was pretty empty. I ordered the buttered cube steak skewers and the tangy garlic wings. Both were good but the wings were delicious. You get 6 with an order but they are meaty wings cooked with a texture that was crunchy enough for my liking. Friendly bartender! I could have got more stuff but I wanted to get home. Loved this place! I came here with a group of around 8 people on a Tuesday night for my roommate's birthday dinner. I ordered the 3 for $12 set taco special and it hit the spot. Bulgogi cheesesteak taco, tempura fish taco, and tempura shrimp taco were all excellent. The lychee martini was also super delicious!The staff was very attentive and even brought out a bottle of champagne with the sparkler on top for the birthday girl! It was a super sweet gesture. Definitely a great place to satisfy an asian-fusion craving :) I came here on a Saturday, pretty excited to try this place since it's been on my list a while. It was later in the afternoon so it wasn't crowded at all. I tried ordering the breakfast wontons but was later informed they were out. I instead got the breakfast tacos and had a Cape Code Lemonade. While I could taste the gin in the cocktail, I'm not sure if it's super strong since I had a pretty carby meal. So I think I'll have to come back to test that ;) The breakfast tacos were bomb and I got waffle fries with it which were very well-seasoned. This place is great for comfort food and you get a good amount of food for the price. I'd definitely come back again, maybe even for happy hour, or another brunch! I wish I could say that the food is good but unfortunately this is not the case. I came with high expectations from seeing the mouth watering pictures on social media but looks can be deceiving!I had ordered a sampler of tacos and sliders with waffle fries. Let's begin with the fries. Can someone tell me how you can mess up fries?! I absolutely LOVE anything potato and waffle fries especially but I just couldn't get myself to finish them or even enjoy them. There was something off about the sauce that came with the fries but that's okay, you should be able to have fries on their own right? Alright maybe it's not okay but I could live without some chipotle sauce. The fries were mostly stuck together and seemed to be over fried because it tasted like pure oil (where's the Cajun?). Then it was all downhill from there. The sliders came next and were nothing special except extremely salty. The tacos finally came and was probably the highlight of my meal even though it was mediocre at best. The only thing I really enjoyed was the fish taco. I didn't get to try the charbroiled oysters and cajun clams this time but after this visit, I don't know if I'd be back. So I've had Set L.E.S. bookmarked for a couple of months now, and I finally had a Thursday free to go try their tacos. Set opens at 5pm, and there's happy hour from 5-8. Me and my friend went right when it opened to take advantage of the happy hour specials, and to beat the inevitable crowd. It was actually very very empty even until 6, and it felt a bit weird being the only people at the restaurant so we waited a bit until it filled up some more. We chose the window seats right next to the street so there was a lot of natural lighting and a nice breeze. We got started with the loaded tots, the clams casino, a lychee martini for each of us, and we each got the 3 tacos for $12 (we both chose the chicken, shrimp, and fish tacos).The loaded tots are BOMB. There's everything you could possibly want on top of them- cheese, bulgogi, pickled cabbage, ketchup, scallions, and onions. There is more than enough toppings for all of the tater tots, and each bite is so amazing. I think this dish you can definitely share with 4 people. It's jam packed with tots and toppings.The clams casino were so good as well. The clams were pretty fat, and there's a nice herb breadcrumb crust, and most importantly, BACON BITS. It's 6 clams for $9 so not bad on the pricing either. The lychee martini was only $6 during happy hour, and they were surprisingly strong. I expected something cheap and weak, but I could definitely taste the alcohol.The tacos however were disappointing. The thing with the tacos is that they look absolutely amazing- popping with color, perfect tempura batter, the works really. The bahn mi chicken was probably the best out of the 3 I tried. The chicken was perfectly tender, and it went really well with the pickled carrots and radish. I think the ""bahn mi"" ended at that though- there wasn't anything else that was reminiscent of a bahn mi sandwich, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.The shrimp tempura was a bit of a letdown. What I noticed was that there was a lot of extra tempura batter only. The shrimp itself was nice and sweet, but there was so much unnecessary batter pieces. The overall taco was sweet due to the sauce as well.The fish taco could have been good, but i just found the whole thing to be too SOFT. The fish itself did not have the crispy tempura coating it desperately needed to give it a texture contrast. The fish was nicely cooked and soft, but the avocado just added to the softness, and the entire thing was just a bit too mushy for my liking. The pickled cabbage was a nice touch but I really wished it was more acidic and a bit crunchier. It wasn't bright enough to stand out from the fish or the avocado unfortunately. The biggest travesty of the tacos was the SHELL (or tortilla? I'm new to the taco game so I don't know my terminology yet). I really hope I'm wrong but they tasted store bought to me. The texture was just so off, and tasted NOTHING like the authentic tacos I've had before. Obviously this isn't legit Mexican tacos, but you would think the tortilla would be good at least. There was a really grainy and powdery taste to the tortillas, and it tasted EXACTLY like something you would find prepackaged at a supermarket. The tortilla just ruined all of the tacos for me, especially the bahn mi since that actually had the potential to be so good. Overall I think this is a pretty solid restaurant to drink and chill, but I would say avoid the tacos really. They look so good, but the taste just didn't match up. Came here for a birthday brunch -super chill place! I got the set#2 on the regular menu (pork belly slider and chicken skewer with waffles fries). The waffle fries are really good- the meal didn't look like that much but it was enough! Presentation is cute. Skewers were pretty good!!! Next time I'd try the smoked salmon slider. I really recommend the loaded tots to share for the table- so cheesy and yummy!!!I like the vibe of the place- will be back for tacos. Good comfort place food. I was attending an artist collective down the block two weekends ago and stumbled across this place with a few friends. The menu looked appealing enough and we were seated as soon as we walked through the door. Our waitress was very helpful and kind, allowing us ample time to look over the menu and bringing our drinks to us right away.For a table of three, we ordered the Banh Mi Buttered Steak Sliders, Waffle Fries, and the Set Loaded Tots. Everything came out quickly and tasted great. The tots were a bit spicy, to my liking but still very flavorful. My personal favorite was the sliders- the meat was like a flavor explosion in your mouth, and so very juicy. A bit on the tough side, but I didn't care as much about that.Overall, a great place to share some quick bites or small plates with friends! FRIES. TATER TOTS. Cute bar in the LES area - I've personally never had to wait too long for a table, and I usually come with a group of 6 or more.  Ive been here several times, and I always enjoy the food and atmosphere here.  Service here is always decent, waters get refilled, and they check up on your.  All tables share the servers - which can sometimes get a little messy i.e. they ask you twice if you've ordered already. Must get bar food: waffle fries, and tater tots.  MUST GET.  It is so crispy and done well.  I'm obsessed.  The kalbi slider is my favorite of the bunch - but get three different ones to try since its 3 for 12$.  Skip: Popcorn shrimp dish - not sure what the official name is on the menu, but it was soggy and did not have that wow factor.  The clams were also not memorable.Drinks are weak here - which is disappointing.  They range from about 10-12$ and I'd expect to taste some more alcohol.  If you're a girly drink type of person - this is the place for you.Most definitely will return, esp on a Tues or Thurs to try their taco HH - and when I'm in the mood for some classic bar food.  Also - if you come in a larger party, THEY ADD TIPS INTO YOUR CHECK - not a complaint on my part but something to note.",https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Ar_nv2NgDxcHsWbtezjmfA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/39wqmkMbYh6byFkK1gFDmg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Pj6ldvt5AqOcbXzS7VXfvw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6DlbBy-qQyF3YfB4ob1bMA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uwD6Xls9O6Hqq4meDo2_sw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fDetsGtCHxRPDkrAx9i-pA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bjLyR16IBA1l15aJFYmnIQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PoZDeZU__Nj1i3zJHOR_2g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/arzBiNOhtgFjRUvm6LGBpA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-O3ZYis4-KHZsXFUJ-efkw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QCqVbWAVdNzRSBxdC5MPTA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HRPR4OWBGJEG306RgBfodg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/auo_FoVmXPgPnYspHr_UDQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Suv5ONJEE52OIKb80Ksjmw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WO9YOzg_0ie27GQpHq9skA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gL0kAmtaPakJYYpwzCM5RQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4oocQcPa_1xezTNBWhVeEw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/z8MNpAkyRj-XQ80Kdacymw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/V1vBAKctGTczFG8BRAM50A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UUvifyr9p8VxdUTLfZH7Xg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OJqLnvDr76vYs0mCcsI6DQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/C7hLcUP5qi7vmAVYNkQh0w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/upSLUnfKZ_vVFSlFMX64Qg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/k8xAq81FoAGZK-0zVLzTgQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_6vEpXpx4A69tUnTH6XddA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vUQLJRrHhr5PEbVzgyX5NA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xRkOaKImdxGE2i3zDqrk6g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rbcRqcCT-sFlPRH_9UKEpw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/sYgATvkIsQ7G5doJrgEvGw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MHm2fR9cGGJQew1sIfv7XA/258s.jpg
https://www.yelp.com//biz/shanghai-asian-manor-new-york,shanghai-asian-manor-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Shanghainese,NA,NA,"This is by far one of the best Shanghai soup dumplings places in Chinatown. Delicious fast, efficient &amp; great service. Everything about this place gives me the good feels cause everything that I have ate here has made my soul feel even better. I'll let the pictures do justice. Truffle Soup dumplings ::drool::Make sure you order enough to at least get 2 for yourself!! I only had one, this was over a week ago now, and I'm still kicking myself for not ordering more! Found this place on Yelp. Thank you yelpers! Got there around 4pm on a Friday with my family of 8. After walking like 10 blocks from the subway, my family was all hitting their Hangry wall and probably would have killed me and ate me if we had to wait in a long line. (Yeah, they're savage like that.) But LUCK was on my side! The large group at the only large table was just leaving. So we were able to sit down in 5 minutes!! (I hear, it can be much longer) The staff was friendly and pretty on point. Except if you really want water. It seemed like the one thing that was a hassle to get. Ordered:#8 shrimp dumplingBlack truffle dumpling#11#38 Large egg drop#124 water cress w/ golden mushroom No frills, good food. My cousin was craving soup dumplings and Chinatown seemed to be the half way point between all of us. We showed up to Shanghai Asian Manor a little before 7PM, before a rush of people came in. We didn't have to wait but after we were seated, I noticed the crowd by the door slowly growing as our meal went on. Service at Shanghai Asian Manor is great, the servers are friendly and attentive. The food comes out quickly and is quite tasty.Between the three of us, we split (3) orders of pork soup dumplings, (1) order of the Szechuan-style wontons, (1) order of salt &amp; pepper pork chops, (1) order of scallion pancakes and (1) large rice.  The soup dumplings were definitely tasty but my inner soup dumpling soul resides in Flushing. The wontons were SO good and very spicy. If my appetite allowed for it, I could've went for another order. The pork chops were filling, the portion was huge but was a little underwhelming without dowsing it in the dipping sauce. The scallion pancakes were OK. I highly regret not trying the truffle soup dumplings so I will definitely order that the next time around.In general, I thought our meal here was great. I definitely plan to return in the near future to try out other menu items! This place is more like 3.5, but I'll round up and give 4 stars. Delicious soup dumplings. Tried one of each. The pork, pork and crab, and pork and truffle. One thing I thought was lacking is that there wasn't that much soup inside the dumplings. But the pork and truffle one was so flavorful and delicious, I would highly recommend. Also tried some other things on their menu. The sesame chicken was ok, a little too sweet. The salt and pepper pork was also ok. The sauce it comes with didn't pair that great with the pork. The shrimp fried rice was standard and good. Can't go wrong there. And finally the Shanghai lo mein was the best fish besides the soup dumplings. They were chewy and so good but they give so little noodles. It was too little to share among 5 people. Anyway, relatively good service and good food. Definitely get the bang for your buck. Would recommend this place. On a mission to find soup dumplings and dim sum we decided to check out Shanghai. It was a small quaint restaurant and clean in the heart of Chinatown. Although you hear about poor and/or rude service in NYC, our server was quick and attentive. We started off with some hot and sour soup to warm up. The soup was delicious, it was thick and tart. It coated your mouth with flavour and had a nice black pepper kick going down. The Pork and Crab steamed soup dumplings were perfect. First, they came out with the soup still in them(big plus), as other places the skin is often punctured or ripped leaving the soup in the dish instead. The filling was savoury and wrapped inside a delicate dumpling skin. Next came the pan fried pork dumpling. We loved how the dumplings were soft and fluff on top with an excellent crunch on the bottom. Cantonese style is steamed all around, while Shanghainese style provides a diverse texture. The pork inside the bun was juicy and savoury. Dipped in the sauce they provided, it took them to a whole other level. The Szechuan Wonton weren't just regular wontons tossed in chili oil, the restaurant had their own unique savoury and spicy sauce. When you first bit into the wonton it had the savoury flavour, it wasn't until you swallowed that the heat kicked in. Lastly we got the shrimp dumplings, let me just say that they were hands down the best shrimp dumplings we have ever had. The skin was glossimer thin, yet durable. The filling was perfect, I could have eaten more but had to restrain myself. This restaurant set a high bar for the rest we of places tried. Din Tai Fung quality without the wait (no line for us, although others say differently), located in the heart of NY's Chinatown amongst numerous other excellent, delicious, and memorable choices. We were visiting from Minnesota so I can't say I have the breadth of experience in Chinatown cuisine as local would have - but it seems like Shanghai Asian Manor would be an exceptional restaurant anywhere but in NY it's just another really great restaurant in Chinatown. Our soup dumplings were done just about as good as you can expect - soft, juicy, and full of flavor. Our favorite of the bunch were the steamed pork dumplings, which we got three stacks. Another good choice was the boiled pork and leek dumplings. Overall, the soup dumplings were well made although lacked somewhat in presentation and size compared to other places I've been to (namely, in Hong Kong an Shanghai, as well as Din Tai Fung in Seattle). However, the prices here absolutely blow all those other places out of the water.Service was quick and efficient. We got our first batch of dumplings probably 5 minutes after our order. Restrooms are mega cramped and a little awkward since it is in the back where all the employees hang out (this place is TINY!). Cash or American Express only. Would definitely come back! Location: Located on Mott Street.Wait: I came here during lunch on a weekday. There was no wait. On the weekends and in the evenings, there is a wait.Seating: During the winter months, I would avoid sitting in the middle because you will feel the cool wind when someone enters.Food: I tried the following:Steamed Tiny Buns With Crab Meat And PorkSteamed Tiny Buns With Pork Fried Tiny Buns With Pork Steamed Pork DumplingsBeef With Rice CakesI recommend them all. The Steamed Tiny Buns With Pork was so good that the group I was with ordered 3 more orders.Overall, great Steam Tiny Buns (also known as xiao long bao). I highly recommend if you don't want to wait for Joe's Shanghai. Personally, maybe because of weather or because I was hungry, I thought the buns here were better. Came here on a Thursday at 4:45pm, after a friend recommended this place as having some of the best dumplings in NYC. 4:45pm is absurdly early by dinner standards anywhere in the world, so when we got here, we were shocked to see that there was already a line. Nevertheless, we put our names down. It was less than a 20 minute wait, and we were seated at a booth. After looking at the menu, we ordered a couple of items. For three people, we had 5-6 dishes, and couldn't finish everything. They had a special menu item, soup dumplings with black truffle, which were superb. Other standout dishes were the stewed beef with noodles in spicy soup, spicy wonton noodles, and pan fried dumplings. Everything was excellent. Service was fine. There was a funny moment when one of the waiters berated customers for keeping the entrance open (understandable though, as it's New York in winter). Will return. My friend and I were taking in the city sights and felt like Chinese food.  She had never eaten xiao long bao (soup dumplings) so off we went.  When yelp got us there, lots of people waiting (weekend tho..) so we knew it was going to be a little bit.  It was cold and rainy, but it was all good because we were so hungry....and sometimes a line means....you might be in the right place.  When we checked in, they said about 20 to 30 minutes for a table...but we got called in after 10 minutes...score!  It was probably because there was just two of us.What awaited inside was wall to wall people....only the clinking of chopsticks broke up the loud table chatter and kitchen orders....it was glorious...We were sat at a small table for two and quickly placed our order.  My friend ordered a beer, and I began the 'soup dumpling instructions' on how not to completely burn your mouth and throat...like I have done so many times...Our food quickly came...we ordered....Fried pork dumplings-these were nice and crispy...and very plump.  They were soft on the inside and had a nice crunch on the outside.  There was lots of filling but it needed a tad more seasoning.Shanghai style crispy noodle-this was really good.  It had a nice portion of 'crispy cake noodle' underneath and the sauce really soaked into it.  The veggies and meat tasted great...and this was the first plate that was cleaned.Xiao long bao-the dumplings were good, and the flavor was delightful.  They came out piping hot, and had to show my friend how to poke out and drink the juice before consuming the meat.  Although, she became impatient and started eating them whole and ended up squirting dumpling juice all over me!  I guess there could be worse things...I smelled delicious for the rest of the day!I will be back! Come here for soup dumplings! There's a few places that offer similar dishes but not like this one! We arrived on a Saturday for a late lunch. The place is packed and there's a bit of a wait but only 10 minutes. Our go-to: soup dumplings and pan fried noodles. Service is fast. Soup dumplings: The skin is on the thinner side but still holds the meat and soup well - none of them popped. There was a lot inside and the soup was delicious - flavorful and hot. The prices are also great and we end up spending less than what we would in Manhattan. Super easy and tempting to leave full and happy. PROTIP: CASH (or amex card) ONLY!!! PROTIP: no dim sum cartsbesides that, A MUST GO if you are a big xiao long bao (XLB, soup dumplings) fan! probably one of the better xlb places in the city. i will come back and update my review once i have tried every single place that offers xlb. but BONUS: they also make xue jiang bao! (pan fried bao) which wasn't bad.  we also ordered pan fried dumplings (guo tie) that were pretty good too! honestly nothing was real bad here. i had a great christmas eve brunch with my fam here! a must recommend if you're craving soup dumplings and or just looking for some good authentic asian food! Came here as a group of four at 8:30pm on Friday and waited about 10 mins compared to an hour wait at three other places in the area. Excellent crabmeat soup dumplings...so juicy and very thin skin. It has only 6 pieces in each serving (compared to 8 at Shanghai Cafe which is one of our other favorites). Wuxi spareribs were very flavorful although a bit on the sweet side. We weren't originally going to have rice but the sauce was so good that each of us finished a bowl. PS: No brown rice so only white rice available. Salt and pepper shrimp was great as well as the crispy duck. The tofu skin appetizer was great too. We left feeling full and happy. Sometimes finding somewhere to eat in china town can be very overwhelming due to all the choice! And let's be honest, not every where is going to be good. I done my research ahead of time and all yelp roads led me here! I actually tried to come here one Saturday but the wait was about 45 mins so I went elsewhere but today I was off of work and figured I'd have more luck getting a table which was true! I ordered the vegetable dumplings to start which were really good! It made me think that the other dumplings on the menu must also be good and will deffo be back to try. I also got the seafood noodle soup which was delicious! The seafood was all very fresh and it also came with baby corn, mange tour and carrots which is not something I have seen before. It's often just seafood or maybe some bak choi.Seeing some of the other 'family style' dishes coming out, this strikes me as a good place to come for a big Sunday lunch or something with a group of friends. The menu has a lot of options and for sure will be back again! The best dim sum I've had. And probably the best soup dumplings I've had. If you wanna eat here be prepared for a wait. But it's sooo worth it! We had array of things, but my favorites were the pork soup dumplings and the vegetables. Everything tasted fresh and were decent in portion size for the prices. Definitely can't wait to visit NYC again and eat here! Whenever I visit New York or California, I am always excited about two things : delicious, greasy Chinese food and being in dim sum heaven. Shanghai Asian manor is located within the heart of Chinatown, New York. I love their fast-pace service and it's understandable as to why their service is quick; they get extremely busy. The significant other and I avoided a long wait due to the restaurant having only two seats open upon us entering the establishment. We shared soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, and general tso's chicken. All were very good, but we were both very impressed by their soup dumplings!!Also, the business only accepts cash and American Express. I believe that they just started implementing this action, because they had signs posted all over the restaurant stating that they had change their form of payment on September 1. Don't worry, there's an ATM a block down from them. Delicious.Cheap.Friendly.Helpful.Accommodating.Semi clean.Great flavors.Many options.Authentic.Came back 2 days in a row cause my friends insisted on eating well and with a cheap bill. Typical authentic Asian place in Chinatown. Will be back again for sure!Happy eating. This isn't the most authentic of Shanghainese restaurants, especially in NYC Chinatwon, but the food is quite good! The staff was actually pleasant (surprise!), and we were seated quite quickly even though it was busy. One thing you MUST remember is that they only take CASH or AMERICAN EXPRESS. Make sure you have enough cash, or you'll probably have to make an embarrassing dash at the end of the meal.I decided not to order the xiao long bao because... I didn't see a middle-aged or older Asian person in a small corner making them. Sorry, but I like that fresh made xiao long bao! However, I did get the steamed watercress and shrimp dumplings that they're known for, and they were surprisingly good! The salt and pepper squid were perfectly fried: crunchy on the outside and just tender on the inside. Certainly not overcooked! Now for the actual Shanghainese dishes: the meatballs (lion's head) were well seasoned and cooked to perfection. I was so full, but I still managed to gulp downone more meatball. The watercress and golden mushrooms were also delicious, although perhaps a bit too oily. The best part is that the portions are generous! There was easily enough for 2 full meals, and I'm glad to report that the food reheated well the day afterwards. If you're looking for authentic Shanghainese food, there's better places. If you're just looking for good Chinese food, this place is a bargain! Cannot believe that I have never written a review for Shanghai Asian Manor. This place is my second favorite soup dumpling restaurant in New York City. My favorite in the city is still Shanghai Caf. The soup dumplings here contains less ginger taste. Of course also order the zha jiang mian. This place had a 5 star rating from me before I went back the second time.The first experience here was great. I went with a group of friends and enjoyed a fantastic meal at such an affordable price. The chili oil and wontons are so so good and almost everything I had that day I loved. The black truffle soup dumplings are so worth the extra bucks. If you haven't had them before, they are a treat, but you couldn't eat too many of them. It is great to try and experience.The soup dumplings in general are great and the skin around the dumpling is perfectly thin and delicious. The second time I came here I was so excited to have another great meal, but it was lackluster at best. I got the regular beef noddle soup thinking it would be similar to the first one I got, but I think the waitress messed order up. My friend got the beef and broccoli and there was just no flavor there. I am going to try this place again and hope they just had an off day. This is my favorite Shanghainese restaurant in NYC. I come here pretty often. It's one that I recommend to all my friends who visit because the food is delicious, the space is spacious (compared to Joe's Shanghai), and the price is affordable. You'll really get the bang for your buck here. Here are some dishes that I usually order that are musts:- Steamed tiny buns with pork (soup dumplings) - Pan-fried pork dumplings (I usually don't order pan-fried dumplings at restaurants but theirs are really good)- Shanghai style pan-fried noodles - Shanghai Lo Mien with mixed meat and shrimpSometimes, I'd also order their sesame chicken, fried rice, rice cakes, and Thai iced tea. I don't think you can really go wrong with anything on the menu. They also have photos of their dishes hanging on the walls - those are usually good!There's also usually a long wait here especially during lunch and dinner. So go early and tell them your name to reserve your seats. But if you don't want to wait, their sister restaurant (I believe) is a few blocks away and it's called Shanghai Asian Cuisine. Bring cash! They used to accept credit card but now they only accept American Express. Also, my photo does not do this place justice.",https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/O3Md1QIqHqd1WUDBAuo7_Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WPIJQb7WWWbtVe6LJZDzfA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1nzItfKO4vPE0WsLmC1JiA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9jWwS0rxUakj1x_syH-dpQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HMBqcch5cnW9P3D2uw87hg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ajJZSwARbzVbzkq-XPpPqw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MubafX9gqY49n6L-BHOs9g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tKkeQDSeWI-_0UpaoijKKw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mOViTofoFdVsXLI_I4jnEg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7P7ruAq9M-Qw8da1OpL-VQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3nvNfBepOlv_sBXtukYKgQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lEwnPCa5uvkG_YUKBSXKnw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Z64W9Zc6QiZBJzgIO_fTXw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GebiLXJ42UoW8pnVadCMYg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LkM8BslmLgjfq00QmC5L0Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/eQ15wUBwl-CQ6GMx0Wp8tA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RF6NkvAkzgMccC7vwe8Smw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AxZ1UJywS4qHE7E8oTbK8A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/llCH-mlsEprpzmMAnPxeag/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Qq8CZUbRCjKSUNWwrpb9Tw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FqPB216mIL02m-zKejFIng/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cXz7nh5abpXdHGq0TszJ1Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/06ERCNlCS46A32sFhQ500g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/U5IwHDoXAxFFmse76b7WlA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Eapgx5VZf2uTMo7yW0Hs-A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/230QwstEJn09cCOftIfe2A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/M3Dc-wDMHWxtLNT16z5O2A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zkTMlLIXIP5e-AjoKDbsbQ/258s.jpg,NA,NA
https://www.yelp.com//biz/shanghai-cafe-new-york-4,shanghai-cafe-new-york-4,New York,10002,NY,Shanghainese,Dim Sum,NA,"This place is Quality not Quantity ( you won't see all the dim sum as you would see at dim sum breakfast)steam pork bun: THE BEST , they were sesame seed covered, and soupy broth(nice surprise) with full portion of pork (unlike most places that place shavings/dried of pork inside), they browned on the bottom and the dough was not drysoup dumpling: great broth flavorable, good size was manageable to eat sits in spoon nicely so you can put some vinegar inside, and  good rice vinegar was not saltypeanut noodles: were good rice noodlescallion pancake: were crispy and not oilyBubble tea was ok ,  i expected to be ticker it was more like juice.They are very fast service , no wait for table. Thieves - they changed the bill by an additional $5, then when they overheard us questioning the difference a tiny boyish woman came over to harangue us about the tip and how tips work. Since it was our first day on earth it was helpful to find out that these thieves who gave us fast food customer service expected a 15% tip and that is what we should obviously give. She was told the tip is a recommendation and that because of their incredibly rude and poor service they would be getting NOTHING. Never go here. Value: 7/10Experience: 6/10Taste:: 7.10Known for their soup dumplings, but everything else seems just meh.Value: We got the pork soup dumplings, spicy wontons, and red bean buns for $15. As with most places in Chinatown, it's a good amount of food for a low price. Experience: The three of us shared a large round table with 2-3 other parties and seating was definitely a bit crowded. You have to be quick when ordering since the servers have so many other people to attend to. Taste: The soup dumplings were full of soup. It was flavored very well and I almost didn't even need the soy sauce. The wontons had the same filling I think and had a spicy peanut sauce on it. The red bean buns look store bought and had almost no filling, would not recommend Highly recommended by my Leo Sista Cynthia Z!After a long day me and Cynthia Z walking from Koreatown to Chinatown. We stopped by Shanghai Cafe for dinner. Holy moly this place was super duper packed! You must lined up to get a table...why not give customers a number like most restaurants. We decided to share table but I didn't know it was with six other people so crowded and not enough elbow space. Me and Cynthia Z shared a Pork + Crabmeat Xiao Long Bao and Pan Fried Noodles with Shrimp, Scallop, and Crabmeat (more like fake crab meat). Ooo the xiao long bao is tasty but I want more soup. There's nothing to pick up the bao besides your chopsticks which I ripped two...there goes my soup lol The two of us were definitely full and cheap prices! Busy...busy...super crowded but with good reason! The food is good, the service is fast and the price is low!!! Very casual, you will most likely be seated in extreme close proximity to strangers! Good selection of Dim Sum which is what we came in for! Will go back on future visits toChinatown! This is one of our favorite spots for juicy soup dumplings in Chinatown. Skin is thin and there are 8 pieces per order (compared to 6 at some other restaurants). Paired two orders with shredded pork noodle soup made it a perfect late lunch on a cold day. PS: two of us were seated right away at 2pm on a Sunday. I love this place!!! Every time I'm in New York I stop to eat here. It on the boarder of China Town and Little Italy. Think dumplings followed by Gelato...life can't get better. This is a cash only establishment, please keep that in mind. When you walk in it is always busy with waitstaff and customers everywhere. They offer community tables, so if you are in a hurry expect to sit with strangers, I personally like it and think it adds to the experience. Who knows maybe you'll make a new friend. If you want to sit with just your party it might be a bit but they will accommodate you. The decor is a mixture of bamboo plants, neon signs and that's about it. The lighting is perfect for eating and the noise of excited conversations adds to the atmosphere. Hands down get the soup dumpings. I'm a purist with my dumpings so I go with just pork. Don't plan to share, you will want your own. We traditionally also order crispy duck, scallion pancakes, broccoli with garlic sauce and warm milk tea. You can't go wrong with the food.The only thing about this place is that it is fast. You sit, order, eat and go. It's really not a place to hang out and socialize but it's so worth it for the heavenly pockets of handmade soup dumping joy. Go get some, you'll be hooked! This is my one of my go-to XLB places in Chinatown since it hasn't received the hype that Joe's Shanghai has while still serving better XLBs than they do. My go-to menu items to order when I come here are the crab meat and pork XLBs, pork and chicken pan fried noodles, pig ears and the scallion pancakes. The XLBs that they offer here are succulent sacks of dough filled with meat filling and hot soup on the inside, so definitely be careful when eating them so you don't burn your mouth! The demand for them is always high here so they come fresh out of the steamer every time. The pan fried noodles that they offer here are flavorful with the gravy and also crunchy. The service here is what you'd typically expect from a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. They only accept cash here, so make sure to go to the bank first for cash! I came here with a large group of people for dinner on a Friday night. Though the restaurant was packed with a line waiting, the turnover was quick and we were seated in less than 10 minutes. We ordered 3 crab and pork dumplings, 2 pork dumplings, a cha chang noodle (black bean noodle), lo mein with chicken, garlic eggplants, and Shanghai rice (pork, chicken, shrimp over rice). Highlights: black bean noodle - the flavor was rich and the black bean sauce was not skimpily given. Chinese eggplant in garlic isn't one to miss -- that is usually a star side dish for any Chinese restaurant. Let's talk soup dumplings -- they're delicious but they don't make the top few dumplings spots in New York. For one, most places in Flushing will most likely have better and cheaper soup dumplings (Nan Xiang is a winner). Compared to places in the city, I still prefer Shanghai Cafe Manor's dumplings slightly better. All in all, I'll definitely be back. Both small and large groups are easy to be seated. Service is quick, food is good, and it's cheap. **CASH ONLY** After a long day in New York City, what is better than a dinner over soup dumplings. This was my first time here, where I was brought here by my friends. They stated that this is one of the best and cheapest soup dumplings spots in Chinatown. The soup dumplings were amazing. The soup and the meat fuzed together really well. I also got the Shanghai style noodles which was also A+. If you are around Chinatown, I would definitely give this place a shot. This is my to go place for soup dumplings. I ordered the #2 soup dumplings, 8 pieces for $5. If you ever decide to stop here to eat, I recommend the soup dumplings, cold sesame noodles and the Shanghai pan fried noodles.The service is quick and the staffs are friendly when they aren't in a rush to get tables ready for the next customers. Cheap eats! Wait: 10 minute wait in a Weekday (Thursday) during lunch time (12:30 pm).Space: Place was packed with mainly tourist.Service: place was packed. As a result I felt rushed eating. Unlike the other shanghai dumpling places, they made eating there seem like a factory. I had to request multiple times from the server for sauce. There was no refill for water.Food: food was okay. I would on recommend soup dumplings. However, this is the first place I know of that don't have tongs for the soup dumplings. As a result, it was challenging picking up the dumplings without spilling the soup.Food was okay but service was horrible. There are other soup dumpling places in Chinatown to try to not feel rushed. The other dishes I tried were below average. Great spot to get XLBs! It's a small space, as is to be expected for Chinatown, so I don't recommend a huge group outing. Service isn't great either because they just want you in and out. So keep all that in mind when planning your trip.However, the soup dumplings are bomb. Get them and the pan-fried noodles to share. The portions are generous and you will never leave hungry. Totally enjoyed my meal! 8 dumplings for $6.50? Yes please!The soup dumplings here were amazing! A lot of places have thick-skinned dumplings, but theirs were pretty reasonably thin. Nothing like those at DTF but they were some of the thinnest I've had otherwise. The dumplings were served fresh, filled with piping hot soup on the inside. The soup was delicious, as was the pork filling.Cash only! After pressing @FoodBaby for the best soup dumpling place in Chinatown...he led me in the direction of soup dumpling heaven. Shanghai Cafe was everything I wanted in a soup dumpling joint, and dim [then] some! We knew the deal about cash only, quick service, and close seating arrangements. However, that didn't stop us. The 40 min subway ride was well worth the 30 minutes we spent in the restaurant. After we bobbed and weaved through Chinatown we eventually found the joint and were seated right away! Our table was full with people, which was odd at first, but we soon got over the feeling. What we got:-Pork Soup dumplings (the best I've had this side of the Mississippi) -Crunchy noodles w/ chicken and veggies (different texture, but DAMN good!) -Scallion pancake (succulent and fresh AF) We can't wait to head back for, dare I say, New YEARS! Thanks @Foodbaby for the recommendation. Love XLBs and scallion pancake so I had to head here after arriving to the City. I also ordered a crispy pan fried noodle dish too because the portions were kind of small. The XLBs were tasty and very juicy. The scallion pancakes were good but expensive ($5) for one pancake. The crispy pan fried noodle was good and well portioned. Service is lackluster and typical for any Chinese place. Probably will look elsewhere. We were in Chinatown and looked up the best place to eat, and of course, this place came up - unfortunately it did not live up to the hype. We ordered a handful of items of which not  all were good. My recommendations include the jelly fish appetizer (my husband tried it for the first time and loved it), and the seaweed egg drop soup. We ordered a ""seafood fried rice"" where there was practically no seafood in sight. The kung pao chicken was good and just like you could get at any Chinese restaurant. The crab noddle dish we got had almost no crab in it and was surprisingly bland. The most disappointing dish was the crispy duck (which is a chef's recommendation). It had an oily taste to begin with and they place it on a sauce that makes half the dish lose the crispyness (bottom side). Service was quick and over all friendly. We were seated right away and food came out shortly after we ordered it. I come here for the soup crab meat with pork dumplings and like a small white rice this comes up to around 10$ which is affordable for a meal. I love this as a quick meal but sometimes it can get too loud with drunk tourists which can get annoying. Sometimes it's too crowded and you'll have to wait a while to get served. Yo, there's always that triangle where you have to compromise on one thing, right? Good food, good price, good service.Okay, maybe you'll have to compromise on service *sometimes* but that's usually cause they're too busy! Now, this is my go-to for cheap sit down food in Chinatown, and if you got a better one... lemme know. Let's get into it:(!) THE SPREAD: Appetizers: Szechuan style wontons. // Main course: Crab and pork soup dumplings, pork soup dumplings, salt and pepper pork chop, Shanghai style pan fried noodle(!) HOW IT DID: The spread has been fine tuned over the course of many visits and will always leave me with leftovers. The dish to note, outside of what everyone's mentioned is the salt and pepper pork chop. The jalapeno gives it a nice kick akin to what I've loved since childhood--the salt and pepper squid entree at nearby Hop Kee. If you haven't yet ordered the pork here, please, please do. You won't regret it.(!) SEATING / AMBIENCE: It gets crowded and you might end up being seated at a communal table but you won't pay them any mind. You might even make a friend. It's got a nice hustle and bustle to it, and you'll always remember it in a neon pink vibe. Or is that just me? Hmmm....(!) TIDBITS: Cash only. Chase is across Canal. Citibank isn't too far from that. Credit union co-op folks, there's a McDonalds and a 7-11 near the NQRW/6 subway station on Canal. Let's caveat this review with the fact that it's not a XLB review bc I don't eat meat. Okay, moving on. Lezz be real. I've eaten at hundreds of Chinese restaurants of varying cuisines in my lifetime. People boast about Joe's and Shanghai Cafe bc they're supposed to be some kind of amazingly wonderful finds. Welp, sorry to burst your bubble...but they're not. The scallion pancake is some sort of deep fried concoction?! That was not okay. It should be pan fried, my friends. The steamed veggie dumplings had a pretty thick wrapper on them. So thick that I had to stop eating them at the folds. Ick. And then the lo mein. I mean, you can't really mess those up. And I guess they pre cut them for you...so are they hand pulled here or not?? Idk how I feel about that. Flavor-wise, not the worst. But definitely not the best. Tables are jam packed into this spot. And can we talk about the clubby light happenings?? Uh, it was 2pm on a Saturday and they had this dim pink and blue light situation happening inside. So strange. Not authentic. Catering to the wrong crowd. 2.5 stars rounded up to a 3 bc I'm feeling a little generous. Would I come back? Prob not.",https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rpSej1BuKlwqNEorjGh39A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6u748G6ZQXFUJkRGpRUC0g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XL3ixrAwSJCqdyixFTSFQw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ruX8pAbgsFhsKYkBFResgA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7jDNsOmY0ND51EYLmCFYkA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dZZx3h_CJA-qt8CRTBWnmw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QBXAVwftzZnKS4JN0ScYOQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rRT26sAjRmu4HQ2gUOv6-A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Ax0uoPBLhP-D8ZjkK5Dkfg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zuizw-k3l1N22hR8vnM_jA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OKNb4NXnPDY6qbhQ377dgQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LR3hXf3JPkeylxBeT55Gog/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Qhn3f8stZpZjb0lj2kGuNA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gTjKCKsZt5_m6TOhGXXZhw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Fa-2sNAoWAr3jtoPhVBmhQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/B9_wU043Ji132UEo2QyOrA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7CWTTclAq_t5C5UOQoPt0Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/McQvj4x0ywPZ3O8mhlBaVg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DCbShoM8_zELHe9m32FYFg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wYyN9Ymp69TfYmhe9GNEfQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hfQEf33M8nxqP0UjXv-uCA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Tm1GGqX8sSNgMb0h4hjwAg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PdEKRapd-UV43jY7uOIbSQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hZR-yymxPtS-kn5hzQ_XFQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8msV_edigdQUa1hf2bVTcA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KyIETfJaRdonu_yrsiqtig/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Q07-GCZunzGqwtozQg-9JA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DAxwlk1f_nj9yZSyK5jZFg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9a6z1btF5FNCS9QestojbA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RuiOkv04s0-d2k0Q734BxQ/258s.jpg
https://www.yelp.com//biz/shopsins-new-york,shopsins-new-york,New York,10002,NY,Diners,Breakfast & Brunch,Chocolatiers & Shops,"Had a great chilaquiles here. I'm used to eggs over easy, but it was really tasty scrambled too. The eggs were done just right, and I loved the taste. The veggies were slightly on the salty side for my taste, but I sometime add no salt at all when I'm cooking, so this is something I run in to often. All the ingredients were cooked just right, and somehow stayed hot all the way through my meal.I really have to thank these guys! I got here a couple minutes before they were closing at 2pm, and they still let me order and eat at the bar. Seems like they enjoy what they're doing. They're certainly good at it!Definitely worth stopping by if you're in the area! This small resturant is located in the corner of the grocery store.Second the pricing here on the dishes are a bit much. Expect to spend 55 to 65 for breakfast for two with coffee.I had the fidel skillet under the blisters on my sister's area of the menu. This skillet was layered with yummy refried beans, cheese, egg  and other goodness. I absolutely loved all of the hot sauces they brought to the table. So good.My wife got the snitzel bowl which was pretty disappointing. Visually it was very off putting. It looked as if they scraped the scraps from the remaining plates into a bowl and lined the bowl with snitzel. Yeah kinda gross. The waiter did take half the cost off the bill though for the snitzel bowl when he saw my wife didn't really touch it. Now this is a diner experience!!!!Venue: (3/5) Hidden in the Essex St Market, it can be hard to find.  Minimal seating, but worth the experience.  Food (5/5) The breakfast is $$$ not $$.  However look at the menu with hundreds of choices and combinations.  I respect that and will come back to order other items.  (4/5) Macaroni pancake with egg and sausage - This was good the first few bites.  I think for my taste I prefer only sweet or only salty.  If you like both you should order this!  I just didn't like my choice for my self preference.Service - The service here is you order, you receive.... it is a diner. This place would get 5 stars from me, if it didn't make me sh*t my pants every time I go from fear I'll piss off the waiter and I won't get served. Fortunately the only thing that's ever happened to me was that they refused to make me a shake while I watched the people next to me get a shake. Also, save your money if you're a picky vegetarian and Vegans absolutely not welcome here. LOLOtherwise, my favorite brunch/breakfast place in NYC. The classic Mac&amp;Cheese pancakes with hot sauce and syrup is truly a must every time. The sliders, the chili, the shakes (when I can get them Heheheh)... The list is as long as the menu coz I've never had anything I didn't like there. This place is amazing!! This is not a traditional, conceptual, high end or fusion restaurant. It's  a truly unique,  personal approach to many different types of cuisines around the world. Small place, efficient service and a ridiculously long menu!! But it's worth checking all the options. My friend has been coming to this place for years in their previous location and assures all the items he has tried are amazing. It was my first time there and I loved it! They don't accept parties bigger than 4, so I wouldn't recommend a bigger group to come. Look, Shopsin's is an experience as much as it is a restaurant. You have to know what you're walking into or else you will end up as part of the entertainment. Abide by the rules and you'll be fine. Those rules being no parties greater than four, each person orders a meal, no substitutions, and no talking on the cell phone. It also helps if you're not a vegan. With his long legacy of kicking people out, I was nervous sitting at the counter right in front of the legend himself, Kenny Shopsin, but I soon realized I had nothing to worry about. Kenny was deep in conversation with another patron, and I immediately felt at home in their quirky little space. I already pored over the menu before I came and wanted the sliders, which I had heard were the best in the city. I'm no slider expert but these were definitely tasty and very filling. I slathered them with hot sauce (there are six homemade choices in a little rack at each table), and they tasted particularly amazing with the smokey deep red one. Yum. They're also one of the more affordable things on the menu. The best part is the theatrics of eating there. Towards the end of my meal, Kenny's son, who mans the kitchen, came out and screamed expletives at his dad for misplacing something in the prep station. What followed is not family-friendly enough to write here but was super entertaining and totally playful on their part. Kenny made a wisecrack about his son's sex life and just like that, it was over. My only complaints are that the prices are pretty high, and the place is tiny. Expect to wait for a table unless you get there at 10am or earlier. The service can definitely be snarky but as long as you respect their rules, you'll be fine. I actually quite liked the waiter. The well-meaning Denver native next to me tried ordering off the menu (avocado toast) and got a rude reply, but she should have known better. This is not the place to order avocado toast. I'm definitely coming back to try something more creative next time! Greatest brunch I've ever had. The guys running it are awesome people - what might come across as rudeness is really just a singular vision of the place they've created and how you should enjoy their food. Don't ask for variations unless you're on first name terms. Order quickly and be respectful. The coffee is solid. This is where I'll have my last ever meal. If you had to only eat at one place for the rest of your life, where would it be?Here. It would be here. And you would still be the happiest person in the world. I mean, I love me my mom's cooking but omaigahtheselections!Yes. Normally I would look at a menu this extensive and correctly assume that the restaurant (normally a diner) can't do anything great. Shopsin's defies that. It is a small, magical, delicious unicorn. I can eat here. Always. Anytime (although only for breakfast and brunch according to their hours). Any Day (except the two days they are closed).This is THE definition of comfort food that crosses Southern, Jewish, Indian, TexMex, did I see some Chinese as well?I am in love with everything about the shop. The small size of it; the decorations; the seating; the exclusiveness; the eff you, we only open for 4 hours five days a week; the no parties greater than 4; the just nice enough to you to serve you, but who are we fooling, we're not bffs; the CHEF. YOU MAGICAL PERSON! HOW how do you make all this good food in your kitchen?I got mac n cheese pancakes because I have never heard of that. What? How does...ooooh that's how you make it. And it's awesome. And those scrambled eggs. I dream to be able to make scrambled eggs like that at home. But hands down, my friend got the best thing on the menu: Diego. I mean I've only been there the one time (today), but what more do you need in life than waffle fries, delicious gravy, melted cheese, and three pouched eggs on top? NOTHING. Vege what? Who needs greens when you have that deliciousness.Also, the hotsauce rack is awesome. If you can handle it, I would recommend #4 for everything. It adds spice without taking out or adding flavors to what you're eating.I want to come back. For the Diego. For the Indian. For the Hash. For the okra. For whatever that other guy is having. Just a sad experience. We didn't even get through our order before we lost our appetites and walked out. I don't want to have to over look the fact that the place and the people are filthy when trying to enjoy a Sunday brunch. The service is shit and as far as the menu, it's huge, and filled with items that are sure to leave you feeling like a pile of shit all day long. As many others have commented, the menu is bordering on comical.The good part about Shopsin's is that you can order anything possibly imaginable for breakfast: they have all kinds of typical diner food from eggs, pancakes, grits, processed meats, steaks, schnitzel, huevos ranchos, waffles, breakfast sandwiches... etc. The list goes on. They also have breakfast items from different cultures, so that means you can order Indian inspired curry like things here, but you can also get Chinese style jian bings- I didn't try any of them but I'm sure they're decent.I opted for the ABC (which is eggs, sausage, schnitzel and grits). It all came in this huge bowl and I was initially concerned that they had mixed it all together- it actually turned out to be just fine. The other cool thing is that they bring you this whole thing of seven different hot sauces that come with your food- many of them are great, and have tons of flavor packed in. There are even two ghost pepper options, so you can really knock yourself out.Having tried only one of like, three hundred items on this menu, this is by no means a comprehensive review. I will say that our food took nearly 30 minutes to arrive, and this wasn't even when the restaurant was full yet, so they ARE kind of slow here. However, I suppose this is the price to pay when you come to a restaurant that serves literally everything- they wind up getting spread a little thin.Will definitely be back. Huge difference between old-time NYC attitude take-it-or-leave-it/don't ask questions shtick and outright vitriol.  We have a sense if humor; we know your history and quirky rules.  We just wanted lunch, not your utter disdain.Can't write a review of food when you are asked to leave the premises. The unpardonable crime?  Four out of five in your party order full-on meals right off the menu no special requests, but one orders just a soda because she is feeling ill.  Maybe in the context of an assholes of NYC web reality series this would be viewed as a charming and an acceptable, inside baseball slice-of-life. Until then, just serve your friends and family. We were excited to try this place as we heard good things. I never actually ate here. I sat down to eat....My husband got his food. Nearly 25 minutes later mine still didn't come out and I was told it wasn't even started. So we cancelled it. Our waiter was very nice about the situation but what type of restaurant runs like this ? One of our worst dining experiences and I didn't even get to try the food.  Side bar, if you tell them a 3 or 4 out of 10 for spice level, that will actually mean really spicy. My husband's food was average, though overly spicy. Skip it. An awesome brunch/lunch place in the back of Essex Street Market. I've walked by it so many times but had to try it today. There menu is massive - they'll definitely have something for everyone. It is a little pricey though. I would say $$$ for a breakfast place. The quality was superb though! I got an egg special that came with scrambled eggs, bacon, two pancakes, and home fries ($15). Everything was so fresh and delicious. My boyfriend got eggs, biscuit, sausage gravy, and grits (~$23). He enjoyed it and enjoyed trying multiple hot sauces they bring to the table. Their hours are different - only open certain days and until 2pm. The server was nice and efficient. THE COLD BREW WAS AMAZING. It was choclately and full of flavor ($3.5). I'd come back just for that. If you're in the area of definitely recommend trying this hole in the wall. Listen carefully and be a easy to order. This eatery is straight out of a Seinfeld episode... Highly recommend the Rueben balls. For somewhere that presents itself as an interesting spot for food in a nice market it needs serious work. The tables and floor are filthy. The quirky enormous menu is a joke, or at least reads like one. Impossible to understand and appears to be very expensive for some options. We decided not to eat and quickly left our table in case anyone was waiting for seating. Told the server thanks but no thanks and he comes back with ""knew that would happen, what was I not quick enough!?"" Embarrassing himself and the business in front of a full house. We just left, I don't engage rude staff. Decipher the menu before you even attempt to sit down if you must visit this place. Oh and there's a hand sanitizer dispenser on the walls by the tables. Screams cleanliness. No thank you. This place is inside Essex St Market so don't miss it! It's very small with limited seating but it's worth it. They are also only open for a few hours in the day so get there early! Line does get longer during prime lunch time. They also have a very very very extensive menu so I'm sure you'll find something to eat. I got the Sneaky Pete (spicy garlic bread with bacon monterey jack and tomatoes and 3 poached eggs) it is so so so good and so filling. It doesn't look much but it'll fill you up. They also give you six different kinds of hot sauce, my favorite was the garlic one. My friend and I also shared the banana ebelskivers. Definitely get it. They're like mini pancake balls and the banana isn't overpowering. It's perfect. Great sweet dish to complement the savory Sneaky Pete. If you love food and haven't been here, what are you doing???Definitely a quirky place (Do your research before going, please) but absolutely worth every penny you pay.There are rules (don't take pictures aside from food pics, know what you want to eat beforehand, no substitutions, etc.) but again, so worth it.I came here for the first time last week. There was no wait at all (on a Friday around 12 pm) but from what I understand, this is quite unusual. There are only a few tables so try to go at an off-time if you can. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. And let's just talk about the food!I got the Bravacado. Maybe not your go-to for an epic food picture but definitely delicious. (If you like eggs and guacamole, I highly recommend it) My best friend got the Y3 and was also quite happy.Shopsin's has a cash-only policy so be sure to have enough on you. I will definitely be heading back soon. Hella bomb food! Got the Gumbo and grits so good. My friend got the Mo Betta and it's to die for! Limited seating makes this place a gem! Love it. If rudeness, unhelpfulness and confusion is your thing. Check this little shit hole out. 'do you have a menu' I asked. It's taped the that closet door he says. The door that people are walking in  and out of, that door?OK. Fine. The menu is font size 8 and literally hundreds of items. No reasonable human  oil read this thing on opening and closing door.Anyway, we sit.Two Americanos please. 'what's an EAmericano the cretin asks. OK. OK. Two straight black coffees. Jesus, how hard does this have to be?What kind of toast do you have I ask. We got everything, it's on the size 8 font menu with the literally hundreds of items. I  the top corner under a specials post it note.Alright shit heel. Can I get a side of toast, a side of avacado and a side of bacon. I spotted these things in this jungle of a menuAnd for her he asks. She's gong to split mine.We can't have people splitting meals here he says.If being a shit heel is the shtick at this place, they've accomplished it. Well done folks. You also earned a deservedly scathing review and earned and grand total of $2 for your crappy coffee. Been coming here for years and was recently turned away with my 4 and 5 year old. The hostess and staff were total jerks. What I would give to get those big gratuities back. I have seen them turn people away here before I should have known better. They will discriminate against anyone. Hence changing my review from 4 stars to 1 star. TIP if you really want to go here: Don't come with more than 2 people, dress like a hipster and whatever you do avoid Saturday and Sunday morning when they are prone to be ornery.",https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jYY-r5gX16jHDv3C8RVeTA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/w4J0LMltDmV7UPbbL9vsWQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DkkIXspJ7bWiNqJ1vS9wBA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TaXgyn9N2bBhVp29t2R9hg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZrSYtTKiuhmspWR2LgKsrA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/aZ3fjT4z99o_c9aefr8G3g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7FHeMWeLzfIsuc3yX_1P6Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3QX-uEjH5BBhFiRZn1TbuA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zbsjUuFl2_DR5TykUSOxuw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0dNrlVQdP0-fJcd8VGJwRQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jiAeoPNLLMtmwEhMwASgWw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GTs09J451zuTD__OiTTwgw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IISv-WA7DTreVFPJCRoKZw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6YdttGCj4hqfDu0MjYMiPA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kV54PThuRjQ43hVxCKMn1w/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wDRBUiVSnNz8Zc1nh8nokQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/i0CNYqq8up_pzHG4qhEJGA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gMB_32XCyRyW4jwMdxMP0g/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-mCeNsHQ8D5oao4e6DoDAg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xpnhYZC0Yyh4UxQ4VCMIDg/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uo6ZkdRzx1EwhzDALbQJ0Q/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3mC0P1Kx4g7RzFhDO3Z9Jw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fxfnfP1uegG1FjT7lnU9qA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0ZvZarya1GOidNVrSw7dtw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RpRU5NOUiUo2qZs7u1Jlrw/258s.jpg,https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gWFprO-vSnqPG3HR1ECfmQ/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0OSbWk0GVmEnsN91HpTqjA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ATUKUHLNyCU9qJrsEOgO9A/258s.jpg,https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/eT86_03nFlLG1-8EJ58vIA/258s.jpg,https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qpyGr3DBqso5IGYFz5BEXw/258s.jpg

# Yelp_Crawler_App

## Introduction
There are two different apps in this repo. These are live apps. The first app is the first link below lets you run a query using the Jelinek-Mercer smoothing language model on various busineses and restaurants. The second app is how I retrieved the data from Yelp, which is what I built to retrieve the data. To build the search engine I first had to crawl Yelp to get the data then I built my search engine. Both apps are below.

Using R software I was able to parse the data from Yelp. Below are some key packages that helped me scrape and build the app: 

1. **XML** package (R package)
2. **httr** package (R package)
2. **shiny** package (R package)
2. **ggplot** package (R package)
